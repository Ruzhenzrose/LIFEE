# Acknowledgments

DURING THE COURSE of my research, many people who knew, worked withand had professional and personal connections to Audrey Hepburn sharedtheir memories and impressions with me. Among them, I am grateful most ofall to Jacqueline Bisset, Patricia Bosworth, Karen Cadle, Christa Roth,Marian Seldes, Michael Tilson Thomas, Frederica von Stade, Robert Wagner,Martha Hyer Wallis, John Waxman, Arthur Wilde, Audrey Wilder and RogerYoung.

Andrew Lownie kindly put me in contact with Adrian Weale, one ofEngland’s experts in the field of military intelligence, who enabled me toclarify important details about Audrey’s father.

Not for the first time in my career, the personnel at the Margaret HerrickLibrary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Beverly Hills,provided me with expert help and guidance. Stacey Behlmer, Coordinator ofSpecial Projects and Research Assistance, pointed me to many items I mightotherwise have overlooked; at every stage of this project, she offered themost generous, enthusiastic and friendly support. Her colleagues weresimilarly gracious, each offering particular contributions: Barbara Hall,Research Archivist; Sandra Archer, Head of Reference Services; FayeThompson, Photograph Department Coordinator; Kristine Krueger, of theNational Film Information Service at the Herrick; Jonathan Wahl, LibraryPage Supervisor; and staff members Matthew Severson and KevinWilkerson.

At the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, I was fortunateonce again to have the invaluable aid of Ned Comstock, Archivist in theDoheny Memorial Library; and of Haden Guest, Curator of the Warner Bros.Archives.

In the last years of her life, Audrey Hepburn gave herself tirelessly to thecauses of UNICEF, the United Nations International Children’s Fund. InDenmark, Anne Tennant helped me to contact the right colleagues atUNICEF’s New York offices. There, I met a remarkable team of dedicatedpeople who made available to me documents of singular significancedetailing Audrey’s years of service to UNICEF. I offer deep thanks toAdhiratha Keefe, John Manfredi, Fran Silverberg and Upasana Young.UNICEF also granted me permission to publish important photos; in thisregard, I received very kind assistance from Ellen Tolmie and NicoleToutounji. Also in the New York office, I must acknowledge GloriaAdwutum, Margaret Majuk, Patricia Moccia, Edwin Ramirez, Sharad Sapra,Veronica Theodoro and Maria Zanca.

Thanks to the kindness of Library Supervisor Gary Browning at theMuseum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills, I was able to view AudreyHepburn’s early television performances.

Simone Potter, Senior Picture Researcher at the British Film Institute,cleared my way to finding some of the telling photos in the book.

Rose Puntillo, Business Center Representative at the Beverly WilshireHotel, Beverly Hills, provided helpful and generous office assistance.

THOMAS SMITH was my research assistant in London; I acknowledge him withmy thanks and admiration. He tracked down obscure texts, scoured archivesand libraries for rare articles and essays and applied his first-rate scholarshipat every stage. In the United States, I was fortunate to have the help ofDestiny Leake, who helped me locate important letters in the Beinecke RareBook and Manuscript Library at Yale University. Frank Turner, LibraryDirector of the Beinecke, supervises an admirable staff—among them NaomiSaito, Public Services Assistant.

Debra Campbell, chair of the Department of Religious Studies at Colby

College in Waterville, Maine, graciously provided me with a copy of herelegantly written and scholarly paper, “The Nun and the Crocodile,” whichclarified several fine points in the life of the novelist Kathryn Hulme, one ofAudrey’s closest friends.

Bernard Dick, author and scholar, pointed out to me important aspects ofLillian Hellman’s play The Children’s Hour and its film version.

The esteemed playwright and screenwriter Robert Anderson has been adevoted friend and an advocate of my writing for more than thirty years.During many long conversations, he confided his relationship with Audrey,entrusting the details without restriction. I am grateful for his trust.

My brother-in-law, John Møller, is a talented graphic designer and asuperb technician with a fund of creative ideas: he performed miracles as hetransferred dozens of Audrey Hepburn photographs onto disks. Thispainstaking task, requiring an artist’s eye and many arduous days, Johndispatched with a cheerful, generous dedication of his time.

For various kindnesses extended to me during the course of my work, Iexpress my warm thanks to Mary-Kelly Busch; Mart Crowley; Mary Evans;Lewis Falb and Gerald Pinciss; Mike Farrell and Shelley Fabares; JoshuaRobison; and Erica Wagner. As always, Mona and Karl Malden have aspecial claim on my gratitude for their loving endorsement of me and mywork.

For almost thirty years, I have been represented by my incomparablefriend, Elaine Markson, who has guided my career so judiciously and withsuch wise affection. She and her colleagues—Gary Johnson, Geri Thoma andJulia Kenny—are, each and all, very dear to me indeed.

From day one of this project, I was fortunate to have the enthusiastic andwarm support of Shaye Areheart, a generous, discerning and perceptivepublisher. To my editor, Julia Pastore, I offer very many thanks for herconstant friendliness, her alacrity, her astute comments on the manuscript,and her shrewd suggestions where improvement was indicated. In Julia’soffice, Kate Kennedy dispatched numerous tasks cheerfully and efficiently,

and Janet Biehl was my meticulous and attentive copy editor.

AUDREY HEPBURN would have admired and loved Ole Flemming Larsen,whose name appears on the dedication page. A respected academic and agifted artist, he spent many evenings watching and discussing her films withme. All during the course of my research, he contributed valuable ideas, andthen he listened patiently as I read aloud parts of the manuscript. Most of all,Ole has blessed my life with very great serenity and happiness, theconsequence of devotion deep and true. For that and for so much, I amgrateful every day, far beyond my ability to express. I share this book withhim, as I do my life.

[ 1929–1950 ]

At school in England, 1938.

# Chapter One

1929–1939

THERE HAD BEEN bright sunshine when they left the English shore, butmidway across the Channel, dark clouds swept overhead, and the wind hadshifted from breezy to almost gale force. Now, as the ship headed for theContinent, they were suddenly caught in a late-winter storm. Cold rainwhipped across the deck and stung their faces as the ferry rolled and pitched.Years later, the baroness could not recall feeling any anxiety during thecrossing, and therefore she had not communicated any fear to her two smallboys as they steadied themselves against her.

This squall was far less threatening than the typhoon she had once enduredin the South China Sea; nor was it as threatening as the violent conditionsthat routinely battered the ships that had taken her from Asia to SouthAmerica or from the Netherlands to the East Indies. Thanks to the composureof the Dutch baroness, her eight- and four-year-old sons could face the heavyweather cheerfully. But if she did not hold their hands tightly, the wind mighteasily sweep the children overboard. Better to take them inside for hotchocolate.

On her way to the ferry’s café, the baroness passed her husband in thesmall, smoky lounge bar. Warming himself with Irish whiskey, he glancedtoward her but did not interrupt his conversation with a fellow passenger. Herhusband was not the boys’ father—they were sons from her first marriage.And from his diffidence, no one in the room would have guessed that he hadany connection to this handsome, patrician woman and her two docilechildren. She heard him tell his drinking partner that he had left England totake up a new position in Belgium with great prospects. Indeed, she hoped for

the best, for him as for herself and the boys: if at last he could hold a joblonger than a month or two without succumbing to indolence—well, thatmight help secure the marriage, too. He was her second husband, and theyhad been married for three years; during that entire time, she reckoned that hehad not worked a total of three months.

Her first husband had jumped from the matrimonial ship five years aftertheir wedding, which was just four years ago, and she was left with two smallboys when she was twenty-five; now, domestic storm clouds were once againon the horizon. And she was seven months pregnant.

She had some financial resources and a share of ancestral property, for herfamily was of old European aristocracy. And she had a title: she was theDutch Baroness Ella van Heemstra, now also Mrs. Ruston. Dutch baronesseswere not a rare breed even in 1929; most democratic Netherlanders did notmind the last of the noble gentry using venerable titles—but only if theirholders adopted no airs and graces and imitated the Dutch royal family, anamiably down-to-earth clan.

The four travelers reached Brussels safely and proceeded to a rented house.There, with the help of a relative who arrived from Holland, the baronessprepared for the child’s birth while her husband went off to his job with aBritish insurance company as a minor clerk with no confidential duties. Hewas bored from the first day.

On the morning of Saturday, May 4, the baroness went into labor, and bymid-afternoon she was nursing her newborn daughter. “Saturday’s childworks hard for a living,” according to Mother Goose.

ELLA, THE BARONESS van Heemstra, was born in the fashionable Dutch suburbof Velp, near Arnhem, on June 12, 1900. One of nine children, she was thedaughter of Baron Arnoud Jan Adolf van Heemstra (once the governor ofDutch Guiana in South America—later Surinam) and his wife, the BaronessElbrig Wilhelmine Henrietta van Asbeck; both families were titled

aristocrats. The precise reasons for the baronetcies remain unclear, but ineach case both sets of Ella’s grandparents were respected jurists or judgeswith a long history of service to Crown and country. Their children, Ella’sparents, inherited the titles according to the custom of the time.

Ella’s childhood was not underprivileged: her parents owned a countrymansion, a city house and a summer cottage, and they employed a smallplatoon of servants who attended them everywhere. Photos taken of Ella inher mid-twenties show a strikingly attractive woman with fine features, darkhair, a clear, translucent complexion and a certain dignified smile, neithergirlish, coy nor seductive. She was, in other words, every bit the image of asomewhat Germanic-Victorian aristocrat, and it was, of course, theGermanic-Victorian style (overstuffed in furniture and formal in demeanor)that was the standard all over Europe—if not among the royal families,certainly among their social rivals, the landed gentry.

At the age of nineteen, Ella concluded a respectable but undemandingupper-class education, at which she excelled mostly in singing and amateurtheatricals, to the point where she expressed a desire to become an operasinger. Her parents thought little of that and instead purchased her a first-class ticket on a long steamship journey to visit relatives who worked forDutch colonial companies in Batavia—the Latin name in the Netherlands forwhat was later called Jakarta—in the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia).

There Ella blossomed and flourished. Much in demand for her fine voice,which she put to good use entertaining at parties; for her clever repartee andher air of sophistication; and for her genteel flirtatiousness, Ella impressedmany eligible young men and their parents in the colonies. On March 11,1920—five months after her arrival and three months before her twentiethbirthday—Ella’s parents traveled to Batavia for her marriage to HendrikGustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, who was six years her senior and held arespectable job. Business was thriving that year in the Indies, at least partlybecause at home the Netherlands began to experience a severe depression andrelied on the colonies more than ever.

Van Ufford’s mother was a baroness with a respected Dutch and French

pedigree, and everything augured well for a happy and profitable union. OnDecember 5 of that same year, Ella bore a son they named Arnoud RobertAlexander Quarles van Ufford (always known as Alex); and on August 27,1924, they welcomed Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford. But things soonwent very wrong. When Hendrik returned to the Netherlands at Christmas1924 to discuss a transfer from Batavia, Ella and the toddlers accompaniedhim. Early in 1925, she and her husband registered their divorce in Arnhem,for reasons that may forever remain unclear.

At once, van Ufford took ship for San Francisco, where (he said) he had agood offer of work; there, he soon met and married a German immigrantnamed Marie Caroline Rohde. With that, Hendrik Quarles van Uffordremoved himself from the lives of Ella and their two sons; the public recordshows only that he returned to the Netherlands years later, where he died onJuly 14, 1955, at the age of sixty.

And so, that spring of 1925, the twenty-four-year-old Baroness Ella vanHeemstra van Ufford was left with two babies and no husband. Her friends inHolland noted that she had become somewhat imperious, perhaps fromdefensiveness about the dissolution of her marriage, but she had a title, aDutch home with her parents and a nanny for her sons.

These benefits notwithstanding, Ella surprised her parents by returning toBatavia, and there she renewed a friendship she had earlier formed with adashing, courtly Englishman she had met even while her marriage wasfoundering. Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston, eleven years older than Ella, wasborn November 21, 1889, in Onzic, Bohemia, where his London-born father,Victor John Ruston, had worked and where he had married a local girl namedAnna Catherina Wels. Joseph’s maternal grandmother’s maiden name wasKathleen Hepburn.

When Joseph and Ella were reunited that spring of 1926, he was stillmarried to Cornelia Wilhelmina Bisschop, a Dutch woman he had married inthe East Indies. They were living entirely on her family inheritance, whichwas certainly helpful, for Ruston never really had any sort of career—normuch of a desire for one. Later identified by Hepburn biographers as an

Anglo-Irish banker, he was neither Irish nor a banker; “the sad truth is, henever really hung on to any job,” according to one of his grandsons. But hehad a calm manner, a handsome expression, dark eyes like velvet (accordingto Ella’s description) and, thanks to Cornelia, a fine wardrobe. He sported alittle moustache like an artist’s brush, and he photographed well; it was notdifficult to understand his appeal to Ella, who in any case was eager to find anew father for her boys.

She had every reason to expect that a man with a good job could be found.The direct rule by the Netherlands over the Dutch East Indies had greatlyexpanded since 1900, and Dutch strategies to control both the economy andtax revenues meant that virtually every exported item was shipped throughBatavia.

Joseph found Ella cultivated, elegant and as enamored of the good life ashe, and they enjoyed attending cotillions, military parades, fine restaurantsand sporting events. But Ella’s greatest appeal was her title—about which hejoked so often that she recognized how seriously he took it. Never mind thatthe title was a centuries-old honorific used by other ladies in Batavia—andnever mind that Ella took an office job to support herself and her boys.Joseph, besotted with all things that had a trace of the upper classes, took tointroducing her as his friend, the baroness. He understood quite clearly thatmarriage would not promote him to a baronetcy, yet he greatly valued herbackground and breeding, and perhaps most of all, he saw her family’saffluence as a very comfortable cushion in life—indeed, as a plush settee onwhich he could, when so inclined, rest and relax.

Cornelia, meanwhile, apparently complaisant and much on her own,luxuriated in the rarefied precincts of colonial life, with a home lavishlyappointed in ivory and gold (common for the white Europeans), and therewas no shortage of natives to look after their needs. Daily life among thewealthy could neatly be described in terms of a Somerset Maugham novel:the setting was not a dreary backwater outpost but a rather chic preserve forthe few advantaged foreigners who controlled the economy.

When Joseph said he could obtain a speedy divorce from his wife, Ella

accepted his proposal. Fortunately, Cornelia Bisschop Ruston made noobjections, for she had romantic interests elsewhere. Papers were drawn up,signed and countersigned on all sides, there was a quick divorce, and onSeptember 7, 1926, Ella and Joseph were married.

For a brief time, the baroness was flattered by her handsome husband, whowas at least a presentable escort in society. But she was also alert, and soonshe became impatient with his idle and morose comportment. Alas, JosephRuston was revealing himself as a common adventurer who had married herfor access to her money and the chance to live in the capacious light of heraristocratic family. He made no effort to work for a living, and he seemed tohave an excuse when, in November, a Communist revolt caused massiverioting and was put down only with great difficulty. How, he protested, couldhe go out to work in so unstable a colony? From this time, Joseph Ruston’sconversations were peppered with fervent anti-Communist declamations.

But languor, political tirades and the trivialities of social life were not inElla’s character, and she had no appreciation of those qualities in others, thegeneral public discord notwithstanding. Within a year of the marriage, therewere heated arguments about money, Joseph’s idleness and his alarmingemotional indifference to her two sons. In muted desperation, Ella wrote toher parents, who suggested that Joseph might do well to meet some of theirbusiness associates in London. This he agreed to do; he very much missedEngland in any case, and he considered London far more agreeable thanBatavia. Hence, in late 1928, Joseph, Ella, Ian and Alexander took the longjourney from the East Indies to Britain.

They arrived on Christmas Eve and leased a flat in fashionable Mayfair, afew steps from Hyde Park. The holiday season, Joseph insisted, was no timeto hunt for employment, and so he waited until February. A colleague of hisfather-in-law then made Joseph an offer of employment at a British insurancecompany in Belgium, and in mid-March the baroness and her husband againpacked their luggage, boarded the storm-swept ferry for France and thenproceeded to Brussels by train.

AT THE END of May, the newborn baby nearly succumbed to whooping cough.She stopped breathing and began to turn blue, and the nanny froze with panicand called out to Ella, who did not know panic. Adding audible prayers to herprocedure of turning, spanking and warming the infant, Ella effectively savedher life.

On July 18, ten weeks after their daughter was born, Ella and JosephRuston registered the birth with the British vice consulate in Brussels, for thelaw considered the child English by descent from her father. According to thedocument, she was born at 48 rue Keyenveld, also called Keienveldstraat, inthe Ixelles district, southeast of the center of Brussels. The child’s full legalname was Audrey Kathleen Ruston; throughout her life, Audrey carried aBritish passport.

After World War II and the death of the last Hepburn relative in Joseph’smaternal ancestry, he legally changed his surname to Hepburn-Ruston, whichhe thought very posh. The Hepburn clan, which may be traced centuries backin Scots-Irish history, had dozens of various orthographies, among themHebburne, Hy-burn and Hopbourn. Among his most notable forebears—or soJoseph said—was James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell and third husband ofMary, Queen of Scots. But the multiple branches on the Hepburn tree and thedoubtful genealogies at several critical junctures render difficult any positiveverification of this grand assertion.

THE VAN HEEMSTRA–RUSTON house in Brussels was but one of Audrey’schildhood residences. She often spent time with her grandparents at theirestates in Arnhem, Holland, and outside Arnhem, at Velp. Ella also oftentook her to visit cousins, most of all when Joseph was absent. He wasfrequently dispatched to the finance management company’s London office,and when he was at home with the family, he often attended politicalmeetings in the city center.

Whenever he returned home from a day’s or a week’s business, Joseph waswelcomed excitedly by his adoring daughter. But by all accounts, he doted on

her no more than he did on Ian and Alex. Ella taught Audrey to read anddraw, to enjoy the standard children’s classics and good music, and the childlonged to show her father what she was learning. But he showed little interestin her, and Audrey’s response to his coolness was typical of any child: sheredoubled her efforts to win his love and approval—alas, to no avail.

Audrey could always rely on her mother’s care, protection and instruction,but (like her husband) Ella was not given to overt displays of affection. AVictorian baroness to her fingertips, she was now more than ever restrained,having lost the spontaneity and gaiety of her youth. She was a serious motherwho always had her daughter’s best interests at heart, but the warmth in thatheart was cooled by her conviction that dignity forestalled cuddling, and thatanything more effusive than a perfunctory good-night kiss was indecorous.Much later, Audrey considered that her mother had been greatly hurt by thefailure of her first marriage and the obvious emotional bankruptcy of hersecond.

Photos taken during childhood show an alert, bright-eyed, smiling andpoised girl, and if her mother or half-brothers were in the picture, there wasusually an impish grin on Audrey’s face. She always treated householdservants as if they were family friends; she loved to be outdoors and to playthe usual games and pranks. Ian and Alex recalled that Audrey accompaniedthem on country walks and hikes, and they enjoyed playing charades. “Andwe were sometimes very naughty,” according to Ian. “Against Mother’swishes, we did a lot of tree-climbing.” But when Audrey was five, her half-brothers were fourteen and eleven, and they were dispatched to boardingschool; henceforth, their times together were only occasional.

In time, the clever, resourceful and cheerful child became aware of herparents’ increasing arguments and was confused by the cold war thatprevailed when they sat down to dinner. The atmosphere became so strainedthat Audrey often wept in secret, for if she did so in the presence of others,she was scolded. “As a child, I was taught that it was bad manners to bringattention to yourself, and to never, ever make a spectacle of yourself…Ialways hear my mother’s voice, saying, ‘Be on time,’ and ‘Remember tothink of others first,’ and ‘Don’t talk a lot about yourself. You are not

interesting. It’s the others who matter.’” And of course the marital problemswere never discussed in front of the child.

One of the issues was certainly Joseph’s right-wing political perspective,which Ella found increasingly bizarre.

Belgium was a stable society, but the collapse of the American economy inthe autumn of 1929 triggered a worldwide depression. In Brussels, where theelectorate was essentially conservative, the government was grantedemergency powers to regulate all trade and commerce at home and abroad—in the Congo, for example, which brought vast revenues from mining.Extremists, revolutionary socialists and German-influenced NationalSocialists were officially barred from holding office, but their numberincreased alarmingly.

By 1934, fascists could be found in virtually every government agency inBelgium—not in control, but certainly influential. At the time, Audrey had noidea that her father’s political sympathies were so right-wing, that fascistideology more and more appealed to him, and that he made frequent forays topolitical assemblies that were comprised of apprentice Nazis.

In fact, both Joseph and Ella had prejudices that embarrassed AudreyHepburn for the rest of her life.

In the spring of 1935, her parents were collecting funds and recruiting forthe British Union of Fascists, under the leadership of the notorious OswaldMosley. The April 26 issue of The Blackshirt, Mosley’s fuming weekly,featured a photo of Ella and a ringing endorsement in English so flawless itsuggests her husband’s hand: “We who have heard the call of Fascism, andhave followed the light on the upward road to victory, have been taught tounderstand what dimly we knew and now fully realize. At last we arebreaking the bondage and are on the road to salvation. We who follow SirOswald Mosley know that in him we have found a leader whose eyes are notriveted on earthly things, whose inspiration is of a higher plane, and whoseidealism will carry Britain along to the bright light of the new dawn ofspiritual rebirth.”

Eleven days later, Ella and Joseph were lunching with Hitler in Munich,accompanied by several of Mosley’s closest allies and three of the Mitfordsisters. They returned to Brussels in mid-May, having missed Audrey’sbirthday.

Soon there was a deep alienation of Joseph from his wife and daughter.Disconsolate, inarticulate, disinclined to work, dependent on his wife andcontemptuous of Jewish, Catholic and “colored” people, he seemed never tohave anything to say to Ella and Audrey, and this naturally affected hisdaughter’s spirit. “I became a rather moody child, quiet and reticent, and Iliked to be by myself a great deal. I seemed to need a great deal ofunderstanding.” As for her private playtime: “I didn’t care for dolls. Theynever seemed real to me”; she preferred the companionship of dogs, cats,rabbits and birds, which she drew in chalk and ink with remarkablevirtuosity. On the live animals, she lavished the sentiments for which shelonged and which her parents were unable to provide. “I myself was bornwith an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it,” she saidmore than once in adulthood.

“When I was little, I embarrassed my mother by trying to pick babies outof prams on the streets and at markets. The one thing I dreamed of in my lifewas to have children of my own. It always boils down to the same thing [inmy life]—not only receiving love but wanting desperately to give it.”

Small animals and the children of passersby always received her embraces—such were her attempts “to give it.” As for “receiving love,” even thesemblance of it under the guise of basic domestic security: that was forevershattered when, at the end of May 1935—with no prior threats or warnings—Joseph Ruston packed his clothes and, apparently without a word to anyone,walked out the door into rue Keyenveld, never to return.

According to some third-hand sources, Joseph had squandered much ofElla’s living trust and a great deal of the money his father-in-law had settledon him at the time of the marriage. Others claim that he had become anabusive alcoholic. But because the principals remained silent, it is impossibleto know for certain the catalyzing events for the separation. Both Ella and

Joseph were stern, aloof, critical characters, although in Ella’s favor it mustbe said that her sacrifices on Audrey’s behalf, her work to support herdaughter’s lessons and interests, betokened a real devotion of which Audreywas always convinced. “My mother had great love, but she was not alwaysable to show it…Of necessity, my mother became a father, too.”

Neither Joseph nor Ella ever wrote or spoke publicly about their marriageor its finale, and Audrey, who was just six at the time, rarely alluded to it inlater life, and then only in a few words: “I worshiped my father. Having himcut off from me was terribly awful…Leaving us, my father left us insecure—perhaps for life.” The departure of her father was, she added in 1989, “themost traumatic event in my life. I remember my mother’s reaction…[her]face, covered with tears…[I was] terrified. What was going to happen to me?The ground had gone out from under me.”

According to Audrey’s elder son, this abandonment “was a wound thatnever truly healed,” and he claimed that his mother for the rest of her life“never really trusted that love would stay.” She once alluded to this when shesaid that she felt “very insecure about affection—and terribly grateful for it.”The abandonment of 1935, she added, “has stayed with me through my ownrelationships. When I fell in love and got married, I lived in constant fear ofbeing left.”

That day made Audrey withdraw from the few friends her mother allowed—a withdrawal that must have been partly from shame; partly from a mixtureof sorrow and confusion for which she had no words; and partly from thecloud of guilt that darkens the soul of every child when a parent walks out.Did she do something to cause it? Was she in some way unlovable? Hermother assured her that was not the case. Would her father return? Elladoubted that very much. Would she never again have a father? On thismatter, Ella was silent.

“Other kids had a father, but I didn’t. I just couldn’t bear the idea that Iwouldn’t see him again. And my mother went through sheer agony when myfather left. Because he really left. I think he just went out and never cameback. I was destroyed at the time. I cried for days and days. But my mother

never, ever put him down.” (Yet according to one of Audrey’s sons, Ella“spent the war spewing poison about [Ruston], about his disappearance,about his lack of support of any type.”)

There was some consolation, however. Audrey’s maternal grandparentsarrived from Holland and took the girl and her mother to the family home inArnhem, about fifty miles southeast of Amsterdam, where the old baron hadbeen mayor from 1920 to 1921.

By the time lawyers drew up the terms of a legal separation, Joseph hadrelocated to London. To the astonishment of Ella’s family, he asked forvisitation rights with Audrey—and to everyone’s shock, Ella granted himthose rights. This may have had less to do with compassion for his outcaststate than with the fact that Ella had decided to place Audrey in a completelynew setting—an English boarding school.

At the time, the notion of sending a well-born six-year-old child abroad toschool was not considered anything but proper, generous and, for the child,an important maturing experience. In addition, Dutch unemployment was atrecord levels, and some of those without work were offered low-paying jobsin Germany; if they refused to go, their unemployment benefits ceased. Therewas also public rioting from 1934 over several measures: when womenmarried, for example, they were dismissed from jobs in public administrationso that unemployed men with families could take those positions. And inearly 1936, severe economic austerity measures were put in place by PrimeMinister Hendrik Colijn. Surely, Ella reasoned, things would be calmer in theEnglish countryside than in Holland, where suddenly there was chaos.

Despite her aristocratic bearing and sense of noblesse oblige, Ella wasessentially a pragmatist, capable of adapting to life’s circumstances anddemands; this trait she passed on to her daughter, who was taught that homewas where you made it.

If Joseph would see Audrey at school from time to time and bring her toLondon for a day’s outing, Ella believed, things could be better for the child—and the baroness herself would be a frequent visitor. Once again, however,

she miscalculated. During the time Audrey attended a small private academyfor girls in Kent, she saw her father only four times in as many years. “If Icould just have seen him regularly, I would have felt he loved me. I wouldhave felt I had a father.”

But something meant more to Ruston than visits with his daughter: he wasindeed often in Kent, but he usually dodged the school. (Once, he fetched hisdaughter and took her for a short trip over southeast England in a smallbiplane—but such excursions were the exception to his habitual neglect.) Thereason for his frequent presence near the school came to light years later.Ruston had for some time been an advocate of Mosley’s British Union ofFascists. Now, he was meeting with an old friend who had relocated fromBrussels—the notorious Englishman Arthur Tester, who channeled Nazipropaganda from Germany to the Mosley headquarters in England.According to the British historian David Turner, Tester’s partner was JosephRuston.

In light of Joseph and Ella’s earlier involvement with Mosley and withHitler, this development is not surprising—and may in fact have been themajor reason for Ruston’s return to Britain. In any case, it must be added thatElla’s connections to the BUF ceased in 1937, and as Nazism became evermore malevolent and murderous, the baroness came to regret her contact withHitler, her affirmation of Mosley and her endorsement of a cause she hadcompletely misapprehended.

Of her school terms in England, from 1936 to 1939, Audrey later said thatat first she was “terrified, but it turned out to be a good lesson inindependence…I liked the children and the teachers, but I never liked theprocess of learning in a classroom. I was very restless and could never sit forhours on end. I liked history and mythology and astronomy—but I hatedanything to do with arithmetic. School itself I found very dull, and I washappy when I was finished.”

But there was one session each week that Audrey very much loved andanticipated: the hours when a London ballet master led the girls in danceclasses. Ella visited the school on Audrey’s tenth birthday—May 4, 1939.

She arrived just in time for a dance recital that featured her daughter. Theteacher and her classmates were enthusiastic in their applause, and Audreywas glowing.

# Chapter Two

1939–1946

ELLA AND AUDREY spent the summer of 1939 with a family friend near theseaside town of Folkestone, England, where they toured the colorful gardens,admired the Georgian stone houses, lunched at the harbor promenade,strolled along sandy beaches, swam in a protected inlet of the Channel andenjoyed the outdoor band concerts.

Their summer idyll ended suddenly and anxiously during the first fourdays of September, when Nazi troops invaded Poland; Britain, France,Australia and New Zealand declared war on Germany; and the British RoyalAir Force attacked Hitler’s navy. With England now at war, Ella—convincedthat Germany would never attack neutral Holland—at once took her daughterand headed for her father’s estate in peaceful Arnhem. The old baron wasdelighted to welcome them, not least because a terrible depression hadovercome him on the death of his wife five months earlier. Before the end ofSeptember, Ella and Audrey were comfortably and securely settled in thesprawling white family mansion. That same month, Ella received the finallegal documents confirming the dissolution of her marriage to Joseph Ruston.

At the same time, Joseph was among hundreds of English fascists whowere—without indictment or trial—summarily shipped off to house arrest onthe Isle of Man. There was not a shred of evidence that Ruston ever acted insupport of the Nazi regime during wartime. And if every Englishman wholunched with Hitler and was photographed smiling and shaking his handcould be reasonably accused of high treason, then the Duke of Windsorhimself—once the (uncrowned) King of England—would have also been acandidate for arrest and internment. According to one of Joseph’s grandsons,

“In no way did [Ruston], or my grandmother [Ella] for that matter, eversupport either the war or the Holocaust. They may have supported certainFascist ideologies and belonged to the appropriate parties, but they never hurtanyone or knowingly support any system that did.”

ARNHEM SEEMED FAR from the dangers of war. With large parks, appealingfountains and waterfalls, undulating forest paths and venues for theater,music and dance, the town was a genteel sanctuary for wealthy city residentsand for tourists.

The van Heemstras celebrated a traditional Christmastide. There wereparties, visits from Ian and Alex and from relatives far and near. Audreywelcomed her uncle (her mother’s only brother), a much-respected and well-liked judge who hated all forms of intolerance and was dedicated to peace;and there was also a cousin to whom she was close in her childhood. Holidaygatherings and reunions with loving relatives always took the sting out of herfatherless situation.

That autumn and winter, many people saw not much cause for concern,despite the situations in Czechoslovakia and Poland, which had already comecompletely under Nazi hegemony. War had been declared, but it was called aphony war. Thus, at the beginning of 1940, very few Dutch people feared fortheir future—until the Nazis invaded Denmark and Norway on April 9. Eventhen, a kind of narcotized calm prevailed. The Sadler’s Wells Ballet, the greatEnglish troupe, was performing in Arnhem on May 9, and Ella took Audreyas a birthday celebration.

“For the occasion, my mother had our little dressmaker make me a longtaffeta dress. I remember it so well. I’d never had a long dress in my life,obviously…It went all the way to the ground, and it rustled. The reason shegot me this, at great expense, was that I was to present a bouquet of flowersat the end of the performance to Ninette de Valois, the director of thecompany.” She did just that, offering the spray of tulips and roses that werehurriedly accepted, for the dancers had been ordered by the British vice

consul to leave Arnhem that very night.

The next day, Friday, May 10, German armies invaded the Netherlands,Belgium and Luxembourg without warning; three days later, Rotterdam fellto the Germans after the city had been blasted by an air attack that killedalmost thirty thousand Dutch civilians: the Germans had issued a surrenderultimatum but then launched their attack before the Dutch could reply. Thesame day, Queen Wilhelmina, her family and her government fled Hollandfor London, where they directed the war effort of the Dutch navy, thecolonies and the growing resistance. Then, incendiary bombs were droppedon The Hague. Dutch soldiers, heirs to a century-long legacy of peace in theircountry, were trained and equipped for defense rather than attack, and as theminimal supplies and all the aircraft were swiftly lost, the Dutch armycapitulated and Holland surrendered.

Nazi troops and artillery then tore through Arnhem, exploiting localfacilities and despoiling where they could to support the German warmachine. “I saw German trucks coming in, and in five days Holland fell,”Audrey remembered. “The occupation—that’s such a small word to cover theeternity of every day after the Germans came to our country, looted it, andstayed on to make slaves of us.” For the present, Audrey’s family waspermitted to remain in the ancestral home; word had come down from Naziheadquarters that an occupation achieved with citizens’ cooperation wouldfacilitate a total German conquest of the Low Countries.

Over the next ten months, the van Heemstra bank accounts, securities andpersonal jewelry were confiscated. Secure in their wealth for centuries, theynow saw almost everything taken away.

The German occupiers were eager to rouse anti-English sentiment—aprejudice that took such extreme forms as banning the import of biscuits andpreserves from Britain. For Ella and her family, this raised a major concern:Audrey Ruston was a British citizen with a British name and was fluent inEnglish—a combination that might easily subject her to arrest and evendeportation. Her daughter would have to learn the Dutch language and passfor Dutch. With remarkable shrewdness, Ella enrolled her daughter in the

local school as Edda van Heemstra, not as Audrey Kathleen Ruston. Thenewly minted identity was successful for as long as the girl needed it (that is,for the duration of the war), and then it was promptly discarded.

“My real name was never Edda van Heemstra. That was a name I assumedin school, because my mother thought it wiser during the German occupation,as mine sounded too English.” Ella also cautioned Audrey not to speakEnglish in public, as German soldiers were everywhere.

“For eight formative years [1939 to 1947], I spoke Dutch. My mother isDutch, my father English, but I was born in Belgium. So I had heard Englishand Dutch inside our house and French outside.” Following that, she hadspoken only English at school in Kent, and then only Dutch in Holland.“There is no speech I can relax into when I’m tired, because my ear has neverbeen accustomed to one intonation. It’s because I have no mother tongue thatthe critics accuse me of curious speech.”

It was precisely these polyglot early years that accounted for her uniquevocal patterns—the elegantly clipped tones, the almost musical undulation ofher phrasing and the prolongation of internal vowels that characterized themature Audrey Hepburn’s spoken English. Her speech was wholly suigeneris, and it always defied comparison with any known dialect. No othervoice could be mistaken for hers.

DAILY LIFE IN Nazi-occupied Holland, from 1940 to 1945, began badly andbecame a living nightmare. There was an almost constant state of anxiety asaircraft flew low overhead. Was that a British airplane on a reconnaissancemission, or was it a German attack? Like their parents, children took cover incellars, closets and cupboards—and when they emerged unharmed, they werescarcely reassured, for the Nazis broadcast threats daily.

Strict rationing was soon applied. Because the Germans needed oil,gasoline, tires, coffee, tea and all textiles for their military, the population hadlimited access to them. Barges were requisitioned; bicycles, shoes and even

iron destined for church bells were commandeered. Under Nazi control,Dutch radio constantly advised people on how to economize—by reusing tealeaves several times, for example, and by encouraging families to crowd intoone room, the better to save fuel.

And so a country that had enjoyed an enviably high standard of living wassoon sinking into poverty and disease; as the war dragged on, very fewpeople were able to cling to property of any value, and tuberculosis struck thecitizens in epidemic numbers by 1943. During wartime winters, some citizens—who would never have considered such actions before the war—choppeddown trees in public parks for use as firewood and plundered abandonedhomes for whatever was marketable.

Before long, the rights of Dutch Jews were limited, Jewish teachers andprofessors were dismissed from their posts and Jewish students could nolonger attend schools. Doctors were forbidden to treat Jewish patients, whowere also turned away from hospitals. Jewish women married to Gentiles hadto endure forced sterilization. The deportation of Dutch Jews occurred in1942, a development that led to public denunciations from the RomanCatholic and Dutch Reformed churches. The first punishment for suchinsubordination was to deport Jews who had converted to Christianity, suchas the brilliant Jewish philosopher Edith Stein, who had become a Catholicand a Carmelite nun; she was executed at Auschwitz.

“Families with babies, little children being hauled into meat wagons,wooden vans with just a slat at the top, and all those faces staring out at you,”Audrey recalled later, listing snapshot-memories of those deported fromHolland to concentration camps. “I knew the cold clutch of human terror allthrough my early teens: I saw it, felt it, heard it—and it never goes away.You see, it wasn’t just a nightmare: I was there, and it all happened.”

In 1941, Ella’s older son, Alex, vanished. Fighting for the hapless Dutcharmy at the beginning of the war, he was captured when the forcessurrendered. Somehow, he escaped and went into hiding until the end of thewar. But at the time, Ella and Audrey had no idea what had become of him,and in their worst moments, they presumed Alex was dead. For days, Audrey

wept inconsolably, asking again and again if all of them were to be sent toprison or condemned to death. “I didn’t know if I would just disappear as hadso many young girls and women, into the houses established for the‘entertainment’ of German officers and enlisted men. And I didn’t know if Iwould be taken for a week or a day, to help clean a building or serve at amilitary kitchen. All I knew was that I was twelve, and terrified.”

But as E. N. van Kleffens, then the Dutch minister of foreign affairs, wrotein 1940, “The Dutch have a gift of shrewd perspicacity which no propagandacan obliterate, [and] outward resignation should not be taken for inwardsubmission” to the Nazis. Precisely this spirit was evident in the remarkablestory of the spirited and heroic members of the Dutch resistance to theGerman invasion. The resistance was first concerned with maintaining calmuntil the end of the war. Later, when it was clear that the restoration of peacewas not a proximate reality, the Council of Resistance in the Kingdom of theNetherlands was founded, and its members were armed.

A robust eighteen-year-old in 1942, Ella’s younger son Ian was an earlyand intrepid member of the resistance during his student days in Utrecht. Hebegan his anti-German efforts by distributing pamphlets that encouraged hiscountrymen and were therefore subversive to the demoralizing tactics of theoccupiers. He then worked in secret with the so-called Radio Orangenetwork, which from time to time broadcast a quarter-hour speech by QueenWilhelmina from London; she promoted the Dutch people’s identificationwith the Allies.

Ian was also remarkable for organizing student strikes in Delft and Leidenwhen Jewish professors were dismissed—and he helped obtain falseidentification papers and food coupons for some Jews who would otherwisehave been loaded into boxcars heading for German concentration camps.Despite death threats from the Nazis, resistance workers urged labor strikesamong Dutch railway personnel, so that the arrival of German matériel wasinterrupted whenever possible. And when the battle lines came to Holland,the resistance evoked heroic exploits from ordinary Dutch citizens, whoassisted Allied solders during parachute landings, providing both first aid andhideaways for the wounded.

Unfortunately, Ian’s increasingly bold activities were discovered by theGermans. He was stopped one day in Arnhem and immediately deported toGermany, where he was one of four hundred thousand Dutchmen put toforced labor in munitions factories until the war was over. His whereabouts,too, were unknown to the family until his return in 1945.

Around the same time (June 1942), Audrey and her family experiencedfirsthand the savagery of the Nazi regime.

The Dutch Underground had attempted to demolish a German trainbringing military supplies into Holland, and reprisals were enacted at once inArnhem. Audrey’s beloved uncle, the judge; her cousin, an adjutant at court;another cousin; and four neighbors were all rounded up. The scene wasforever burned into the memory of thirteen-year-old Audrey:

“Don’t discount anything you hear or read about the Nazis. It was worsethan you could ever imagine. We saw my relatives put against the wall andshot.” With that, and to her everlasting credit, the Baroness Ella vanHeemstra began to work actively with the Dutch resistance, even to the pointof hiding Underground workers in their home.

IN 1941, HER MOTHER supplemented Audrey’s Dutch lessons with enrollment inafternoon music and dance classes at the Arnhem Conservatory, whichwaived most fees during the occupation and asked only what parents couldmanage to pay. “Once I started [dance lessons] in Holland,” she said yearslater, “all I wanted was to be a ballerina.” In November and December thatyear, at the Arnhem Stadsschouwburg, or city theater, there were programsmarking the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Mozart’s death. OnNovember 11, Ella directed a set of levende tafeleren, or tableaux vivants,with five players seated silently and motionless in full eighteenth-centurycostume—Audrey among them—while the Arnhem String Quartet playedselections from Mozart.

But Audrey preferred more active performances, and soon she had her

chance. At the Conservatory, she demonstrated such talent and dedicationthat she was chosen to study under Winja Marova, whose star pupil shequickly became. Soon Audrey was not only performing at school: she and afew other students were risking their safety by presenting private dancerecitals to collect money for resistance workers. These were called “blackperformances,” for they had to be offered with blackout curtains and littlelighting.

“I designed the dances myself,” Audrey recalled. “I had a friend whoplayed the piano, and my mother made the costumes. They were veryamateurish attempts—but when there was very little entertainment, it amusedpeople and gave them an opportunity to spend an afternoon or eveninglistening to music. The recitals were given in houses with windows and doorsclosed, and no one outside knew what was going on. Afterward, money wascollected and turned over to the Dutch Underground.” For fear of beingdiscovered, the little audiences could not applaud or in any way register theirapproval. “The best audience I ever had made not a single sound at the end ofmy performance.” From scraps of felt, Ella herself made Audrey’s balletslippers: “They didn’t give the support that ballet shoes did, but they satisfiedmy eager young toes.”

Often at these events, some people came up to Audrey and the other youngperformers and, along with some small sums, gave them pieces of foldedpaper—messages to be stuffed into the children’s shoes and transported thenext day to resistance workers. By prearrangement, the apparentlyuninvolved girls and boys would then meet their defiant countrymen (on acrowded streetcar, for example, or along a pathway in a park) and covertlypass on important information and some cash to support the cause.

There was nothing romantic, exciting or self-important about thesemissions, despite their superficial resemblance to stereotypical scenes from aHollywood thriller. Real danger was as ubiquitous as Nazi soldiers andpolicemen, and the children who dared defy the occupiers knew that they hadno chance of survival if caught. But her ballet lessons contributed toAudrey’s sense of discipline and her ability to ignore her own discomfort.She needed the same self-control when food rationing became so severe that

meat, eggs, tea and coffee were not available by any means. By the end of1942, fuel was so scarce that only one room per home was allowed to beheated. “But there is probably nothing in the world as determined as a childwith a dream,” Audrey said fifteen years later, “and I wanted to dance morethan I feared the Germans.” Although she never said so, she was just as mucha fervent operative on behalf of the Dutch resistance as she was an apprenticeballerina. Later, she did not consider that she often acted heroically: “It wasquite ordinary for Dutch children to risk death to save the lives of resistanceworkers.”

One winter day in Arnhem, a small platoon of German soldiers, riflesslung over their shoulders, ordered all the girls and women within their sightinto a line. They were then herded into three military trucks that bumped andlurched through the city streets, their passengers mute with terror. “The onlything I remember for certain is that, over and over and over, I kept saying tomyself in Dutch, ‘Our Father Who art in heaven…Our Father Who art inheaven…’”

The convoy abruptly stopped. The soldiers jumped out and began abusingsome Jews, recognizable by the mandatory yellow star on their clothing. “Iremember hearing the dull sound of a rifle butt hitting a man’s face. And Ijumped down, dropped to my knees and rolled under the truck. I thenskittered out, hoping the driver would not notice me—and he didn’t.”

Another time, a resistance worker told Audrey that, unknown to theGermans, an English paratrooper was hiding in the Arnhem forest. But hecould not remain there for long, since the Germans were about to take overthe woods on maneuvering exercises. The Englishman had to be warned—and helped to find friends and shelter. Would the English-speaking Audreybe willing to approach the paratrooper with instructions from the resistance—and then report to the resistance collaborator in the village who wouldprovide a hideaway?

She volunteered at once and entered the forest, calmly and innocentlypicking wildflowers as she went—a ruse in case she was stopped suddenly bya German soldier. Audrey found the paratrooper just where she was told,

gave him the information, answered his questions and headed back for thevillage. As she did so, she was met by two of the enemy, who addressed herin German, pointing to the path from which she had emerged and asking thereason for her presence in the area. Acting as if she had no idea what theywanted, she smiled brightly and handed them the bunch of flowers. ToAudrey’s astonishment, the soldiers accepted the bouquet, patted her shoulderand sent her on her way.

An hour later, she located a particular street-sweeper, and as he glancedtoward her, she nodded almost imperceptibly: that was the signal, and thesweeper–resistance worker knew that he might expect to be approached by afriendly English-speaker that evening. Audrey had fulfilled her task.

AS AUTUMN 1944 approached, one of the most daring exploits of the war waslaunched by Allied forces. Operation Market Garden, as it was called, was abold attempt by British and American airborne and ground troops to captureand control eight Dutch bridges and thus open a route for their advance intoGermany.

General Bernard Montgomery, commander of British forces in Europe,conceived the plan, which was endorsed by America’s General Dwight D.Eisenhower. Following the liberation of Paris on August 25 and of Brusselson September 4, an Allied victory seemed closer than ever. Operation MarketGarden, it was anticipated, would secure just that. Thirty-two thousandairborne troops were to be flown behind enemy lines to break the Germandefenses; by gliders and parachutes, one British and two American divisionswould drop near the Dutch towns of Eindhoven, Nijmegen and, mostimportant, Arnhem (the “Market” element), and by taking the bridges, theforces would create a path straight through to Germany (the “Garden”).

Two heavily armed SS Panzer divisions were stationed around Arnhem— 一nevertheless, the Allies went ahead with their plan. But the Allies had too fewplanes to deliver all the airborne troops in one mission, and so the drop wouldbe spread over three days. And because of German antiaircraft defenses near

the center of Arnhem, it was decided to drop the troops almost ten kilometersaway, which dissipated any element of surprise that might have weakened theGerman response.

The operation was launched on Sunday, September 17—a bright andcloudless day in the Dutch countryside. Allied soldiers were flush withexcitement and optimism as 1,500 planes and 500 gliders flew toward enemylines. The first drop—16,500 paratroopers and 3,500 glider troops—wascompleted with astonishing accuracy. But as the British approachedEindhoven, they quickly came under violent attack. The American airbornedivisions reached their targets in Nijmegen, but most of the bridges therewere blown up by the Germans before they could be captured. By the timethe Allies headed for Arnhem, German tanks had moved in, destroying muchof the city and ordering the entire population to evacuate within hours.

The situation quickly became desperate for the Allies, as British MajorTony Hibbert recalled:

“We really had nothing we could do to them [the Germans], and theydrove up and down the street, firing high explosives into the sides ofbuildings, then firing smoke shells through that. The phosphorus from thesmoke shells burned us out. By eight o’clock on Wednesday evening(September 20), the fires got out of control.”

German artillery quickly controlled the area, and thousands of Alliedsoldiers died and almost seven thousand were captured—many of them badlywounded. The largest airborne operation of World War II was thus also thecostliest—in fact, it was a dismal failure. Victory was no longer within sight;the war dragged on, taking the lives of thousands more civilians andservicemen.

According to the British military chronicler Richard Holmes, “Veteransand historians alike agree on the extraordinary kindness of the Dutchpopulation, so many of whose members helped the Allies at the risk, and sooften at the cost, of their own lives.” But for Dutch families, at first sohopeful of their liberation, there was worse misery to come. Arnhem and the

surrounding areas were in ruins, more than 450 civilians died in one day andthe Nazis put the rest of the populace to flight. As an early winter fell overHolland, German soldiers looted almost everything.

That winter was one of the coldest in European history, and the Naziscalmly watched the Dutch people starve to death as all available food wasdiverted to German soldiers.

“After the battle of Arnhem, the Germans ordered the city to beevacuated,” Audrey remembered. “We were among the ninety thousandpeople forced to leave, and my mother and I went to my grandfather’scountry house in Velp. But it was no holiday. We went for days at a timewithout anything to eat, and we sat and shivered in a house without heat orlight…We lived in a vacuum—no life, no news, no books, no soap. Yet all ofthat was nothing by comparison with the day-to-day horror…For a long time,we had nothing to eat but tulip bulbs.

“An endless stream of evacuees, thrown out of the city by the Nazis, cameto our door begging for food and shelter. It was human misery at its worst—masses of refugees on the move, hundreds collapsing from starvation. Wetook in forty people for a while, but there was literally nothing to eat, and sothey had to move on.

“Then, on the morning of December 24, my mother’s widowed sister toldus there wasn’t a scrap of food left. I had heard that one could forget hungerby sleeping. Perhaps, then, I could sleep through Christmas—I would try—but first there were the stairs to my room. I tried, but I couldn’t make it—Iwas too weak. My legs had begun to swell from edema, I was dangerouslymalnourished, and I was turning a frightful color from jaundice—my motheractually feared I would die from hepatitis.” Audrey’s weight had dropped toninety pounds, which was insufficient for her five-foot-seven-inch height.“Then there was a knock at the door. A man came from the DutchUnderground, with some tinned food for us. We found out later that boxes offood were left at each house from which hostages had once been taken to beshot.”

When that ration was gone, they were desperate. “We kept going with oneslice of bread a day per person, made from grass, and with a cup of waterybroth made from one potato…If you went on, you might live—and if youlived, you weren’t dead…We lost everything, of course—our houses, ourpossessions, our money. But we didn’t give a hoot. If we got through withour lives, that was the only thing that mattered.”

For months before the disaster in Arnhem, Audrey had been too frail andill to attend ballet classes; nor could she continue her task of giving dancelessons to a few younger girls at the Conservatory—which brought at least afew coins to her needy family. Her last appearance at Arnhem’s municipaltheater gained Audrey her first review; as a magazine critic noted: “Sheseems obsessed by a real dance rage and already has a respectable technicalproficiency.” But that was before her health collapsed.

On May 4, 1945, Audrey’s sixteenth birthday, she heard a shuffling soundoutside the cellar rooms at Velp. “I ran to the window and saw the firstcontingent of English soldiers. Freedom has a special smell to me—the smellof English petrol and English cigarettes. When I ran out to welcome thesoldiers, I inhaled their petrol as if it were a priceless perfume and Idemanded a cigarette, even though it made me choke.” She also asked forchocolate, and a kindly soldier, seeing her jaundice and swollen feet, gave herfive bars of it; she devoured them at once and was of course violently ill. ButAudrey never again lost her appetite for tobacco or chocolate candy.

Before month’s end, Alex emerged from hiding, and soon after, Ianreturned from Berlin, having walked almost the entire way. But there were noresources for a family celebration; there was only the deeply felt silence ofgratitude. For perhaps the only time in her life, Audrey saw tears on the faceof her mother.

In June, international aid slowly began to arrive, and the people of Arnhemand Velp were among the first recipients. The United Nations Relief andRehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) brought cartons of food, powderedmilk, instant coffee, blankets and basic medical supplies. “All the schoolswere turned into relief centers,” Audrey recalled later. “I was one of the

beneficiaries.” Audrey joined the entire van Heemstra family in thedistribution. “It was that wonderful old-fashioned idea, that others come firstand you come second. This was the whole ethic by which I was brought up.Others matter more than you do, so [as her mother said] ‘Don’t fuss, dear—just get on with it.’” Soon after, UNRRA became UNICEF, the UnitedNations Children’s Fund.

BUT WHERE WOULD they live? The answer came through a radio plea fromQueen Wilhelmina, who had returned to the Netherlands on the eve ofliberation and at once asked for volunteers to staff nursing homes forwounded veterans. One in every fifty Dutch citizens was killed or died duringthe war, and there were countless maimed or ill. Before the end of thatsummer, Audrey and her mother had decamped to two rooms of a clinic inAmsterdam, where they undertook every kind of routine duty—not onlyattending to the physical needs of the battered but also reading to them andwriting letters for them.

One of Audrey’s patients was a bedridden thirty-year-old Britishparatrooper named Terence Young, who had participated in the Battle ofArnhem. After his recovery a year later, he and several of his formercomrades in arms returned to Arnhem, where they made a film about theevents of September 1944. The result, Men of Arnhem, was partdocumentary, part dramatic recreation and the first of many films directed byYoung.

Audrey and Ella completed their nursing duties in early 1946. At once,Ella took a job as a cook to pay for their rent in a small Amsterdam apartmentand to underwrite Audrey’s return to the ballet classroom. Her teacher wasthe great pioneer Sonia Gaskell, who had studied and worked with Diaghilevand would later form the Netherlands National Ballet. Gaskell admired hernew student’s vitality, charm and ambition, but she was alarmed at the effectsof the war on Audrey’s slender form: the girl’s lack of energy and her poormuscle tone did not augur well for a career. Nor did her age: careers in balletordinarily begin when the student is much younger than seventeen.

THAT SUMMER, the long chain of difficulties in Audrey’s life finally overtookher, and she suffered the first in a lifelong series of profound emotionaldepressions. The manifestations were classic: apart from a few hours of classeach day, she slept constantly; she was melancholy and taciturn; and shebegan to overeat.

Since Audrey was six, she had endured an astonishing array of challenges.Abandoned by her father, she then had to accustom herself to lonelinessabroad at school; trained by her mother never to complain, she put a braveface on everything, so constant was her desire to be loved and accepted.Although she relished it, ballet gave her more to be disciplined about, andinto her exercises she poured all the ambition and dedication a sensitive girlcan muster. But artistic apprenticeship, however rewarding at the moment,has an uncertain future, and her teachers were too honest to promise anythingto anyone.

Fear had been her constant companion, and since 1940, the progressivedeprivation of life’s necessities had very nearly ruined her health forever. Atthe same time, the war had an odd but widespread corollary: like manyothers, Audrey found solidarity of purpose in working with her family andfriends for the resistance. Everyone underwent the same tribulations;everyone was carried along by the same stubborn hope. And there had at lastbeen an end to that long night of suffering. Her brothers had come home, aidhad come from the Allies and she and her mother found something valuableto do in attending the injured.

Now everything had changed. Alex and Ian were off pursuing their ownlives and careers. The tense drama of daily survival, which heightens andpinpoints life itself and renders meaningless so much that is less, gave way tothe quotidian reality of remaking one’s own world. Governments wereattempting the reconstruction of Europe, but Audrey had to renew, rediscoverand advance her own young life. No sense of teamwork or internationalprogram was there to help her. At seventeen, she was no longer a child butnot yet a mature woman. She had her mother’s courage for an example, but

there was no emotional component of affection in Audrey’s life.

As so often with people in crisis, Audrey directed her confusion towarddissatisfaction with herself, as she later confided: “I’ve often been depressedand deeply disappointed in myself. You can even say that I hated myself atcertain periods. I was too fat, or maybe too tall, or just plain too ugly. Icouldn’t seem to handle any of my problems or cope with people I met.” Justthen, on April 3, the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool reported anextraordinary discovery. “I read the diary of Anne Frank when it came out,”Audrey said years later, “and it just destroyed me. I identified so stronglywith this little girl, who was exactly my own age.”

In fact, it would have been remarkable if Audrey were not depressed in1946; it might even be alarming if we could say that she had sailed valiantlythrough every storm and had arrived calmly at the shores of young adulthood.Indeed, had she moved from episode to episode without feeling events deeplyand attempting to integrate those negative experiences into her subsequentlife, she would have been forever wounded—perhaps even psychologicallyblocked. Without the depression and the core of strength to move beyond it,she might have become a rather chilly woman with a loss of emotionalhealth. And she certainly would not have become a film actress who oftenconveyed uncommon interiority.

“I had gone through the war years deprived of food, money, books, musicand clothing,” she said of this time. “Now I began to overcompensate byeating everything in sight, particularly chocolates. I became as swollen andunattractive as a balloon.” Her self-assessment was more inflated than herbody, but by autumn, Audrey’s weight was 68 kilograms, or 150 pounds. Byno standard was she fat (as she later claimed); her face, neck, arms and uppertorso remained thin, but now there was more to her thighs and hips. If shereally intended a career in ballet, she would have to lose weight. Audrey soonachieved her goal of 110 pounds, which she maintained her entire life.

The reason for the successful and rapid weight reduction in late 1946 wassimple. Sonia Gaskell told Ella that Audrey might have a chance foradvanced study abroad with a famous colleague in London. If she intended to

be serious about dance, Ella said, weight loss was vital.

In London, they found a very different atmosphere from Folkestone in1939. Postwar England still suffered serious deprivations. For most people,the cessation of bombings removed the constant dread of sudden death butdid not otherwise improve the quality of life.

But the indomitable Ella van Heemstra was thoroughly dedicated to herdaughter’s career. She gamely took a job as concierge in a Mayfair apartmentbuilding, very close to Hyde Park and Grosvenor Square. There the titledlady, now forty-seven, could be seen putting out the trash and washing thestaircase at 65 South Audley Street. The modest building, just opposite theGrosvenor Chapel, was of red brick with marble pilasters; it had half a dozenflats and one room for the concierge and her daughter. Each morning, as Elladispatched her charwoman’s tasks, Audrey rushed past on her way to danceclass.

# Chapter Three

1947–1951

SONIA GASKELL’S CONTACT in London was none other than the brilliant,formidable Marie Rambert, then at the height of her influence in the world ofBritish classical dance. Born Cyvia Rambam in Warsaw in 1888, she hadcollaborated with Diaghilev, Nijinsky, Stravinsky and Isadora Duncan,among others. In 1920, she opened a London school that trained some of thegreat dancers and choreographers of the century—Frederick Ashton, AntonyTudor and Agnes de Mille, for example—and by 1936, her company andschool comprised Ballet Rambert. Worldwide recognition followed, and inearly 1947 she was fielding several offers for international tours.

Audrey arrived at Rambert’s newly rented but poorly heated rehearsalrooms in Cambridge Circus in early 1948, armed with a recommendationfrom Gaskell, her own prodigious energy and little else. Her weight was 110pounds, she stood five feet seven inches tall and had a twenty-inch waistline.At sixty, Madame Rambert weighed (so her students estimated) aboutseventy pounds and was just five feet tall. Everyone seemed impossibly bigto her, and she routinely invited others to sit opposite her, the better to avoidstraining her neck. Petite, feathery ballerinas were not merely easier for hermale dancers to partner: Madame found them more to her liking forinstruction and choreography, too.

Cultivated, dynamic, fluent in many languages and graced with animpeccable sense of theater, Rambert was inspiring as a mentor, but shecould also be indiscreet and even rude. Agnes de Mille, who had been astudent of Rambert in the 1930s, called her “Madame Wasp,” and studentsoften ran from her studio in tears. There was no doubt, however, that she

could evoke from good dancers an extraordinary range of styles andremarkable effects.

Stern but generous with young talent, Rambert watched Audrey’s briefaudition and listened to her describe her previous studies. She then toldAudrey to come back in the spring, when she expected to have the financialresources to offer a scholarship; at that time, there would also be a room forher at the home Rambert shared with her family in Kensington, whichinvariably housed a small flock of her impecunious dance students. At theseprospects, optimism crowded out Audrey’s depression. And at this point, shedropped the Ruston in her father’s surname but kept the Hepburn (her great-grandmother’s maiden name). Henceforth, she was known as AudreyHepburn.

But this was late January: what to do until April? The answer came in aletter from cousins in Amsterdam. Two of their friends, C. H. van der Lindenand H. M. Josephson, were hiring cast and crew for an independent short filmcomedy, and the men needed attractive young extras. There would be a fewdays’ employment if Audrey could return briefly to Holland. In February, shedid just that—not because movies held any interest for her, but because sheneeded the money over the next several months.

Despite its title, Nederlands in 7 lessen (Dutch in 7 Lessons) was not aneducational tool for learning a language. Audrey Hepburn’s first screenappearance, filmed in one day on a quiet street in Amsterdam, was, on thecontrary, a feeble little comedy about a movie cameraman who is assigned tomake a travelogue of the Netherlands but is more interested in pursuing localyoung women. The scatterbrained narrative (“dull and conventional,”according to a British critic) relied heavily on documentary footage of thecity seen from aerial shots. In two scenes filmed on the ground, Audrey madeher movie debut—at the beginning, when the bumbling cinematographeraccidentally collides with her on a street corner; and at the finale, when(dressed as a KLM flight attendant) she waves goodbye to him. Her totalfootage was clocked at less than a minute; she was uncredited, and the fewreviews made no mention of her.

Returning to London, Audrey was, as she later said, “always short ofmoney, although I modeled and clerked and did all sorts of little odd jobs.”When her classes began with Rambert, Audrey continued to accept eveningwork as a secretary or a photographer’s model; she appeared, for example, inmagazine advertisements for soap and shampoo. Ella, meanwhile, workedvariously as a hotel clerk, a florist, a decorator and a nanny for wealthytourists; she and her daughter shared their incomes and frequently theirlodgings.

For much of 1948, Audrey was pitched into a demanding schedule of balletstudy by day and part-time employment in the evenings. “My first class wasat ten a.m. and my last at six p.m., so it was work, work, work all day andinto the night.” As for dance lessons, they became “the most completelyexhausting thing I have ever done,” and there was constant, sometimes nerve-wracking attendance to detail. If Madame caught her students “folding ourarms or slouching our shoulders, she’d give us a good rap across the knuckleswith a stick.” The new student may not have anticipated this antique form ofcorporal punishment, but she bore it because “my dream was to wear a tutuand dance at Covent Garden.”

Despite her keen ambition and estimable energy, Audrey’s dream remainedjust that. At the end of summer, Ballet Rambert was preparing to depart for afifteen-month tour of Australia and New Zealand, and Madame announcedher choice of dancers. Audrey asked why her name was not on the list, andher teacher explained the reasons: Audrey was too tall; she had begun serioustraining too late; she might be employed in the corps de ballet or as a chorinein musical theater, and Rambert thought she could have a fine career as aballet instructor—but Audrey would never be a prima ballerina.

“My technique,” she said a few years later, “didn’t compare with that ofthe girls who had had five years of Sadler’s Wells teaching, paid for by theirfamilies, and who had always had good food and bomb shelters. Reasonmade me see that I just couldn’t be so square as to go on studying ballet. Still,I thought it was way below my dignity to go into a musical.”

Whatever her momentary reaction to Madame Rambert’s pronouncement,

there was no time for melancholy. In October 1948, Audrey left the house inKensington, moved back with her mother and, with a few other students whohad been left out of the Rambert tour, made the rounds of producers’ andagents’ offices in search of theater work.

SHE WAS NOT unemployed for long, but the job was not to her taste. In lateOctober, auditions were announced for the London production of HighButton Shoes, a popular American musical comedy then in its second year onBroadway. With music and lyrics by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn andchoreography by Jerome Robbins, the show—a series of zany sketches abouta confidence man in the early part of the century—called for adancing/singing chorus of girls as bathing beauties, dashing about in fast andfunny dance numbers that recalled silent-film farces. Audrey was one of thelast of forty to be selected from three thousand candidates. She signed a one-page contract and received eight pounds weekly, then about thirty-twodollars.

“When I was chosen for High Button Shoes,” she remembered a few yearslater, “I didn’t know one syncopated beat from another, so I had to workmuch harder than the other girls.” Throughout the weeks of rehearsal, shestayed late to work with dance assistants, and she rose early to practice on herown before the next day’s call.

High Button Shoes opened at the Hippodrome on December 22, 1948, andhad a successful run of 291 performances. It was “one of the maddest piecesof hurly-burly dancing…that London has seen for a long time,” according tothe London Daily Telegraph, “and the high spot…is the ballet in the mannerof the early Mack Sennett films.” But this was only temporizing for Audrey;once again, no reviews mentioned her, and the show seemed to lead hernowhere. When it closed on May 5, 1949, she was invited to join its touringcompany—but the producer Cecil Landeau had spotted the third girl from theleft in the second row onstage and offered her a job in his new musical revue,set to open on May 18 at the Cambridge Theatre.

Still a chorine, she was to have walk-on bits with a line or two in some ofthe twenty-seven short sketches, and she would be one of only five dancers.Audrey knew that she was fortunate to be working at all during those difficulttimes. And work she did: her schedule of six evening and two matineeperformances allowed her to accept more modeling assignments for magazineand newspaper ads.

Landeau staged genial and entertaining shows, and Sauce Tartare was butthe latest and most successful assembly of those songs and satiric sketches sobeloved by English audiences. The cast was composed of talent from a dozencountries, among them the comedic South African singer Zoë Gail, whostopped the show with “A Hick in Piccadilly.” Tartare was reviewedpositively, although only one or two principal players were mentioned.Critics hailed the show’s freshness, wit and style; the accomplished cast(“Everyone in the company can do something and has the chance to do it”);and the inventive sets and costumes (“tropical forests, skyscrapers painted insepia, the South America of sheet music, mysterious lamp lit avenues in Paris—the exotic [is] all in far better taste than the exotic in fact ever is”).

Audrey portrayed something called a Boogie Woogie Yoga Follower inone sketch, a shopgirl in another and a classical dancer in a third. Accordingto a spectator who attended several times, she “stood out, with an eagerfreshness, a Peter Pan–like litheness to her dancing and a quality of alwaysbeing alive and alert, although the spotlight was invariably on someone else.”

Her colleagues in the show had mixed reactions to her. “We all noticedAudrey’s potential,” said Jessie Matthews, a renowned British musical star.“She had a lovely, indefinable quality, and when Cecil Landeau asked me totake her through some of my numbers, I was very happy to do so. She justhad to be a star, given the right breaks.”

Aud Johanssen, a Scandinavian dancer, was blunt: “I have the biggest titsonstage, but everyone looks at the girl who has none at all!” Fashionphotographer Anthony Beauchamp, who documented the production of SauceTartare, said that he had photographed stars like Vivien Leigh and GretaGarbo, but with Audrey he “had the feeling of making a true discovery when

I found her. She had such freshness and a kind of spiritual beauty.” That wasan estimation often repeated over the decades: many people claimed to have“discovered” Audrey, but it was actually Cecil Landeau (not Beauchamp)who first recognized her talent for theater and encouraged it.

Bob Monkhouse, later a famous comedian, was another performer withAudrey in both Sauce Tartare and its sequel; his recollection was of asomewhat controversial performer. “As far as the dancing was concerned,Audrey was on the lowest rank,” he recalled. “If she had been a good dancer,the other girls [in the show] wouldn’t have disliked her so much. You see,they liked her off stage but not on: they saw that if Audrey so much asjumped in place, the audience was captivated. Her appearance was soadorable that you held your breath while she smiled and batted her eyes.Later, she learned to do less of all this.” Her little antics may have been fromnervousness, or the desire to cover for what she perceived as awkwardnessand poor technique. “I felt I was really ugly compared to those other girls,”Audrey said later; what others regarded as scene-stealing may have beenmere compensation. In any case, audiences loved her and Cecil Landeaucould count on her for unexpected turns of comic vivacity.

However, the producer was anxious. He always reminded his casts thatrelations among them must remain strictly professional, that he wasmanaging an upright and proper company. But Audrey had quite obviouslyfallen in love with fellow player Marcel Le Bon. A handsome French singerand lyricist, Le Bon had the kind of casual Gallic charm that some womenfind irresistible, and he became Audrey Hepburn’s first suitor. Landeauhoped the affair would quickly run its course before the couple became anofficial item, stealing newspaper space and the attention of audiences for thewrong reasons and besmirching the good name of his organization.

Established and ascendant luminaries did not—at that time—trumpet thedetails of their personal lives to press and public. Promoters, producers,agents and managers worked zealously to envelop the trade in the best image,and so only the most generous, the most flattering, the most exemplaryimpressions were set forth. And the press, for the most part, collaborated,since the public (once upon a time) demanded that those in show business

lead blameless lives.

The making and unmaking of marriages among celebrities were noted, butthere was never any allusion to the personal lives of those not legally united.An unmarried couple was “dating” or “engaged”—with the inference ofpropriety, which meant chastity. Anything but traditional wedlock couldscarcely be mentioned in public without fear of legal action.

A consequence of this was a regrettable double standard of which Audreyhad to be aware. Men who had an adulterous relationship, serial affairs ormultiple mistresses, and even those who were almost pathologicallypromiscuous, were regarded as charming rakes and roués—or as puerilechaps in need of taming. A woman with a lover or two in her past or present,on the other hand, could be forever branded as an unprincipled tart. A youngwoman hoping to make a career—especially so public a career—had to beexceedingly vigilant for the way she was regarded. A woman of easy virtue,as it was once called, was not desirable.

In addition, Audrey had been raised and trained with a certain decorumabout sex—not prudery, but a kind of reserve or restraint. She neverrehearsed her private life and never confided her affairs to a journalist.Remarkably, she managed to sustain the image throughout her life, despiteher healthy sexual appetite and several more or less protracted romances.After two broken marriages, she finally lived quite openly with a man foralmost a dozen years: by that time, such was her persona and the standard ofa new era that she almost seemed to hallow the unmarried state.

This is not to suggest that Audrey Hepburn was deceitful or sanctimonious,much less that she simply inhabited gentility as if it were a role. Her publicdemeanor was never Victorian, her private manner never tainted with false orexpedient convention. She was apparently in all situations entirely herself,and that self—while not revealed to everyone—was neither inhibited norintemperate. It amused her to know that many regarded her as without desireor passion, just as some people wrongly believed that so slim a woman musthave had an eating disorder.

And so l’affaire Le Bon simmered pleasurably in 1949 and 1950. Sealedenvelopes were passed through discreet friends at the Cambridge Theatre;Audrey received flowers “from an anonymous admirer” backstage;sometimes she did not return home until the small hours (or not at all); andshe politely but insistently avoided the topic with her mother, who somehowlearned about Le Bon and was alarmed that Audrey might marry a cabaretsinger whose model was that Gallic boulevardier, Maurice Chevalier.

THERE WERE 433 performances of Sauce Tartare, which lasted for one year.During its Christmas season, Audrey supplemented her twelve-pound-a-weeksalary by also appearing in a play for children, which meant that she didtwenty-one shows a week for four weeks.

The success of Tartare inspired Landeau to extend his franchise and stagea sequel of sorts. He called it Sauce Piquante, an uneven blend of comicsketches and musical numbers that satirized the movies and plays of the time(“A Tramcar Called Culture,” for example, spoofed the prize-winningTennessee Williams play). In one scene, Audrey posed as the spirit ofchampagne, wearing gold lamé and the ears of a leprechaun, or were they apixie’s? Landeau also gave her a solo dance. The revue opened on April 27,1950, to less enthusiastic notices than its predecessor; it sank into oblivionafter eight weeks. By that time, however, the shrewd Landeau had gone onestep further, shuttling his favorite players over to the club known as Ciro’s,where he presented Summer Nights, an abbreviated version of SaucePiquante, twice more each evening after the cast had completed Piquante. “Iworked like an idiot!” Audrey recalled. Ciro’s was more intimate than atheater, and for the first time audiences could see her at closer range.

Landeau did not choose Marcel Le Bon for Ciro’s, and his strategyworked. With Audrey working until almost three in the morning, Le Bon’sattention turned elsewhere, and soon he was off to other adventures. Audreymay indeed have lamented his absence, but she was too busy to languish infond memories. One habit became more pronounced at this time, however:Audrey began to smoke more heavily, preferring Golden Flake cigarettes.

“Audrey communicated something in Sauce Piquante that served her wellall during her career,” according to Bob Monkhouse. “It was an impressionshe gave—‘I am alone and defenseless in the world, and I need you to saveme.’ Maybe without even knowing it, people seemed to react at once: ‘I’lltake this poor little creature under my wing.’” Monkhouse was neither mean-spirited nor critical: he merely identified an authentic part of AudreyHepburn’s character that was eventually emphasized by certain kinds of rolesand performances, by the way she stood or glanced or spoke, and by theappeal she made to her audience. She often did feel alone and defenseless inthe world—but not always. Her habit of getting on with it (as her motheralways urged) had created a core of strength, and from that core she drewreserves to battle the occasional fears and depressions that occurred likesudden summer squalls.

On different occasions, two spectators were particularly impressed withAudrey’s performance in Sauce Piquante. Writer and director ThoroldDickinson was planning to film an espionage thriller with an internationalcast. He went to meet her after a performance and promised her a screen testfor an important role that, he said, would put both her dance skills and heryouthful beauty to good use. But the project was not scheduled until later thatyear. In addition, moviemaker Mario Zampi thought Audrey would be anattractive addition to the opening sequence of a comedy to be filmed thatautumn.

Meanwhile, she continued to gain favorable publicity from modeling andfrom movie magazines. Her dignified sense of repose, her long legs and herslightly aloof (but not haughty) air were a fashion photographer’s dream, andfrom this time a favorable symbiosis occurred. On the one hand, her looksand her manner made Audrey the ideal fashion model; on the other, her workas a fashion model made her more conscious of clothes and eventuallycontributed significantly to her success as a movie actress. Now, the glossierperiodicals like Film Review and Picturegoer, which celebrated rising stars,or at least attractive newcomers whose face and figure sold copies, beganregularly to feature her on their covers.

AFTER THE VISITS from Dickinson and Zampi, Audrey correctly reasoned thatshe ought to know something about the art and craft of acting. With theircasual and improvisatory style, cabaret sketches and musical revues were onething. But the camera’s merciless close-ups would betray any haltingawkwardness or insecure hesitation: a performance on film had to appearnatural, even after multiple takes. Accepted as a drama student by FelixAylmer, Audrey undertook her first serious study since she began to dance.“He taught me to concentrate intelligently on what I was doing,” Audrey saidlater.

Aylmer, born in 1889, had one of the longest careers in British theater andfilm. A renowned interpreter of Shakespeare and Shaw, he also excelled inmodern plays and popular movies; and he was a dedicated mentor to youngtalent. “What’s most important is poise and motion,” according to Aylmer.“She had that naturally.” Audrey’s sessions with Aylmer and several of hisother students continued for several months: they read and discussed scenesfrom classic and modern plays, she learned how to project her normally quietvoice, and she practiced proper stress within lines of dialogue.

His professional connections enabled Aylmer to send likely candidates toread for movie roles, and during the early summer of 1950, Audrey wascostumed and screen-tested for the Hollywood religious epic Quo Vadis. “Forthree months, we tested hundreds of girls,” said director Mervyn LeRoy,recalling the casting of Lygia, a Christian heroine in that story. “In London, Ithought I had found her when we tested a young actress named AudreyHepburn. I thought she was sensational, but the studio [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer] took one look at the test and turned her down. Eventually, we decidedwe couldn’t use an unknown after all.” The role went to Deborah Kerr.

At about the same time, Audrey had the good luck to meet Robert Lennard,casting director at Associated British Pictures Corporation (ABPC), whichthen co-owned Elstree Studios. Despite all the claims and counterclaims as towho facilitated Audrey’s entrance into films, it was Robert Lennard to whomthe credit must be assigned. His efforts were not without difficulty, for

although she was only twenty-one, Audrey was hesitant to bind herself to astudio and thus, she thought, restrict her opportunities.

ABPC, a company founded by John Maxwell in 1927, was bankrupt at thetime of his death. By 1950, the rescuing co-owner of the company—andeffectively the power behind it—was none other than Jack Warner, of WarnerBros. This co-ownership gave Warner major influence over the entire ABPCcombine, including its Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, its worldwidedistribution deal through the British arm of Pathé and its circuit of ABCcinemas, then the largest movie theater chain in Britain.

At first reluctant to sign the studio contract Lennard proposed, Audrey atlast agreed to his offer of a three-picture deal with ABPC. She was to receive£500 for her first picture, with pay raises to £1,500 for her third. These sumsmust have seemed royal indeed to a performer who had received only £12 aweek for her most recent job and was now essentially unemployed.

Audrey’s first assignment for ABPC was not that company’s production atall. They sold her to an independent corporation for a minuscule role in awoefully tedious movie called One Wild Oat, in which she was seen for lessthan twenty seconds. In her moment of screen time, Audrey portrays a rathertoo stylishly outfitted hotel receptionist who takes a call from her marriedolder boyfriend (Stanley Holloway): “Good morning, Regency Hotel…Who?…Mr. Gilbey?…Oh, hello, Alfred!” And before you know it, Audreyhas vanished from the movie; that it was never released outside England didno harm to her career. Still, during her one day of work at Elstree Studios, inHertfordshire, she made an impression on Holloway, who pointed her out toco-star Robertson Hare: “There’s a girl who seems to me to have what ittakes to get on in pictures.”

After that, Mario Zampi was ready for Audrey in his film Laughter inParadise. After the opening credits for the established actors, ABCP thentrumpeted her first film for them (and that of another new contract player):“And Introducing Veronica Hurst and Audrey Hepburn.” Audrey’s bit part, acigarette girl in a nightclub, required little more than a few moments ofrehearsal and shooting. Then, in the Alec Guinness comedy The Lavender

Hill Mob (for which she was again loaned out, this time to Ealing Studios),Audrey played a girl named Chiquita, apparently a paramour of the Guinnesscharacter. “Oh, you are sweet—thank you!” she purrs, accepting a handful ofcash from him and wandering elegantly off among the crowd at a SouthAmerican restaurant.

Audrey’s inchoate career in ballet, such as it had been, was finished, andnow her future in films was doubtful. She was making movies only to pay herbills and to contribute to the support of Ella, who was temporarilyunemployed that year. More to the point, there was very little else in her lifeat this time—not even the choice of the films in which she would appear. “Ifyou add them all up,” she said later of the six pictures in which she appearedduring 1950 and 1951, “they made [a total of] one quick appearance.” But apaycheck was better than none, and so, hopeful for better roles, she renewedher contract with ABPC for three more films, with remuneration escalating to£2,500. A secondary clause gave the company the right to use her in onepicture a year thereafter.

Although Audrey had seven scenes in her next picture, she hated every dayof work on it. Young Wives’ Tale was to be a witty and slightly risqué farceabout people forced to share lodgings during the postwar housing shortage inEngland. Added to the community of young married couples is a single,professional typist (Audrey), a pretty but obviously neurotic womanconvinced that every man is out to do her harm. She thinks that a pedestrianis a mad stalker and that a diner at a restaurant is a potential attacker—not thebest plot idea for a comedy.

Nor was the director, Henry Cass, much help: he found fault witheverything Audrey did. His major complaint was her absurdly exaggerated,faux-upper-class English accent, which bore no resemblance to her normalspeech and sounded merely affected instead of amusing. The other players inthis Tale were established stage and screen actors—among them JoanGreenwood, Guy Middleton, Athene Seyler and Irene Handl—and they spokein a similarly idiosyncratic manner, mostly for comic effect, which was afairly common, if curious, tradition in some British comedies of the period.Cass said nothing to them.

“He had it in for me,” Audrey recalled. “It was the only unhappyexperience I ever had making a picture.” Cast members came to her defensewhen they could, but the atmosphere on the set remained tense anduncongenial—rather like the finished picture. One American critic tookfavorable if brief notice: the players tried hard, wrote Bosley Crowther in TheNew York Times, “including that pretty Audrey Hepburn as the unwedboarder.”

DURING PRODUCTION OF Young Wives’ Tale in November 1950, ThoroldDickinson was finally able to test Audrey for the part of Nora Brentano in hisforthcoming political thriller, Secret People (not, as it is usuallymisidentified, The Secret People). This was to be the most important part shehad undertaken so far, for it would provide an opportunity to work withestablished European stars and to dance in two ballet sequences. Weeksbefore filming began, however, she learned that there might be a problem:because neither of the two leading players was tall, “the rest of the cast mustbe scaled to them,” as production notes indicated. “This of course appliesparticularly to Nora—a slight discouragement to Audrey Hepburn.” As lateas the end of 1950, just when Young Wives’ Tale was concluding, Audrey’sparticipation in Secret People was uncertain.

On the morning of February 23, 1951, a professional dancer auditioned forthe role—the eleventh candidate to be seriously considered. Then, thatafternoon, the director ushered in “our first choice, Audrey Hepburn,” as theproduction notes document. “After the first run-through, people start eyeingeach other meaningfully; she has the quality, all right. After anotherrehearsal, it seems almost a waste of time to shoot the test.” Audrey won thepart of Nora.

The film was planned as a serious drama with a political-moral subtext inthe tradition of Joseph Conrad and Graham Greene. The story concerns twoyoung sisters, Maria and Nora Brentano, who flee to London from anunnamed central-European dictatorship when their father is killed by a

dictator. As adults, played by Audrey Hepburn and Valentina Cortese,*1  theyare drawn into various aspects of an assassination plot against their father’skiller—but the attempt misfires, and an innocent waitress is killed when abomb is planted at a dance recital. Maria (Cortese), who had been pressedinto collaboration by her lover (Serge Reggiani), is accused and arrested, butthe police know she will be a valuable informer. Her identity is changed, sheundergoes plastic surgery, and Nora believes her dead. The sisters are finallyreunited, but there is a tragic finale.

That year in Secret People, “the quality” was seen for the first time onfilm, and it was in fact an amalgam of traits and talents rooted in Hepburn’singenuousness, her directness, her credible and unstudied artlessness. Sheseemed to have “an endless fund of vitality to expend,” as the productionnotes added (especially in the sequence for the ballet performance, filmed onMarch 19, 1951), and an ability to convey grief or shock, dismay orapprehension, anxiety or astonishment precisely by underplaying thoseemotions—by just a slight turn of the head when that was right; by a slightopening of the mouth and an enigmatic darkening of her glance when thatwas natural; by a moment’s hesitation that made listeners believe she was notreciting a line of dialogue but coming upon the unexpected depths andchallenges of life.

Her technique, in other words, was a complete lack of technique, and sothe feelings of her characters were not something deliberated, labored orcontrived. We cannot know if or how much Audrey thought of her ownwartime past in Arnhem during the scene in which a bomb explodes whileshe is dancing. That sequence took several days, many retakes and somearduous camera setups, and there were numerous attempts to find the rightsound for the studio bombing; it was not a pleasant time for her.

But whatever cloud of memories may momentarily have returned, Audreywas not overcome by them. She seemed to know instinctively how subtlegradations of feeling had to be communicated for the camera. None of herdirectors had thus far donated more than a moment or two of explanationabout eye-line or key lighting; before Dickinson, she had more than a line ofdialogue only in the picture directed by Henry Cass. Now, Dickinson found

that indeed he had to tell her very little. “The quality” was there at once. Heand his cameraman had only to capture it.

Working with gifted and seasoned veterans like Serge Reggiani (thenappearing in his twenty-first film) and Valentina Cortese (in her thirty-second) made the production of Secret People especially gratifying forAudrey because she learned so much from them—that publicity must bealways subordinated to the limits of professionalism, for example. When aninterviewer visiting the set referred to acting as Reggiani’s life, he replied,“No, it’s my job.” Always happy to answer questions (but not to initiatediscussion) about his work, he politely but firmly refused to discuss hispersonal life or his family. This impressed Audrey.

Cortese, with some experience of Hollywood behind her, was even moreemphatic: “If an actress is popular…people want to know about her, to feelthey know her. And sometimes that can be very touching. But we must beallowed to have our own lives. In Hollywood, it is terrible—they expect youto be their slave; you have to be ready to do anything for them, at any time,not just when you’re making a picture.” And then Cortese turned to Audrey:“Think hard before you sign a long-term contract, dear. Liberty is the mostwonderful thing of all.”

The problem, and Audrey knew it, was that she had to decide what sort ofpublicity was necessary and what was not—what to say and what towithhold. If she gave too many interviews, she knew, the public would “getsick of [me]. I’d much rather wait until I have something to show, instead ofrisking a tremendous anti-climax when people finally do start seeing the firstlittle bits I’ve done in films.” This was highly problematic, of course: hercontract for ABPC stipulated—the very week after this little publicityseminar with Reggiani and Cortese—that Audrey had to be photographedfeeding ducks on the South Downs and paddling in a village pond, all for thebenefit of Illustrated magazine.

Without question, Secret People was Audrey’s most important film so far,and the critics in Britain and America said so. “Audrey Hepburn combinesbeauty with skill, shining particularly in two short dance sequences,”

according to a typical notice.

THAT SEASON THERE were the usual parties to which stars, directors,producers, contract players and those anointed for celebrity were invited—infact, studio moguls commanded them to attend. Often hosted by those withfinancial stakes in the British film industry, these events were held infashionable Mayfair or Belgravia reception rooms, in posh clubs and even inconsular chambers. At such events, business chatter could be heard alongwith the gossip of the day—and sometimes the rituals of courtship andseduction, too.

Early one evening during the spring of 1951, Audrey attended a cocktailparty sponsored by ABPC, where she was introduced to a man of ferociouscharm, not to say considerable sex appeal. At six foot four, with wavy, darkblond hair and a two-hundred-watt smile, James Hanson could not gounnoticed at any gathering. Then twenty-eight, he was seven years older thanAudrey and heir to an enormous family fortune made in long-distancetrucking—first in England, then in Canada; eventually, oil and shipping wereadded to the family interests. By the time Hanson met Hepburn, his net worthwas in the tens of millions of pounds sterling. But as it was later noted, in theearly 1950s he was “more interested in being a playboy than a businessman.”

James Hanson had no professional connection to the world of movie stars,but in that firmament he had a definite personal interest. An industriouspartygoer and a diligent pursuer of attractive women, he counted among hisgirlfriends Ava Gardner, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins. In 1951, he addedAudrey Hepburn’s name to his list of favorites. Very soon, this became aserious love affair that could not be kept from the press. As for the baroness,she heartily approved of the match and confidently predicted an auspiciousunion that would provide her daughter with stability and security.

1951

“WITLESS…FRENETIC…CONTRIVED… pointless.”

These were some of the gentler terms used by critics to describe AudreyHepburn’s seventh film; happily, she was not mentioned in reviews.

Producer and band director Ray Ventura had borrowed her from ABPC tojoin the cast of a comedy with music called Monte Carlo Baby, filmedhurriedly on the Riviera in the spring of 1951. Actually, there were two filmsof the story made on the spot: immediately after each scene was shot inEnglish, it was repeated in French. In the latter version (released as Nousirons à Monte Carlo), because of her fine command of the language, Audreywas the only player to repeat her role. Both films were dismal failures, for theweak narrative was merely a pretext for Ventura’s musical numbers. In a fewpoorly written scenes, Audrey played a famous actress whose toddler ismistakenly given to a traveling musician; farcical excursions ensue before theobligatory happy finale. She was not the leading lady: that doubtfuldistinction went to Michele Farmer, Gloria Swanson’s daughter, whose firstand last performances were in Monte Carlo Baby. With two directors, twosets of colleagues and two scripts, Audrey was kept busy, but not happily so.

For one thing, she missed James Hanson. For another, she had not wantedto do the picture, for she feared that if she left London for this meagerassignment, she might miss better opportunities at home. She discussed thematter with Valentina Cortese, who advised that Audrey should indeed go toMonaco—who knew what good contacts were to be made in that warm andsunny spot?

As if on cue, things happened quickly. And the catalyzing event for thedramatic shift in her life and career was almost fanciful, with just the righttouch of serendipitous whimsy.

One afternoon in May, the Monte Carlo Baby company was filmingoutside the sumptuous Hôtel de Paris. Audrey was gamely leaping about,appearing in a silly sequence that was, as usual, being twice directed, twiceshot. As the filming continued, an elderly woman in a wheelchair, with acrown of frizzy hair, was returning to the hotel from the seaside. She raisedan imperious hand, a signal to the man who was carefully guiding hercontraption through the small gathering. He bent over in attendance, shewhispered to him, they glanced toward the scene, and then the old lady wasrolled majestically onward, into the hotel lobby.

The eccentric figure in the wheelchair was none other than the popular anddistinguished French writer Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who used only hersurname; her caregiver was her husband, Maurice Goudeket. For her highlysensual and often controversial short stories and novels, Colette drew quitedirectly on her own lively and checkered history—three times a wife; aprodigious lover of men and women; a former actress, a sometime poet, oncea painter, always a rebel and a relentless critic of social hypocrisies.

In May 1951, Colette was seventy-eight years old and permanentlyconfined to her wheelchair or her bed, virtually immobilized with arthritisand requiring constant assistance. But her mind was as agile as ever, herperceptions clear and her eyesight unimpaired. Celebrated as a bemusedrealist who punctured moralistic stereotypes and constantly askeddisconcerting questions about the role of women in society, she kept onadding to her long list of popular achievements even in advanced age. Hernovella Gigi had been published in 1945 and was transformed into a Frenchfilm three years later. (An American musical movie version would follow in1958, and a Broadway version of that in 1973.) Now, in 1951, the Americannovelist, playwright and screenwriter Anita Loos was completing her stageadaptation of Gigi and had mildly piqued the interest of the producer GilbertMiller. At the same time, Miller got George Cukor to sign on as director; thiswould mark his return to Broadway after almost a quarter century in

# Hollywood.

Miller always insisted that he had been zealously committed to producing aplay of Gigi since its publication as a book. When he learned that Loos wasworking on a dramatization, he was, so he later claimed, “delighted and toldher as much. A week later we agreed on its production and I flew to Spain onvacation.”

The reality was not quite as Miller recorded.

In fact, the general manager of his production company, the clever MortonGottlieb, had initiated conversations about Gigi with Anita Loos and hadunilaterally and publicly announced it during one of Miller’s many absencesfrom New York. As Loos recalled, Miller was a man who much preferred“losing himself in the pursuits of a Park Avenue playboy, [and so he] turnedthe job of producing the play over to Mortie. But the production had hit onesnag…After auditioning all the ingénues on Broadway, [we] couldn’t find aGigi.” There was a concomitant problem: according to the terms of Colette’scontract, any actress who was to portray Gigi had to have her approval—justas she had the right to approve Loos’s adaptation.

Why she indeed authorized the Loos adaptation may forever remainobscure. Colette’s original two-hundred-and-fifty page novella was writtenwith her Gallic tongue firmly planted in her cheek. Gigi, a delightfuladolescent Parisian girl at the turn of the twentieth century, is being raised byher grandmother, aunt and mother to follow in their privileged footsteps andto become a fashionable courtesan—the mistress to a wealthy gentleman.This is considered to be the most expeditious route to an easy and luxuriouslife, and so the older women undertake to train her in all the arts necessary tosucceed. Gigi hates the idea, even when the gentleman in question ishandsome, loving and attentive. To the horror of her family, the man thendecides to marry Gigi, and she accepts his proposal.

From Colette’s novella, Anita Loos had fashioned a rather flat and literalEnglish adaptation of what is essentially a very French social satire: until theplay was finally staged, no one (apparently not even Colette) recognized that

the adaptation was a serious attenuation of the novella. Everything allusive inthe French had become candid in the English, everything subtle overstated.

PRECISELY WHEN ANITA LOOS, Morton Gottlieb and Gilbert Miller weretemporizing with the press and theater owners and abandoning hope offinding the right talent, Maurice Goudeket, on orders from his wife, sent atelegram to Miller:

DO NOT CAST YOUR GIGI UNTIL YOU READ MY LETTER.

The letter followed a few days later:

Colette and I have just seen a young English actress playing in a film nowbeing made in Monte Carlo. On seeing her, Colette said, “This would be avery good Gigi.” I should like you not to decide definitely on any Gigiwithout seeing her…I believe she has had little experience on the stage, [but]she is very pretty and has that piquant quality necessary for the part.

As it happened, Colette and Goudeket had invited Audrey to their suite thevery day they saw her at work, “and asked me if I would like to do the play. Isaid, ‘I can’t! I’ve never acted—I’m a dancer and have never spoken onstage!’ Colette said that as a hard-working dancer, I could do it.” Audrey reada few lines with the lady, but for most of their meeting, they discussed travel,food, music, romance. At the end of the evening, Colette handed her anautographed photo: “To Audrey Hepburn—the treasure I found on thebeach.”

On the morning of July 7, the treasure went by train from the Riviera toLondon’s Victoria Station and there transferred to the waiting arms of James

Hanson, who swept her off for a weekend in the country. The followingweek, she went to the Savoy Hotel to meet Gilbert Miller and Anita Loos,who had come from New York to consider her. “After a brief chat with MissHepburn, we named her for our Gigi,” was all Miller had to say. “She didn’tdo it very well, but Audrey was engaged,” according to Loos. Colette’sblessing had in fact won Audrey the role so many had sought.

“I started walking on a cloud,” Audrey said of that summer day, “a veryworried cloud…I tried to explain to all of them that I wasn’t ready to do alead, but they didn’t agree—and I was not going to try to change theirminds.”

Now Miller and company had a leading lady—but the delay had cost themCukor, who was by this time busy working on another film. The producersettled on the French stage director Raymond Rouleau, who spoke noEnglish. No problem there, said Miller: Audrey Hepburn spoke Frenchfluently, and Loos would translate her adaptation into French for Rouleau’sbenefit. For the moment, everyone was euphoric—even James Hanson,whose proposal of marriage Audrey accepted. They announced theengagement in September, and the marriage was to follow the followingJune. Neither of them saw any reason why their professional schedules couldnot be made congruent; in any case, Audrey longed to subordinate her workto marriage and children.

Gilbert Miller paid a few thousand pounds to ABPC in consideration ofAudrey’s time out of her studio contract. Otherwise, the men there weresomewhat diffident: after all, she was nothing like an English film star whoseabsence would mean a considerable loss to them. They reasoned that if Gigifailed, she would return to them eager to work; if it succeeded, she wouldreturn to them a star and would much improve their fortunes. And so, with acomprehensible blend of elation and anxiety, Audrey prepared to leave forAmerica as soon as possible.

But the best-laid plans had to be briefly postponed. One morning inSeptember, she took a call from Robert Lennard at Associated BritishPictures, who had just spoken with Richard Mealand, a story editor and

casting director at the London office of Paramount Pictures. Mealand toldLennard that he had been instructed by his Hollywood superiors to be on thelookout for an actress to star in a movie to be made in Rome the followingsummer. He had in hand a list of British studios and contract players, and onhis desk, he said, was a magazine cover with a photo of—what was hername?

IT HAD TAKEN more than five years to shape the screenplay of Roman Holidayinto something that could be filmed, and although a team of writers was stilltinkering with a few sequences, William Wyler had read enough that heagreed to direct, and Gregory Peck (who was longing to break out of moldand do a comedy) had signed on as the male lead. Peck’s agents had obtainedfor him a powerful prerogative in that deal: as a major Hollywood star thenappearing in his twentieth film, he had the right of approval when it came tothe choice of the female lead.

The story concerned a bored young princess who escapes from her gildedcage, explores Rome like a tourist for twenty-four hours, falls in love with anAmerican journalist and finally, dutifully, returns to her royal obligations.Peck and Wyler knew that the ultimate success of the film would depend onadroit direction, a blend of comedy, romance and restrained sentimentality,and most of all on the credible and unpretentious appeal of the two principalplayers.

Wyler’s previous three films—The Heiress, Detective Story and Carrie—had been critical and popular successes for Paramount. Meticulous,professional, incisive and sometimes ruthless with his actors, he had acompletely European sensibility, although he had left his Alsatian home forAmerica when he was eighteen and had, since 1920, directed fifty-ninepictures in Hollywood. In the business, he was known for wearing down evenseasoned actors like Bette Davis and Laurence Olivier with his demands forrepeated takes until, despite Wyler’s inability to explain precisely what hewanted, they somehow gave him memorable and often award-winningperformances.

By 1951, Wyler had two Oscars on his shelf (for Mrs. Miniver and TheBest Years of Our Lives), fourteen of his actors had won statuettes and thirty-six of them had been nominated. It is doubtful that anyone in Hollywood everknowingly turned down the opportunity to work on a William Wyler picture.

ROBERT LENNARD AGREED to send Audrey to meet the director. Apart fromany potential financial benefits to ABPC from a deal to loan her toParamount, Lennard sincerely liked Audrey and was pleased to advance hercareer if at all possible. She introduced herself to Wyler at Claridge’s Hotel;after only five minutes, he had an impression that she was “very alert, verysmart, very talented, very ambitious.” And her lack of an American accentwould make her more credible as a European princess. For her part, sherecalled simply, “I didn’t know what was expected of me.” More to the point,she had no knowledge of William Wyler or his films, and so she did not feelnervous or intimidated in the presence of a great Hollywood director.

Wyler ordered a screen test, which was made on September 18 and wasdirected by Thorold Dickinson, her mentor on Secret People. Dressed in afull-length white nightgown, she enacted a portion of the script of RomanHoliday in which, bored with the prim formalities and stifling protocol of herroyal station, the princess is put to bed by her lady-in-waiting; that role wasread off-camera by an assistant.

But Wyler, a savvy veteran, had arranged for more. He asked Dickinson toconspire with the crew to keep the camera rolling at the end of the scene. Atthat point, she sat up, clasped her knees, smiled broadly and asked withcomplete abandon, “Well—how was I? Was I any good?” For severalmoments, she bantered with Dickinson and the crew, the camera capturingboth her gaiety and her craving for approval. Her evident ambition was notsomething that came from a conniving, manipulative or seductive instinct: itsimply betokened the determination of a young woman both vulnerable andstrong who, despite her ignorance of the fine points of acting, was resolved toachieve the best she could.

Dickinson took the project further still. He asked Audrey to put off thecostume, put her street clothes back on and return to a chair on the set to chatwith him—while unknown to her, the film was still rolling in the camera. “Icame back and sat down and talked to him,” she recalled, long after she knewof the ruse. “He asked me a lot of questions about myself, about my work,and even about my past during the war in Holland…[and] that’s what madethe test. He had me on film being as natural as possible, not trying to act.”

The film of Audrey was rushed to Wyler, who was by this time back inHollywood. “The Hepburn test was very good,” he wrote to Richard Mealandon October 12. “Everyone at the studio was enthused about the girl, and I amdelighted. Please tell Dickinson that he did an excellent job.” Paramountexecutive Don Hartman added, “We were fascinated. It’s no credit to anyonehere that we signed her immediately.”

A contract was hurriedly composed and sent to her, and on October 15, atthe flat she shared with her mother, Audrey signed with Paramount to appearin seven pictures in as many years. She was allowed a year off between eachfilm and was permitted to do stage and television work during that year, butParamount had the right to loan her out to another studio for one of her sevenpictures. With that, Audrey Hepburn was perhaps the first inexperiencedactor in history to be contracted simultaneously for leading roles onBroadway and in film. That evening, James took her and her mother to dineat the Café Royal in Regent Street, where the champagne flowed likechampagne.

To settle the matter of Audrey’s legal commitment to Associated BritishPictures, Paramount wanted to buy out her contract for £100,000. Instead,ABPC executives realized that it would be preferable to receive a handsomefee for each film Audrey made for Paramount and also to acquire rights todistribute them in Britain. The unprecedented deal was made that autumn,and the principal beneficiary of it was none other than ABPC’s chiefstockholder and most active official—Jack L. Warner, who bided his time,secure in the conviction that one day Audrey Hepburn would work at hisstudio.

As for Paramount and Wyler, they were convinced that Gigi would run fora month, maybe two at the most, and that Audrey would be theirs early in1952 so they could complete Roman Holiday before the stifling heat of theItalian summer. The director showed the test to a warmly responsive GregoryPeck, and the matter of Audrey’s participation was settled.

BEFORE THE END of October, Audrey boarded ship for New York. She traveledwithout her mother, who had a job in London as an interior decorator andwould visit for the Broadway premiere; James would follow soon, too.

From sheer pleasure or anxiety or loneliness—or, most likely, acombination of causes—Audrey indulged in a kind of caloric abandon duringthe crossing, and by the time she was met at the West Side pier in Manhattan,she had managed to put on almost fifteen pounds. “When Gilbert saw her, hewas appalled,” according to Anita Loos. “He had engaged a sprite who hadsuddenly turned into a dumpling.”

The dumpling’s first task was to find a home. She had limited funds, butshe presumed that she could lease comfortable quarters in a good New Yorkhotel for a reasonable rate. Actors frequently booked at the Blackstone Hotelon 58th Street, and so Audrey asked to see the manager. He showed her abright and cheerful suite—but she was astonished to learn that the rate wasfifteen dollars per day. She could not spend more than nine, Audrey protestedto the manager. He was sympathetic, but fifteen it had to be. A few minuteslater, the manager shook Audrey’s hand and escorted her to the door with herreceipt for the room, which she had booked for nine dollars per day.

“I can’t say just how she got me to change my mind,” the manager saidlater. “She certainly didn’t bargain with me—good Lord, you couldn’tconceive of this elegant young woman lowering herself to haggle aboutmoney! She just talked and smiled and laughed, and somehow I found myselfbewitched into the notion that I had no right in the world to charge her fifteendollars.” Audrey’s charm was invariably persuasive, and few could resist.

The cast gathered all day for readings of the play, and then rehearsalsbegan at the Fulton Theatre, where the opening was scheduled for November24. At the same time, the dumpling was taken firmly in hand and the spritewas restored to form by Morton Gottlieb’s strategy of a crash diet: heescorted Audrey twice daily to Dinty Moore’s restaurant, next door to thetheater, where a large portion of steak tartare was her only daily meal. Thiswas a classic European dish composed of prime raw chopped sirloin with raweggs, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, onions, capers and spices. After amonth, Audrey was back in trim, and Dinty Moore’s remained a place sheliked—a colorful, sometimes raucous Irish tavern that served pub food, draftbeers and generous drinks. After the opening of Gigi, she frequently returnedwith friends to Dinty Moore’s, where she especially liked the poached eggson corned beef hash, washed down with a good Belgian beer.

AUDREY ARRIVED AT a favorable time in Broadway history, and there weregrand hopes for Colette’s play. While the theaters were sold out for monthswith successful musicals (Guys and Dolls, Call Me Madam, A Tree Grows inBrooklyn, The King and I and Anita Loos’s own Gentlemen Prefer Blondes),there were not many long-running plays; the exceptions were The RoseTattoo, The Four-poster, Saint Joan and The Moon Is Blue. Julie Harris wasabout to have a great triumph in I Am a Camera, but the arrival of Gigi wasmore than any show trumpeted about town, thanks to Gilbert Miller’shyperactive publicity machine.

Rehearsals proceeded mostly in French, which caused no problem forAudrey. Cathleen Nesbitt was also fluent in French, and she acted asoccasional interpreter for the other players. Nesbitt portrayed Gigi’s AuntAlicia and offstage became a kind of surrogate mother as well as bothcounselor and drama coach to Audrey.

Born in England in 1888, Cathleen Nesbitt made her London and NewYork theater debuts in 1910 and 1911. Among her stage and film credits inBritain and America, she is perhaps best known as Mrs. Higgins in theoriginal 1956 New York production of My Fair Lady. One of the great

beauties of her day, she had a historic romance with the poet Rupert Brookein 1912, three years before his death at twenty-seven.

Cathleen’s help was much appreciated, for the truth was that, apart fromher fluency in French, Audrey needed all the assistance she could get. “I’mfrightened,” she blurted out to a journalist one day after rehearsal. “I have nostage training whatever. Others spend their lives at it before they getanywhere. I guess I’ll have to act by intuition—until I learn.” Her humility,based in reality, served her well. Later in the decade, the deep impression herperformances made was due at least partly to the fact that she alwaysconsidered herself an apprentice, acting by intuition as she learned, studied,read and worked her way meticulously through the rigors of filmmaking. Shealso developed a shrewd ability to choose the right characters for herself—even in comedies, these were mostly women challenged by life’scircumstances who triumphed by courage, perseverance, wit and ingenuity.

“The role of Gigi required the technique of a seasoned actress,” as AnitaLoos recalled about the rehearsal period. “And in rehearsing Gigi’spassionate blowup at the climax of the last act, Audrey remained much morethe petulant teenager than a young woman suffering the sharp anguish of afirst tragic love affair.”

Cathleen Nesbitt came to the rescue. “Audrey was terribly frightened,” sherecalled. “She didn’t have much idea of phrasing. She had no idea how toproject, and she came bounding onto the stage like a gazelle. But she had thatrare thing—audience authority, and that makes everybody look at you whenyou are on stage.” Until the show opened, however, only the cast, directorand producer were looking at her on stage, and what they saw made themanxious indeed. Early each morning and late each evening, Cathleen andAudrey met, read lines, worked on diction and projection—and slowly, theirefforts began to yield results.

Besides her constant trepidation about her debut (and the fact that thesuccess of the play depended entirely on her), Audrey missed her mother andlonged for her fiancé—especially after she witnessed a terrible scene. Oneevening after she returned to the hotel from a full dress rehearsal and a late

supper at Dinty Moore’s, she was preparing for bed when a guest on theeighteenth floor jumped from his window and bounced off her windowsill ashe fell to his death. Shaking with sobs, Audrey fled her room and pounded onthe next door, which was opened by the actor David Niven; he and his wifegot Audrey through an upsetting experience and became lifelong friends.

FROM NOVEMBER 8 through 22, Gigi had an out-of-town preview at theWalnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, America’s oldest playhouse.Audiences were polite but not zealous, and the critics were mostlyindifferent. Miller, Loos, Gottlieb, Rouleau, Hepburn and Nesbitt had no ideahow to interpret the response. They decided against last-minute changes.

On the morning of Saturday, November 24, 1951, Audrey rose early. Sheput through a call to the wedding celebration of her half-brother Ian, who hadjust been married and would name his first child Audrey.

She then ate a light breakfast, took a walk on Fifth Avenue along CentralPark, read Gigi again, sent a telegram to Colette in Paris—and met CathleenNesbitt for the ride to the Fulton Theatre and the opening night. Neither ofthem ever forgot that Audrey was white and cold with terror.

She need not have been.

Most critics had tepid reactions to the play—but not to Audrey Hepburn,who in two hours leaped from obscurity to celebrity. Brooks Atkinson, in TheNew York Times, wrote that she was “a young actress of charm, honesty andtalent who ought to be interned in America and trapped into appearing in afine play…[She] is the one fresh element in the performance. She is anactress; and as Gigi, she develops a full-length character from artlessgaucheries in the first act to a stirring climax in the last scene. It is a finepiece of sustained acting that is spontaneous, lucid and captivating.” Anothercritic noted “a candid innocence and a tomboy intelligence…and herperformance comes like a breath of fresh air in a stifling season.” And a thirdpraised her “unquestionable beauty and talent. She acts with grace and

authority—if, in this case, without much relaxation.” There were a fewdissenting voices, among them that of Noël Coward, who attended thefollowing spring. As quick to praise as not, he nevertheless confided to hisdiary that Gigi offered “an orgy of overacting and a vulgar script. CathleenNesbitt good and dignified, and the sets lovely. Audrey Hepburninexperienced and rather too noisy, and the whole thing badly directed.”

By all accounts, the critical approbation did not diminish Audrey’s stagefright, which seems to have made her quite ill every evening; nor did itdiminish her conviction that she was doing very badly indeed. Her insecurityendured throughout her lifetime, as her elder son confirmed years later: “Shewas basically a very insecure person whose very insecurity made everyonefall in love with her…[She was] a star who couldn’t see her own light.” Herinsecurity and concomitant inability to appreciate her best gifts perhapsderived, at least in part, from a lack of parental endorsement, from the deeplyrooted effects of the war, and from the realization that there could besomething perilously selfish in the life of an actor—something she did not, onthe other hand, see in the disciplined life of a dancer.

After the first week of performances, Gilbert Miller ordered Audrey’sname placed above the title outside the theater. Audrey was commanded topose for the press, turning the last lightbulb in the last letter of her last name,so that when AUDREY HEPBURN finally illuminated the marquee, it seemed—but only in the photos—as if she might be electrocuted by sheer vanity. “Oh,dear,” she told reporters huddling around her as she climbed down from theladder, “I still have to learn how to act!”

She was twenty-two years old and, literally overnight, had become aBroadway luminary the way a naïve vedette becomes a star in a sentimentalmovie about a chorus girl leaping to stage center. Amid all the clinking ofglasses in the week following the premiere, and despite the massive bouquetssent to her dressing room, Audrey was resentful that Cathleen Nesbitt and theother cast members were virtually ignored by the press and the public.Autograph hounds clamored only for Audrey outside the stage door everynight and after every matinee.

Perhaps it was precisely the shock and the extreme nature of it all that ledher to distrust that what was happening would endure. Certainly she had noconviction that she had earned it. But not many people had any idea of thereal Audrey, a considerate and unpretentious young woman with impeccablemanners and unstuffy refinement, who could also be a clown, an irrepressiblemimic, a spontaneous turner of cartwheels and, as Milton wrote of Nature, alusty paramour.

THE BARONESS ARRIVED on December 19, attended a performance of the play,went backstage, smiled and hugged her daughter for the cameras—and,typically, offered no praise. Indeed, her remark can hardly have been whatAudrey expected or needed at the moment: “You’ve done very well, my dear,considering that you have no talent.”

On December 21, Ella stood just off-camera when a television crew visitedAudrey’s dressing room at the Fulton. Appearing on a live program calledWe, the People, Audrey spoke of Christmas 1944 in Arnhem, when she andher family were saved from the brink of starvation by a gift of ten potatoes.

In time for Christmas, the ardent James Hanson flew to New York from hisCanadian office. Proud of his fiancée, he squired her around town and, for theholidays, transferred her from the Blackstone to a suite at the far moreopulent Waldorf Towers; there he also installed Ella in luxury, on the samefloor. On Christmas Eve, James gave Audrey an emerald and diamond floralring in white gold.

But it was Cathleen Nesbitt whose presence in Audrey’s life that seasonwas more precious to her than anything. She was in every way the kind ofwoman and mentor Audrey respected and loved, and her affection wasreturned. Madame Rambert had certainly been encouraging—but only to apoint, and finally she had bad news for her young dancer. With Cathleen itwas very different: a patient and tireless teacher, she was the champion ofAudrey’s cause and the endorser of her talent. And when it was appropriate,she also offered the forthright praise that any young person needs in order to

continue in a difficult and demanding craft with so many public judgeswaiting to pronounce their critical opinion. Playing Audrey’s aunt onstage,she was so much more in life, and to far greater effect.

Cathleen was an example to Audrey of a successful, highly respectedactress with consummate dignity but without an atom of affectation orarrogance; by sheer example, she enhanced those same qualities in Audrey.Fulfilling a professional function as a tutor and an emotional one as anencouraging older woman, she offset both Ella’s incompetence and herincapability.

Cathleen Nesbitt had a long and troubled marriage to an alcoholic actornamed Cecil Ramage, a burden she bore in discreet privacy; their daughterJennifer, exactly Audrey’s age, was working successfully in England in 1951.The devoted rapport between Cathleen Nesbitt and Audrey Hepburn is easyto understand on both sides. A cherished friendship, it endured withoutinterruption until Cathleen died in 1982, at the age of ninety-three.

# Chapter Five

1952

“MY CAREER IS a complete mystery to me,” said Audrey Hepburn, reflectinglater on her success. “It’s been a total surprise since the first day. I neverthought I was going to be an actress, I never thought I was going to be inmovies, I never thought it would all happen the way it did.”

The fame certainly happened literally overnight. As the new year began,her face appeared glossily on the pages of magazines all over America. Lifeoffered a full-page spread and five photos, proclaiming “Audrey Is a Hit—Young Miss Hepburn Becomes Star on First U.S. Try.” Look agreed:“Audrey Hepburn—Her Star Is Rising.” In these and countless articles overthe next decades, journalists frequently stumbled and fell into a thicket ofempty clichés in the race to their typewriters.

She was, for example, routinely termed “elfin,” although an elf is(according to the Oxford English Dictionary) a mischievous, spiteful malecreature; she was regularly called “gazelle-like,” despite the fact that gazellesare spotted antelopes; she was often described as “coltish,” even if colts aremale horses…and so it went. “Gamine” was the usual designation—but theprimary meaning of the word is a street urchin or homeless waif. Themisapplication of words did, however, reveal that for Audrey Hepburn thepress needed a new vocabulary.

Whatever terms were used in print or conversation, people were certainlyenchanted with the real thing in person. Even among Manhattan’s coolsocialites, there were reports of audible intakes of breath when this twenty-two-year-old appeared at the wave of luncheons and prizes in her honor. A

group called the Twelfth Night Club gave a breakfast in Audrey’s honor (atone o’clock in the afternoon) on February 18, and a Westchester County huntclub hosted an event for her at the 21 Club on May 13, to raise money forcancer research.

Between those dates, and until Gigi closed in May after 219 performances,the leading lady had few weekdays to herself, for her diary was quicklycrowded with events. Gilbert Miller and his team of publicists were busyevery day, fielding calls for interviews—“and would Miss Hepburn beavailable for photographs with her charming fiancé?” No, she would not.That part of her life was off limits, she insisted. Newsmen did not know thatAudrey traveled by airplane to visit James in Toronto every Sunday morningwhen weather permitted, returning just in time for her Monday eveningperformance.

ON FEBRUARY 10, she made her dramatic debut on television, appearing liveon the Sunday evening variety show Toast of the Town. She portrayed LadyJane Grey in a few moments from the play Nine Days a Queen. Followingthat scene, Gilbert Miller joined Audrey for a chat with the show’s host, EdSullivan. Thus the publicity for Gigi rolled along.

On April 13, she was first seen on television in a complete, live half-hourdramatic role. Written especially for her by Meade Roberts and directed byDavid Rich, “Rainy Day in Paradise Junction” depended on Audrey herselffor much of the character of Virginia Forsyte.

“My father was English,” she says, explaining her accent to a group ofpeople waiting for a train in a small American town. As a lame sixteen-year-old girl, she captivates the attention of the lost souls in the café with herimprobable longing to be a dancer in Hollywood movies. “But most of all, Iwant to dance in ballet,” she says, with wistful earnestness. “You’re allthinking, ‘How in the world is a cripple going to be a dancer?’” And withthat, she tries to waltz with one of the café patrons. She knows this is only amomentary fantasy, and at the conclusion—as a close-up reveals both her

melancholy and her dignity—she boards a train to return to her sister inWichita. This was a fully realized performance with a remarkable mixture ofhumor and pathos, all the more important for Audrey because, despite itsbrevity, it allowed her to attempt something more serious than the youthfulantics of a Parisian adolescent.

AFTER GIGI’S ASTONISHING success, Paramount had agreed to postpone RomanHoliday—but only so long. By springtime, they could wait no longer, and soin consideration of a $\$ 50,000$ fee, Gilbert Miller posted a closing notice forMay: Audrey would leave Broadway and arrive in Rome the followingmonth. Miller also got a guarantee that Roman Holiday would be completedby the end of September, in time for Audrey’s return for a national tour ofGigi.

This required an intense preproduction schedule for the movie: the finepoints of every character’s wardrobe, the details of makeup, the logistics ofan enormous international crew working in Rome, the necessary legalclearances for filming at great monuments and palazzos, the strategy offinalizing actors’ schedules—everything had to be firmly in place so thatWyler, his cast and the technical team would have to deal only with the usualunforeseen daily circumstances, personal situations and delays that routinelyattend moviemaking.

In February, Audrey read the latest script version of Roman Holiday,which was not the last; in fact, it would not be finalized until the actualshooting was completed.

The development of this movie had already been long and complicated.First, Dalton Trumbo wrote a story that remained unpublished.*2 Then hisprose narrative was turned into a script by Ian McLellan Hunter, withadditions by John Dighton. They were not the first screenwriters on theproject. A team had worked with Frank Capra when he had hoped to do thepicture in 1946, and then, during the early Wyler tenure, Valentine Daviesand Preston Sturges signed on briefly to deal with some thorny scenes. Much

of the final script, however, must be credited to the great Ben Hecht, whotook over after Hunter and Dighton were off the project and who, as usual,cared not at all about credit as long as he was paid: Hecht actually wrote orrewrote more than two hundred movies but was credited with about sixty—his name appears nowhere on the film of Gone With the Wind, but the finalscript is mostly his. Later, even while Roman Holiday was in production, theeminent Italian writers Suso Cecchi d’Amico and Ennio Flaiano rewrotescenes for Wyler. “The picture was kind of put together as it went along,”according to the film’s editor, Robert Swink.

What seems like a messy and inefficient way of writing a screenplay isoften standard operating procedure in the business; indeed, some of the mostadmired movies were in fact masterpieces of improvisation. Producer DavidO. Selznick hoped that the script prepared by Sidney Howard and revised byothers would be “locked” when filming began on Gone With the Wind, butmajor changes had to be made during filming, and that is when Ben Hecht’sexpeditious brilliance was required.

As the laborious process of constructing the script and the shootingschedule proceeded without Audrey, some things required her attention evenduring the run of the play. In February, for example, Edith Head swept intoManhattan from Paramount’s California offices with her portfolio of ideas forAudrey’s costumes. A native Californian of keen intelligence, educated atStanford and always intensely ambitious for her hegemony, Edith, then fifty-five, suffered no fools gladly, in or out of her studio. Always seen andphotographed wearing dark glasses (the better to camouflage certain agelines), she forced her black hair into severe bangs over her forehead, à laLouise Brooks in the 1920s, and her voice had an oddly strident pitch.Neither especially feminine nor particularly graceful, she neverthelessdesigned some of the most glorious costumes for Hollywood women. Eitherdirectly or through her staff at the studios, she was involved in more thanseven hundred films and was awarded the Oscar eight times, more than anyother individual.

During her sixty-year career (first at Paramount, then at Universal), Edithseemed to have no enemies in the business—perhaps because she refused to

discuss the stars whose forms and figures she knew so well and who confidedin her. Edith was diplomatic as few in the business were, and although shehad a kind of stiffness many found off-putting, she refused to malign anyone.That discretion restricted her usefulness for gossip at parties, but it alsogained her the loyalty she prized. For her first two movies, Audrey workedgenially with Edith, who always claimed that no actress ever made her taskeasier.

Audrey arrived at Edith’s hotel room wearing a dark suit with white collarand cuffs, a sprig of white lily-of-the-valley in her buttonhole and whitegloves. “This was a girl way ahead of high fashion,” according to Edith. “Shedeliberately looked different from other women and dramatized her ownslenderness into her chief asset.”

Edith appreciated Audrey’s intelligence and directness and quickly had theimpression that this young actress knew more about fashion than any actressexcept Marlene Dietrich. “But what impressed me most was her body. I knewshe would be the perfect mannequin for anything I would make. I knew itwould be a great temptation to design clothes that would overpower her. Icould have used her to show off my talents and detract from hers, but I didn’t.I considered doing it, believe me.” That she did not was a testimony to EdithHead’s cool professionalism—and to Audrey’s polite but firm insistence onher own ideas.

With a height of five feet seven inches and a waist of just twenty inches,Audrey had the perfect model figure. Unusual for her time, she wore noshoulder pads and refused to pad her brassiere. To Edith’s sketches, Audreymade significant additions, especially the style of simpler necklines, widerbelts and flatter shoes for the movie spree around Rome. She alwaysconsidered her wardrobe for films as personal as her outfits for everyday use,and in her gently resolute way, Audrey Hepburn would teach every designerthat she never wore anything she had not approved or to which she had notmade some significant alteration. Only rarely was she off the mark.

Very soon after Edith departed New York, two men arrived fromParamount’s makeup department. In 1952, cosmetics for black-and-white

films were exceptionally complex and detailed; the ingredients andprocedures for each sequence depended not only on skin type but also on thepersonality of the character, the interior or exterior lighting required, theclothing worn—and of course the extent of the actor’s vanity. The on-setsupervision for Audrey in Rome was done by the great Italian cosmeticianAlberto De Rossi, but Paramount’s Wally Westmore sent ahead the materialsfor testing on Audrey, with specific instructions on their use:

First apply #12 Hi Light to the dark circles under the eyes, then powder.Apply 626-C Panstick all over the face, then rub gently to spread itevenly. Then pat the face all over to remove any finger marks. Use 626-C Panstick and #12 Hi Light mixed, and apply lightly under the eyes inthe same dark area as before. Apply blue-grey eye shadow to the eyelidsand smooth down gently. Powder under the eyes first and then the restof the face and eyelids. IMPORTANT: Don’t use too much powder. Sheshould have a nice skin sheen and not the dull flat look. Then brush offexcess powder. Line the upper eyelid with brown pencil, NOT BLACK,close to the eyelashes to make the lashes appear heavier. Add brownmascara only to the upper lashes. Apply lip rouge. Cover the exposedparts of the body with 626-C Pancake.* 3

Audrey’s contract with Paramount had been in place since the previousautumn, but the details for her participation in Roman Holiday had to befixed. Finally, on March 20, the deal was countersigned. Audrey was to startwork in Rome on June 1; her salary was a total of $\$ 7,000$ for twelve weeks ofwork (payable in weekly installments of $\$ 583.33$ , with an additional $\$ 250$per week to cover living expenses. That year, Twentieth Century–Fox waspaying Marilyn Monroe (then twenty-six) slightly less than Audrey received,and with no expense allowance; Elizabeth Taylor (age twenty) commanded$5,000 a week and virtually whatever trinkets she desired from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Appearing in his twentieth picture, Gregory Peck received$100,000 and $\$ 1,000$ weekly living expenses.

“I went to work for the money, because I had to,” Audrey said of this time.“But I was one of the lucky ones. I chose a profession I liked, and I wasterribly fortunate in being discovered by William Wyler—and from then on, I

went into such quality movies that I was able to accept them for the joy ofdoing them. And I would have been crazy if I hadn’t!”

THE LAST PERFORMANCE of Gigi was presented on May 31; a few days later,Audrey left with James for a Paris holiday. Because of the late closing of theplay, they decided to postpone their wedding from June until late September,after Roman Holiday concluded. From Paris, she proceeded to Rome on June12, and he returned to work in London and Toronto. Everyone presumed thatthe marriage would go forward in the autumn, before Audrey returned for theAmerican road tour of Gigi.

She had not so much as visited Hollywood yet, although the film wasofficially Audrey’s first American picture—but it was so only in the sensethat it was made under contract to and financed by an American company.Paramount had previously earned the money in Italy, but the funds had beenfrozen by the Italian government, the better to ensure employment for Italianworkers after the war. Roman Holiday was made entirely on location in andaround the city, and the interior scenes were shot at the Cinecittà studios.

Apart from record heat and humidity in Rome that summer, themoviemaking experience was an exceptionally gratifying time for everyoneinvolved, and the common feeling was that the newcomer was largelyresponsible. “She is that almost extinct type—a serious student of acting,”said Wyler, who was not easily impressed with young stars. More to thepoint, there was, according to Peck, “nothing mean or petty about [aboutAudrey]. She had a good character, so I think people picked up on that. Shedidn’t have any of the backstabbing, grasping, petty, gossipy personality thatyou see in this business. I liked her a lot; in fact, I loved Audrey. It was easyto love her.”

Most people took his last statement for what it meant—an assertion ofloving friendship—and interpreted nothing more. But the question of anaffair was whispered for decades by those who dine on rumors or cook themup for others. Without an atom of evidence and despite silence on the matter

from the principals, tales of a romance flew wildly from Rome to Hollywood;even today, there are those who swear it was a reality, although no one hascome forth to assert that he held the lamp. Peck had, in fact, recently met andwas ardently courting his inamorata, Véronique Passani, a French journalistwho was to be his second wife. In addition, James Hanson rushed to spendevery weekend with Audrey—and was often present during the week, too.They spent their free time in an air-conditioned suite at the Hotel Hassler,planning their wedding.

The high spirits of Hepburn and Peck and their relaxed, genialcollaboration certainly contributed to their remarkable onscreen performancesthat summer. Peck “always put me at ease before starting a scene,” sherecalled. “It was a happy company, without anybody going temperamental orputting up emotional barriers. I soon learned to relax, to look for guidancefrom Peck and Wyler. I trusted them, and they never let me down.” As forher co-star, he regretted that so many people primarily thought of Audrey “asregal—but I like to think of her as spunky.”

For decades, Peck delighted in telling interviewers that early in theshooting, he realized that Audrey was delivering a first-rate performance, andthat the film was certainly as much (if not more) her story than his. And so,he said, he contacted his agent in Hollywood. His contract stipulated thatonly his name was to appear above the title of the film, but he wanted thatchanged: Audrey was magnificent, she would very likely win an Oscar, andher name belonged above the title with his. The agent demurred, but Peckpressed him—and so, thanks to his generosity, Audrey’s name was indeedmoved above the title to accompany his.

There is no doubt that, in his career as in his personal life, Gregory Peckwas an enormously considerate and generous man; that many peoplebenefited from his kindness and support; and that the circle of his friends andadmirers was wide and inclusive. But in the matter of Audrey’s credit, hismemory was imprecise. In fact, as the production files for Roman Holidayreveal, it was Wyler and the studio personnel in Hollywood who had the ideato bill Audrey Hepburn above the title with Peck, but they realized this was adelicate matter because of the actor’s contract.

After filming was completed, Wyler returned to Hollywood for the editingprocess. When he saw the first cut and had his high estimate of Audrey’sperformance confirmed by the images on screen, Wyler made therecommendation to Paramount that they reconsider the credits. His assistantreceived a swift reply on January 20, 1953: “The Audrey Hepburn credit [yourecommend] is not strictly in accordance with the contractual agreement withGregory Peck, although we do not see any problem in getting him to agree tothis setup—but we do need his consent. Therefore, please explain this toWilliam Wyler and have him get Gregory Peck to initial the attached billingopposite the Audrey Hepburn credit.”

On or about January 25, Wyler met Peck for lunch and made the request,with which Peck agreed; he may well have regretted not suggesting the ideain the first place—hence his revised account. Still, his agent, the scrupulousGeorge Chasin, had to work out the exact language in a codicil to thePeck/Paramount contract: the credit must not be “Gregory Peck and AudreyHepburn in…” and there had to be no indication of star parity. The result ofthe legal sparring, even with Peck’s agreement to share credit above the title,may be seen in the finished picture. There is no doubt about the identity ofthe primary star, and no doubt about the presentation of a neophyte:

“She’s a very funny lady,” Peck said later, “and I have always thought thatshe should have played more comedy. They seized upon her with this imagein mind, and they practically put a halo on her head. In fact, they wanted todo [variations on] the Roman Holiday story over and over again. It’s not that

she hasn’t had a great career…but I wish that she had been allowed to do afew broad comedies along the way.” Later, part of the problem was the sheervulgarity of the so-called comic roles offered to Audrey; these she would notdo.

But everyone enjoyed Audrey’s earthy humor that summer. The castremembered her account of the tomcat adopted when Audrey was in thechorus of High Button Shoes. When he became too amorous with somefemale cats belonging to the players and orchestra members, the tomcat wassterilized. The chorus then discussed a name for him. “That’s easy—we shallhave to name him Tomorrow,” said Audrey innocently. Asked why, shereplied with perfect poise, “Because Tomorrow never comes.”

Audrey never found acting easy. Moviemaking is usually a chaoticbusiness, and she was enormously sensitive to noisy commotion. She neededtime to prepare; to concentrate and keep her focus, she required some quietdistance and some solitude on the set. Audrey was, in other words, not anactress who could swiftly move from casual chatter or idle joking to the taskof acting for the camera.

Usually, however, she could be a clown, and she seemed to enjoyeverything that summer—all the hard work; the necessary retakes during thelong, scorching afternoons; even the distractions of acting while surroundedby a crowd of gaping Romans and tourists. Nor did she object to Wyler’shabit of multiple takes. After the director had called for more than fifty takeson a single shot, Eddie Albert, also in the cast, recalled that the directorannounced earnestly, “That was fine—but we seem to have lost thespontaneity!”

Audrey was animated and exuberant, perhaps as only a young womancould be who was having sudden, unexpected success in what she loved todo; and it could not have diminished her exhilaration that she was engaged toan adoring and attractive man who flew to her side every day he could.

DECADES LATER, Roman Holiday has lost none of its bright appeal, itsrestrained sentiment and its incisive wit. The venerable conventions of thefairy tale, here put into clever reverse, are combined with elements of classicscrewball comedy, delicate social satire and (thanks to the performers) thestory of a tender but brief affection that cannot become an enduring romance.

Princess Ann (Hepburn), daughter of the king and queen of an unnamedcountry, travels on a goodwill tour of Europe. By the time she comes toRome, she is bored and angry with the stifling protocols, the endlessreception lines, the tedious schedule of royal engagements and the total lackof anything casual, informal, spontaneous or merely enjoyable: “Everythingwe do is so wholesome!” She longs to know something of ordinary peopleand common life, and in the presence of her lady-in-waiting, she sobsuncontrollably. A doctor is summoned and an injection given, but before ittakes effect, she changes into a simple blouse and skirt and steals out of theembassy. As she freewheels among crowds in the Roman night, she is at lastovercome by the force of the sedation.

Joe Bradley (Peck), an American journalist returning from a late-night cardgame, finds the princess sleeping near the Colosseum and, unaware of heridentity and believing her to be drunk, reluctantly allows her to spend thenight in his apartment. Next morning, he recognizes her and also a potentiallylucrative newspaper story. She, on the other hand, is unaware that she is to bethe subject when Joe and his photographer colleague Irving (Eddie Albert)show Ann the sights of Rome and oblige her whims for a day. She eats icecream, has her hair fashionably cut, buys a new pair of shoes, smokes herfirst cigarette, is arrested by the police for causing mayhem on a Vespa andgoes dancing at a riverside nightclub.

By the time Joe and Ann reveal their identities to each other, they are inlove, and he cannot betray her by turning in the story. Then reality intervenes;they realize they have lives separated by a complex of differing obligationsand professional duties; and after a last nighttime ride, she returns to herroyal life. At a reception for the press next day, Joe and Irving signal to Annthat her Roman holiday will remain their shared secret.

IT HAS OFTEN been claimed that the story of Princess Ann was modeled onBritain’s Princess Margaret, who fell in love with an older, divorced mannamed Peter Townsend and was discouraged (by her family and thegovernment) from marrying him. However, the Townsend affair wasunknown until 1953, after Roman Holiday was completed, and the unhappyend of Princess Margaret’s relationship did not occur until 1955. “We are notdrawing any parallel” between Ann and Margaret, Wyler wrote in a 1951studio memorandum, but the articles and stories on Margaret that they usedfor research did, at the time, “give us good insight into the life of a modernprincess.” It was, in other words, not Margaret’s personal life they studied(for they knew nothing of it in 1952), but rather her official activities and herwell-documented sense of fun. When the film was made, Margaret wastwenty-two.

IT IS NO EXAGGERATION to say that Roman Holiday would very likely havefailed if Audrey’s performance had not been so natural, credible, textured,witty and poignant. She moves with stately poise in her scenes as a princesson duty, while elsewhere, she cavorts, dances, falls in the river and tearsaround the city with the abandon of a teenager. In no sequence is she coy orfey, and there is no indication that she was wearied by Wyler’s habit ofdemanding multiple takes of a scene.

It is this completely balanced, highly nuanced portrait, without a falsemove or intonation, that ought to be taken into account when assessing thisstage of Audrey’s career, for in a way Princess Ann is Audrey. The daughterof the baroness, properly raised with all the refinements of Europeanetiquette, trained in the discipline of ballet and schooled in the deprivations ofwar, Audrey found a counterpart in Ann’s personality—the character as aspontaneous, giggling, frisky girl who knows how to frolic when she has thechance. Ann/Audrey does more than let her hair down, she has it cut off:when the barber shears Ann’s long, luxuriant tresses and leaves only the short

pixie cut we forever associate with the young Audrey, her face and the sceneare incandescent.

In this regard, Roman Holiday has some elements of screwball comedy—of Depression-era films like It Happened One Night and Holiday, in whichaudiences were told that the rich are not as happy as we commoners.Screwball comedy depended on a certain folksiness that is a staple of thecomic tradition—the notion, for example, that royals and the rich can trulyenjoy life only when they doff their finery, deny their privileges and comedown to earth, joining the masses and perhaps never returning to their gildedcages. But Roman Holiday scores its final emotional point—the poignancy ofpersonal happiness sacrificed to public duty—and thus is too honest to stopwith the last convention of screwball comedy. Joe and Ann simply do not livehappily ever after, at least not together.

Supporting this bittersweetness is the canny and comic use of the reversefairy tale. We first see the princess in a series of shots, clothed magnificently.Then there is a reception in which, coolly dignified, she makes a grandentrance, wearing a tiara and a spectacular ball gown; she maintains hercomposure during an interminable presentation line of internationaldignitaries. But her feet are aching, and we see beneath her floor-lengthgown: she has slipped off one shoe and cannot retrieve it—Cinderellaas-princess has lost her slipper. Soon we move to the scene in which SleepingBeauty/Snow White is approached by the handsome prince, but he cannotawaken her. At the final fadeout, she rushes back to the palace—not with theprince, but alone, to the embassy and her duties.

Sometimes directors succeed in conveying a rare and rich symbiosisbetween actor and character—an association that was perhaps neithersuspected in advance nor calculated in the moment. D. W. Griffith forevercaptured on film (in Broken Blossoms, for example) the delicate strength ofLillian Gish—the waif as victim, but also as provider. Josef von Sternbergwas somehow able to portray both the erotic insouciance and the spiritedfeminine wisdom of Marlene Dietrich (in, among other films, ShanghaiExpress). Alfred Hitchcock celebrated both the insistent passion and therisky, romantic idealism of Ingrid Bergman (in Notorious). Federico Fellini

revealed the artless simplicity and the profound humanity of his wife,Giulietta Masina (in Nights of Cabiria).

In that tradition, a seasoned director with the painstaking exactitude ofWilliam Wyler was needed to evoke from Audrey what is essentially anencoded portrait of herself in Roman Holiday, and this revelation wascertainly far beyond the intention of either director or actress. In each of hersubsequent films, these complementary parts of her character became evermore clarified—the polite and the playful aspects, the dedicated and thewillful, the idealistic youth and the grown-up who endures a kind of moraleducation. In Roman Holiday as elsewhere, Audrey is never woodenlyconsistent. She is not a material girl but a mercurial one, a constant nymphwho can be royal or sassy, regal or spirited, depending on the moment.

YET AUDREY COULD not yet be considered a seasoned professional in 1952.Indeed, some aspects of a scene could present special problems. Like manyactors, she could not weep naturally on command. For such situations, therehave always been vials of certain eyedrops on film sets, manufactured tobring forth the necessary tears.

“When we got to the last scene,” Audrey recalled, “we were in the car, andI was saying goodbye to Greg and going back to being a princess. I wassupposed to sob my heart out. But I couldn’t cry. I was pretending to cry, butit was no good at all. There were no proper tears. They tried glycerin. Takeafter take, it wasn’t any good. Willy [Wyler] came over and gave me absolutehell. ‘How long do you think we’re going to wait here? Can’t you cry, forgoodness’ sake? By now you should know what acting’s about!’ I was soupset—he was so angry with me. I just started to cry. He shot it, gave me abig hug and walked off. That’s how you learn. He knew with me there was nopoint in trying to teach me. He would just make me cry.”

WHILE THE FILMING proceeded, Gilbert Miller sent frequent reminders toParamount’s offices in Los Angeles and Rome, for he intended to hold themto Audrey’s contracted return for the long national tour of Gigi, which hadbeen firmly booked across the country for autumn 1952 and into 1953, andshe was expected in New York on October 1. These memoranda were notunforeseen, and so Paramount calculated that the last day they could useAudrey in Rome would be September 30. Someone reasoned that if she hadto be in New York by October 1, she could depart from Rome by airplanethat day, and by regaining the time en route, she would arrive that evening—unable to work, of course, but legally in fulfillment of the obligation that shebe physically in New York on October 1. The studio had no obligation toconsider her marriage plans, which in any case no one had discussed whenthe shooting schedule was finalized in late May.

But complications of another sort were threatening.

Beginning in early July, James Hanson had begun to interfere in the matterof Audrey’s schedule—to persuade Paramount to hurry along the filming.She tried to deter him from this intervention, but he only became moreinsistent: he would be her protector and defender against the Hollywoodbrass, and they would have all the time necessary to prepare for the wedding.

On July 8, Hanson wrote to Henry Henigson, the Paramount executiveproducer assigned to the picture: “It appears to be possible for Miss Hepburnto return to New York on the Queen Elizabeth on September 24. MissHepburn hopes to be able to take the boat from Southampton, as she hassome affairs to attend to in this country [England] before leaving.” He thenreferred to an earlier letter, in which he had asked if it were possible for thefilm to conclude in early September, which would allow them ample time forthe wedding, which, curiously, he did not mention.

In early August, due to the inevitable delays and the necessary postdubbingat Cinecittà, the completion date of the picture had been pushed back toSeptember 25. This allowed Audrey and James only one week for theirwedding and a foreshortened honeymoon before she returned to work inAmerica.

As much as she longed to be married, she intended to honor her contractualobligations: she was sorry, she told James, but she had no control over theshooting schedule, and she was sure he understood the necessity of herresuming the tour. Why could they not be married in New York? she asked.To this he was not agreeable: his family had certain social expectations, afterall.

During those torrid weeks, there occurred another kind of interference. TheLondon tabloids featured photos of the handsome James Hanson, with this orthat attractive young actress or socialite on his arm, attending a play or aparty in London or Paris, or emerging from this or that nightclub.

On August 12, Hanson wrote again to Harry Henigson, this timedemanding that Audrey be released in mid-September so they could marry inEngland before going on to New York and the resumption of the Gigi tour:“Our present plan is to leave Rome on September 21 for London”—which, ashe had to realize by then, was impossible. Five days later and quite on hisown, he issued a press release through his London office: “Audrey Hepburn,the British actress, and James Hanson, whose family operates several haulageand bus companies in England and Canada, will be married on September 30.Miss Hepburn, who is starring with Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday, nowbeing made in Rome, said the wedding would take place in Huddersfieldparish church, Yorkshire, England.”

With that, Paramount’s American executives—unaware of any such planscontacted Audrey. She had asked to be given, at the end of production, thesplendid wardrobe that had been designed for her, along with the dozens ofaccessories, including handbags, shoes, hats and costume jewelry. The studioinformed her that they hoped she would accept all this as a wedding gift.

Very soon, the ironies were compounded, for Audrey Hepburn announcedthe termination of her engagement to James Hanson. “We decided it was thewrong time to get married,” she said. “My schedule commits me to a moviehere, then back to the stage, then back to Hollywood. [James] would bespending most of his time taking care of his business in England and Canada.It would be very difficult for us to lead a normal married life.” In those days,

the press made nothing more of the matter.

James’s executive manner, his peremptory actions and his other romanticentanglements had cost him his fiancée. But there were other considerationson Audrey’s mind. Ella had chosen her two husbands unwisely, and bothmarriages had ended in divorce—a situation her daughter did not want torepeat. She felt she had to succeed where Ella had failed, and she did notwant to subject her children to the confusion and unhappiness she herself hadknown as a child.

She arrived unescorted in New York on the appointed day. Gilbert Millerand the cast (some of them replacements) noted her exuberance and energy;she was, Audrey said, happy to be back. Yes, the work in Rome had beenwonderful, unforgettable; of her private life she said nothing.

For the months ahead, Audrey was not tied down to one spot at all, for thebusy national tour of Gigi took her across the country, to places she had nevervisited. Among other cities, she played to audiences in Baltimore, Pittsburgh,Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago and San Francisco. She was making her way toHollywood.

# Chapter Six

1953

IN 1952, THE UNEXPECTED Broadway success of Gigi had delayed the filmingof Roman Holiday and caused more than the usual financial and logisticalheadaches for executives at Paramount Pictures. But the tension was easedwhen Gigi’s prolonged national tour, from October 1952 to June 1953,coincided with the final editing and music scoring for Roman Holiday; now,the timing could not have been more perfect for the studio. As Audrey madeher way across America, she was providing Paramount with extremelybeneficial advance publicity. When she began two weeks of performances atthe Biltmore Theatre in Los Angeles in March, everyone who had picked upan American newspaper or magazine knew about the imminent release ofRoman Holiday.

“We were there to shield her from the press when that was necessary andto allow the press access to her when that was helpful,” recalled ArthurWilde, at the time Paramount’s publicist assigned to Audrey in Los Angeles.“She was of course very classy and demure with the public, but she knewexactly what she was doing, and she did things in her own way. Audrey waseasy to work with, always cooperative and without any high-handed attitude—and she was really her own best publicist. But it was clear that she had noplans to be merely the tool of the studio.”

According to Wilde, there was some concern at Paramount over Audrey’sflat-chested, almost boyish figure, which was certainly an exception amongAmerican stars during the primacy of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.“I had the unfortunate task of informing Audrey that the studio might ask herto pad her bust off-screen as well as on. But she was adamant that she would

change nothing in her appearance—she would be herself or no one at all. Ofcourse she was right. She started an entirely different look in America, and in1953 she was the one incomparable newcomer. The press had never seenanyone like her.”

That year, rumors swirled in and out of the columns about Audrey’s nextprojects. Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who had seen a preview of RomanHoliday, wanted her and John Gielgud to appear in a film of Twelfth Night;Gielgud countered that they might appear to better advantage in a screenversion of The School for Scandal. At the same time, it was inaccuratelyannounced that Audrey would appear with Laurence Olivier, under PeterBrook’s direction, in The Beggar’s Opera; that she would star in a Frenchcomedy, La Cuisine; that she would travel to Venice and appear as YulBrynner’s co-star in A New Kind of Love; and that she would be MarlonBrando’s leading lady in Desirée.

To her surprise and amusement, Audrey was also offered the role of aJapanese bride (again opposite Brando) in Sayonara, and on this matter shespoke frankly: “I couldn’t possibly play an Oriental—no one would believeme! They’d laugh. It’s a lovely script…[but] I know what I can or can’t do.And if you did persuade me, you would regret it, because I would beterrible.” None of these enterprises reached the stage of serious discussion,for Paramount already had a second picture planned for their rising star.

THE 1940S and 1950S were remarkable decades in the theater, and very oftenNew York scouts for the studios conspired with theatrical agents to purchasemovie rights to plays even before they opened. In addition to the manysuccessful musicals that reached the screen, there were films based on worksby Tennessee Williams (A Streetcar Named Desire), William Inge (ComeBack, Little Sheba), Robert Anderson (Tea and Sympathy), Arthur Miller(Death of a Salesman), Eugene O’Neill (Mourning Becomes Electra) andCarson McCullers (The Member of the Wedding), among many others.

Sabrina Fair, a comedy by Samuel Taylor, was scheduled for a Broadwaypremiere in November 1953, and long before rehearsals began in New York,Paramount snapped up the screen rights. Billy Wilder, a successful director atthat studio, agreed to add Sabrina (its shortened movie title) to his impressivelist of credits that included Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend and SunsetBoulevard.*4

Months before rehearsals began for the New York premiere of SabrinaFair, Samuel Taylor went from New York to Hollywood to work with Wilderon the screenplay. His four-act comedy was the story of the exceedinglywealthy Larrabees of Long Island, a family with two unmarried sons.Fairchild, the family chauffeur, has a dazzlingly witty daughter namedSabrina, who has just returned from five years in Paris and is now “a womanof the world” (the subtitle of Taylor’s play). There are two Larrabee brotherswho catch sight of the transformed Sabrina—which of them will win herhand, and does she want either of them to do so? The romantic resolution ofthe play was not nearly so important as the playwright’s wise comedic sensethat led to that resolution, and the fine interplay among the characters hecreated. (The play eventually ran for more than nine months and 318performances.)

Samuel Taylor’s literary wit, his elegant language, his essential love ofpeople and the social subtleties of Sabrina Fair were doomed in Hollywood.Wilder insisted on a complete overhaul of the play, which of course he wascontractually free to do. After two months of work with the director, Taylorsaw that his play, his characters and his themes were all becomingunrecognizable. He fully understood the changes, additions, deletions andtranspositions that were required for a successful movie, but he could notagree that the wholesale despoliation of his play and its purpose were amongthe exigencies. (That Taylor was a gifted screenwriter is clear from AlfredHitchcock’s Vertigo, which he single-handedly rewrote after a disastrous firstdraft by another playwright.)

Taylor felt, with considerable justification, that Wilder was vulgarizing hisdelicate comedy, and—irate but polite as always—he bade Wilder farewelland returned to New York, where he could far more happily attend rehearsals

for his play.

Ernest Lehman, who had just completed the script for Executive Suite andknew how businessmen and socialites spoke, was then engaged to redraft thescript with Wilder. But Lehman, who later wrote superb screenplays for TheKing and I, Sweet Smell of Success (based on his own story), North byNorthwest, West Side Story and The Sound of Music, could be as stubborn asthe director, and their collaboration was thorny when it was not openlyhostile. Still, they chugged along on the script, which was still beinghammered out even after production finally began in early October.

WHILE WILDER AND Lehman worked on the screenplay of Sabrina andParamount approved an autumn start-date for filming, Audrey concluded herstage tour of Gigi with sold-out performances in San Francisco. Edith Headarrived there with costume designs for the new picture, and according to her,“Hepburn now realized that she was a star, and she wanted more say aboutwhat she wore” than she had when the two women had met about thecostumes for Roman Holiday.

Audrey’s politely outspoken independence—to which the schoolmarmishEdith Head was not at all accustomed—does not contradict Arthur Wilde’sobservation that she had developed no high-handed attitude: Audrey simplyknew what clothes suited her and her character, and she had a calmconfidence in her sartorial choices that she did not always have in her owntalent. Her final selection of wardrobe would await her forthcoming journeyto Paris, where she would have a look at the new fashions.

As Edith learned, Billy Wilder and Paramount executive Don Hartman hadconceded to Audrey’s request that she be permitted to buy her wardrobe forSabrina in Paris as if she were purchasing clothes for herself—henceParamount would neither be forced to give onscreen credit to a foreigncouturier nor to pay taxes or duties on imports. (She was also instructed towear those purchases in Europe so that they could be packed and shippedback with her, as obviously personal items; she would, of course, be

reimbursed by the studio on her return.) Meanwhile, Audrey won over Edithby taking her on shopping tours in San Francisco, where they interruptedtheir excursions by slipping into one of the city’s patisseries for Frenchpastries.

On June 20, just as the coronation festivities honoring twenty-seven-year-old Queen Elizabeth II were in full swing, Audrey traveled to London for theBritish premiere of Roman Holiday. There, she stayed with her mother, whowas working in South Audley Street. The baroness scheduled severalreceptions for Audrey, William Wyler, Gregory Peck and the Paramountcontingent.

Cecil Beaton, the photographer, designer and memoirist, was among thosewho attended one such gathering on the evening of July 23; Peck had broughtalong a friend, the American actor-director-writer Mel Ferrer, who toldBeaton that Audrey was “the biggest thing to come down the turnpike.”Beaton described her in more original terms:

“At last the daughter appeared—a new type of beauty: huge mouth, flatMongolian features, heavily painted eyes, a coconut coiffure, long nailswithout varnish, a wonderfully lithe figure, a long neck, but perhaps tooscraggy. [Her] enormous potential cinema success seems to have made littleimpression on this delightful human being. She appears to take wholesaleadulation with a pinch of salt: gratitude rather than puffed-up pride.Everything very simple about and around her: no maid to help her dress or toanswer the door to the guests who had now started a slow trickle into theroom…In a flash, I discovered [her] spritelike charm, and she has a sort ofwaifish, poignant sympathy.”

Beaton became an admirer at once, and eventually became a collaborator.The chemistry between Audrey and Mel Ferrer was not so simple. He toldher how fine she had been in Roman Holiday; she said that she relished hisperformance in the film Lili. These civilities only lightly concealed a fiercesexual attraction between the twenty-four-year-old ingenue and the courtlyveteran almost twelve years her senior, who happened to be married.

SIX FOOT THREE, slender and gallant, Melchor Gaston Ferrer was born into awealthy and cultivated New Jersey family in August 1917. His father was arespected Cuban American surgeon with a successful New York practice, hismother a prominent socialite. One of Mel’s sisters and a nephew eventuallyworked as editors for Newsweek magazine, while another sister became abrilliant heart specialist who went on to develop the life-saving procedure ofcardiac catheterization; a brother, José, was also a physician. Mel attendedPrinceton University for two years, worked as an actor in summersemiprofessional productions, edited a small-town New England newspaperand, in 1940, published Tito’s Hats, a children’s book celebrating the bondbetween a father and son.

By 1953, Mel had already been married three times. At twenty, in 1937, hewed a sculptress and aspiring actress named Frances Pilchard, by whom hehad two children. After divorcing Pilchard, he married Barbara Tripp, whoalso bore him two children. He then divorced Tripp and, in 1942, remarriedPilchard—to whom he was still wed when he met Audrey that July.

Between September 1938 and December 1940, Mel had playedinconsequential roles in three Broadway plays. With his father’s supervisionand an admirable willpower, he overcame a bout of polio. He worked as adisk jockey in Texas and Arkansas and returned to New York full oftheatrical ambitions for which, alas, there seemed little rationale in detectabletalents. But Mel was urbane, articulate and stylish, and those qualitiesimpressed the loutish Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures, who engaged him todirect a disastrous low-budget film in 1945. Returning to New York, Melthen directed the actor José Ferrer (not a relative) on Broadway in StrangeFruit and in Cyrano de Bergerac; the latter was enormously successful.

Unaware that Cyrano had to be completely restaged by another directorbefore its premiere, producer David O. Selznick brought Mel back toHollywood, where he acted in and directed a few films to no memorable

effect. At that time, he met and befriended a number of actors who had beencontracted to Selznick—Gregory Peck, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy McGuire andJennifer Jones (who was then the second Mrs. Selznick). They established anacting company based at the La Jolla Playhouse near San Diego, where theypresented a series of astonishingly dull plays. When this enterprise wasprudently abandoned, Mel utilized his professional associations to bestadvantage and turned up at MGM, where he appeared in the popular movieLili.*5 That summer of 1953, his star, never ascendant, was swiftlydiminishing: his most recent film was something called Saadia, about astrange Arab girl with romantic powers fatal enough to destroy both hersuitors and the movie.

The week they met, Mel, with a lover’s temerity, told Audrey that sheought to return to the stage in another French play—but in something morepoetic than Gigi, something by a more mystic writer than Colette. If such aplay could be found, would she be interested in co-starring with him? Shewas. And so, from her assent and their precipitate romance, Mel inferred aluminous future for the two of them: they would be like Lunt and Fontanne,Olivier and Leigh. He hurried home to Frances Pilchard, to whom he spokewith disarming frankness, thus winning an uncontested second divorce fromher.

“It was fascinating to watch Mel move in on Audrey,” remembered RadieHarris, a respected Hollywood journalist who had known him since 1936.“After that first meeting [with Audrey], Mel never let go, and they wereinseparable.”

NOT, HOWEVER, as inseparable as Mel desired. He was obliged to return toLondon to complete the dubbing for his role as King Arthur in Knights of theRound Table, while Audrey and her mother departed for a brief seasideholiday at St. Jean de Luz in southwest France, near the Spanish border.From there, they went to Paris, where Audrey sought her wardrobe forSabrina. Her choice of designer forever established the look of AudreyHepburn in movies—and in private life.

Late in July, she presented herself at the atelier of Hubert de Givenchy, onthe rue Alfred de Vigny, opposite the Parc Monceau. A tall aristocrat withmovie-star attraction, he had been inspired by the houses of Balenciaga andSchiaparelli and was busily preparing his own first collection that summer.Energetic, refined and highly organized, Givenchy was positively patrician,but without an atom of pomposity or affectation.

His assistant announced that Miss Hepburn had arrived for herappointment. Expecting her namesake Katharine, Givenchy went to meet (ashe recalled years later) someone “like a very fragile animal. She had suchbeautiful eyes, she was so slender—and she wore no makeup!” Audrey wasdressed in plain trousers, ballerina shoes, a short T-shirt—and a straw hatberibboned with lettering (“VENEZIA”) suggesting a gondolier’s boater.Impressed though he was with her quirky charm, the designer had no time tospend with her creating a movie wardrobe. He did, however, invite her tolook at his ready-made collection, where perhaps she would find somethinghe had designed earlier. On the racks, Audrey found a gray wool suit—precisely what she wanted for the scene in which Sabrina returns to LongIsland, transformed by her sojourn in Paris.

Then she saw the fitted white strapless gown, embroidered with a blacksilk floral design and a detachable train: this she considered ideal for hercharacter’s grand entrance at the party, when at last David Larrabee noticesthat Cinderella has been transformed into a princess. Finally, Audrey selecteda black cocktail dress with a high boat-neck, secured at the shoulders withsmall bows.

That summer day, Audrey left Givenchy’s workrooms with these items forher next picture and, in the bargain, a friendship that never wavered for therest of her life.*6 Over the course of forty years, their mutual respect anddevotion grew into something beyond that of designer and mannequin orclothier and client. They both cultivated their natural styles—their sharedlove of gardens, for example, and of good (not necessarily expensive) foodand wine—into rare forms of a refined attitude toward life; with them, stylebecame substantial. “There are few people I love more,” Audrey said ofHubert. “He is the single person I know with the greatest integrity.”

For his part, he felt that “she always knew what she wanted and what shewas aiming for. She was a very precise person and a consummateprofessional. She was never late and she never threw tantrums. Unlike manyof her illustrious colleagues, she did not behave like a spoilt star. She knewexactly how to shape her strong, independent image. This naturally extendedto the way she dressed, and so she always took the clothes created for her onestep further by adding something of her own—some small personal detail thatenhanced the whole.”

The moviemaking and apparel-design industries are notoriously laced withpetty jealousies, and participants often mistake artifice and illusion for realityand substance. To the creation and presentation of clothes that were right forthis particular woman, Givenchy and Hepburn brought a respect for theindividual and a sense of simple elegance that invited others to look for theirown (not necessarily expensive) styles, not mutely to imitate theirs.

AUDREY WAS IN New York on August 27 for the national premiere of RomanHoliday, whose reviews—more enthusiastic by far than those accorded by theBritish press—placed her firmly in the hot glow of celebrity. “A remarkableyoung actress…Paramount’s new star sparkles and glows with the fire of afinely cut diamond…Through some private magic, Audrey Hepburn raisesthe enterprise to the level of high comedy…Miss Hepburn is an actress ofconsiderable eminence.”

To her credit, Audrey’s eminence was not at all clear to herself; indeed,she had already developed a healthy suspicion about journalistic euphoria. “Ihave to try to keep a balance about it all,” she said at the time, considering thearc of her career so far.

I want to retain the feeling that it is all happening to someone else, andat the same time have an idea of my own value and worth to thecompany. You see, I have always reached for something just above myhead. If I have been able to hold on, it is because I seized everyopportunity and worked extra hard. Nothing came easily. In [stage]

musicals, I was the tense, rigid girl trained for ballet who had to watcheveryone else to find out what to do. In the theatre, in Gigi, I actedwithout acting experience. The play was a success in America and theysaid nice things about me. But all through the sixteen-month run, I wasstill learning. By the last night, I was really only just ready for the firstnight. Then Roman Holiday—I was reaching again. Out of that curiousstudio life of camera, lights, noises and nerves, I had to try to bring atrue performance.

As for the critical raves:

This is the most trying time of my life. Just now, I am no more than apublicity star. I have been made by writers. But what they have made meinto is a shadow. I cannot become a substance until the public gives itsapproval.

As usual, the press wanted to know her plans for marriage. “I can’t do itjust now. Marriage is a full-time job. It takes more talent than acting. I can’tdo both and do both well…I have learned to do without.” To a question aboutMel Ferrer, who was her constant companion in New York during activitiesfor the premiere—and who was not yet free from his third marriage—Audreyreplied coolly that she would never be Mrs. Mel Ferrer, and so she may havebelieved. When she did marry, she added, no one would ever have to ask ifshe had been married before: “When I get married, I want to be verymarried.” Meanwhile, however, she was not immune to Mel’s charms, andthey spent what time they could together before he departed to work on anItalian picture. Well, Ella reminded Audrey, James Hanson, at least, did nothave the complication of a wife!

SABRINA SEEMED READY to roll into production in September, but there weredelays. The screenplay continued to exercise Wilder and Lehman, primarilybecause the play was being expanded to provide a number of locations inManhattan and on Long Island. In addition, there was the matter of Taylor’switty, allusive dialogue—apposite for the upper-class characters and fine forNew York theatergoers at that time, said Wilder, but lacking the grit and sexyhumor that would amuse mass audiences.

The difficulties accumulated. Cary Grant had agreed to play the role of

Linus Larrabee, the fierce industrialist who has no time for romance until hefalls for Sabrina; and William Holden, who had already appeared in Wilder’sSunset Boulevard and Stalag 17, was cast as the playboy brother, David. ButGrant, who was about to turn fifty, withdrew as the start date approached,protesting a prior commitment but really apprehensive about playing oppositetwenty-four-year-old Audrey. Wilder could not convince him otherwise. (Thefollowing year, Alfred Hitchcock had no such trouble, and Grant appeared togreat effect in To Catch a Thief with Grace Kelly, who was exactly Audrey’sage.)

With that, the director made an unfortunate decision: he offered the role toHumphrey Bogart, who was fifty-four but looked sixty-five and had neverundertaken light romantic comedy. Never mind, said Bogart’s agents whenParamount hesitated: Bogart was a professional—and after all, he wasmarried to Lauren Bacall, twenty-five years his junior (an argument that wasa classic irrelevancy). Decades of hard drinking had rendered Bogartweathered, dyspeptic and ill with the first symptoms of the cancer that wouldclaim his life four years later. As it began, the entire production was darkenedby his haunted demeanor. Whereas Cary Grant would have rendered aromance with Audrey believable, Bogart made it seem perverse—especiallybecause the movie audience was asked to believe that Audrey would quicklyshift her affections from the handsome Holden, then thirty-five, to thebattered Bogart. The difficulties were only beginning.

First, Audrey was required to do some singing in the picture, and so shespent the weeks of preproduction studying dialogue with one coach and voicewith another. “I had to,” she told a journalist at the time. “When I first camehere, I had no voice at all. It was terribly monotonous, shrill and inflexible—all of which it still is, only a little less so.” The men in dark suits atParamount politely asked Audrey’s new agent, Kurt Frings, if she might notbe a bit less forthright about such matters. She had a disarming habit ofletting daylight in on magic, as Walter Bagehot memorably said of the Britishroyal family.

That was the least of the matters requiring executive attention.

Martha Hyer, an attractive and versatile young actress, had been signed toplay Elizabeth, David Larrabee’s fiancée. “I quickly became aware that theset was a battlefield,” she recalled years later. “There was much friction, side-taking and intrigue during the filming. I don’t know why, but Bogie wasalmost paranoid in thinking that Holden, Wilder and Audrey were againsthim—maybe because he was insecure and didn’t feel comfortable in thepart.” Bogart also knew that Hepburn and Holden were rising stars, and thathis own career had peaked. Hell hath few furies like apprehensive actors.

In fact, things got off to a bad start after the first day’s work, when Bogartpoured drinks in his dressing room for a few of the cast and crew, but did notinvite Holden, Wilder or Audrey, who met in Holden’s dressing room formartinis and after-work chatter. After several days of these separategatherings, Wilder invited Bogart to join them and was curtly turned away;Wilder had failed to invite him at the outset, and now the lines had beendrawn, and henceforth no quarter was to be given. “Bogart thought that adirector must humble himself before Bogart,” as Bogart’s agent Irving Lazarsaid years later. “But on a Billy Wilder picture, there is no star but BillyWilder.” From that day, Bogart never ceased to complain about the director,his co-stars, the script and the crew. His scorn for the project continued rightup to the film’s premiere in September 1954.

Bogart was not the only major tippler on Sabrina. Holden was anotoriously heavy drinker, too, and, as Hyer remembered, “after a liquidlunch, he had to rest until he sobered up.” Bogart, who functioned better,noted an advantage one morning, when Holden was “very shaky, blowing hislines and not really in shape to work.” Bogart at once remarked in a stagewhisper, “Methinks the lad hath partaken too much of the grape”—and atonce the simmering resentments became open warfare. The men had to bepulled apart, and the makeup crew was hastily summoned for damagecontrol. That department had a much easier task with Audrey each day—anda good thing, too, for they had to devote far more time treating the blearyeyes of Bogart and Holden and reducing their alcoholic flush. Tactful,courteous and uncritical, she accepted the men’s damp shenanigans as typicalmanly behavior, par for the Hollywood course.

There was another reason for her tacit acceptance of Holden’s conduct:early into filming, they became lovers, and as Hyer and others remembered,“they were together most evenings after shooting.” At the same time, Audreyrelocated from her first residence, an apartment hotel at 3435 WilshireBoulevard (near Paramount Studios), to a two-room furnished rental at 10368Wilshire (closer to Holden’s residence), where their rendezvous wereconducted. In those days of the “morals clause” in Hollywood contracts—aparagraph that could destroy a career if public decency was offended by anactor’s private life—Audrey and Bill had to be extraordinarily discreet. Inthis case, the matter was compounded by the fact that he was married and afather. Of Mel, Audrey was uncertain; in any case, no promises had beenexchanged, and he was away at work. Playful, romantic and attentive, Billwas, for the time being, irresistible.

BORN IN 1918 into a prosperous Illinois family, William Beedle was the sonof an industrial scientist and a teacher who relocated to California when theboy was three. While a college student in Pasadena, he was noticed by aParamount scout. Rechristened William Holden by the studio, he appeareduncredited in two minor pictures until the leading role in Golden Boy (1939)raised him to instant stardom. In 1941, he married the actress BrendaMarshall, who divorced her first husband to marry him, and whosubsequently bore him two sons. Nothing about that marriage, which lastedthirty years, seemed authentic—for the most part, in fact, it veered betweenpathetic soap opera and low comedy.

From the start, Mr. and Mrs. Holden blithely engaged in a dizzying arrayof extramarital romances, usually with each other’s full awareness. Theseintrigues ended with mutual, tearful acts of contrition—before the nextparamour came into view. To prevent the complication of illegitimatepaternity, Holden decided, with Brenda’s encouragement, to undergo avasectomy in 1947. This decreased neither his libido nor the number of hisconquests, who, for obvious reasons, were delighted with the medical news.

Holden’s wife was ordinarily complaisant—until Audrey. In late October,

he brought her home for dinner (a curiously repeated pattern in the marriage),and Brenda at once picked up the scent of a real threat. Later, she demandedthat he end the liaison, but the lovers simply continued the affair at herapartment and sometimes, more injudiciously, in their studio dressing rooms.“Audrey embodied everything that he admired in a woman,” according toHolden’s biographer, Bob Thomas. “She was young—eleven years youngerthan himself. Audrey considered him the handsomest man she had everknown, and she was entranced by his manly charm and gentle humor.”

The charisma of good looks, charm and humor can be little more than themain features of seduction, and in this case they were wildly successful. LikeJames Hanson and Mel Ferrer, Holden was just that much older, and thisAudrey inevitably found alluring. And she was completely won over when hepromised to divorce Brenda and marry her. In a delirium of happiness thatmade their onscreen love scenes eminently credible, Audrey at once raisedthe issue of children: she wanted two, three, four and more—she wouldabandon her career to have a family. For a few weeks, until their last scenestogether, Holden temporized, and then he broke the news of his sterility.

On the spot, Audrey ended the affair. “I really fell in love with AudreyHepburn,” Holden said later, “but she wouldn’t marry me. So I set out aroundthe world with the idea of screwing a woman in every country I visited.”Years later, Audrey’s reaction to his tale of international intrigue consisted oftwo words only: “Oh, Bill!” Always fond and never censorious of him, shemay well have thought it providential that she never became Mrs. WilliamHolden. “They had great careers,” Billy Wilder reflected, “but they weren’thappy in their personal lives.”

THE CONTINUING BATTLEFIELD, as Martha Hyer called it, was rarely without askirmish. Bogart resented not only Holden but also Wilder and Hepburn. Oneday, the director brought Bogart some rewritten dialogue. “How old is yourdaughter?” Bogart asked, scanning the lines.

“My daughter is about seven.”

Bogart threw the pages back. “Did she write that?”

Things reached critical mass when Bogart mimicked Wilder’s accent andreferred to him as “a Nazi son of a bitch”—a singularly cruel thing to saybecause, as everyone knew, the Jewish Wilder had lost his mother, stepfatherand other family members at Auschwitz.

Bogart’s ill temper even extended to Audrey, who was never unpreparedfor a scene and almost always word-perfect on the first take. But onemorning, after she had just been handed new dialogue, she fumbled a line.“Maybe you should stay home and study your lines instead of going outevery night,” Bogart muttered with a wicked grin. (“I hated that bastard,” saidHolden. “He was always stirring up things.”) Audrey smiled, defusing themoment, and they continued the scene. Acting with Bogart was never easyfor her, not least because Bogart had a lifetime tendency to spit when hedelivered his lines. Wilder told Audrey’s wardrobe assistant to be ready witha towel after each take—“but to do it discreetly.”

With equal discretion about Bogart’s saliva, cameraman Charles Lang hadto be cautious with back lighting, which tended to reveal the smallest spray ofspittle. He was also anxious about Audrey’s appearance, especially when shewore the dazzling, strapless Givenchy gown. Production memorandadocument the problem of photographing her shoulders and neck so that theyappeared sexy instead of bony.

All during filming, Wilder suffered from back trouble and script problems.Ernest Lehman, who preferred order to chaos and the luxury of time to on-the-spot demands for new dialogue, described the production as desperatefrom start to finish. “It was still being written and shaped as we went,”according to Wilder, “and we were falling behind in the writing.” To coverhimself, he depended on the kindness of Audrey. A long scene with Bogarthad to be scrapped on the set. “I had to fill the entire day,” Wilder continued,“and I had to stall. So I went to Audrey and I told her the problem.”

Risking her own reputation, she at once went to the assistant director. “Oh,I have a terrible headache,” she said. “Please let me lie down a bit.” Fifteen

minutes passed, an hour, then half a day; Audrey was willing to play theprima donna before the entire company, “but she did not care,” according toWilder, “she just did it.” And with her help, Lehman and Wilder had time tosolve that day’s script problem.

“You cannot duplicate her or take her out of her era,” Wilder said, adding(perhaps in a reference to the Holden affair and certainly to her unpretentiouscollegiality), “She was something entirely different on the screen than whatshe was in life. Not that she was vulgar—she wasn’t…But there was so muchinside her, and she could put the sexiness on a little bit, and the effect wasreally something.”

And then, in late November and right on cue, up popped Mel Ferrer,bearing his divorce decree in one hand and a play in the other. As if to eraseall memories of Holden and Hollywood, Audrey accepted Mel’s offer toappear with him on Broadway early the following year, in an adaptation ofJean Giraudoux’s romantic fantasy, Ondine. Ferrer may have been inspired toselect this highbrow, obscure work by the fact that—like Sabrina—the titlecharacter’s name is that of a water sprite.

WITH SABRINA COMPLETED, Audrey invited Hubert de Givenchy to visit her atParamount and to attend an early screening of the picture. When the creditsappeared, Audrey was mortified and Hubert astonished to read “CostumeSupervision—Edith Head.” “They showed the film—and my name wasmentioned nowhere,” he said years later, recalling the studio’s blithediscourtesy. “Imagine if I had received credit for Sabrina then, at thebeginning of my career—it would have helped! But it doesn’t matter: a fewyears passed, and then everyone knew. Anyway, what could I do? And Ididn’t really care. I was so pleased to dress Miss Hepburn.”

Later, salt was added to the wound when, of Sabrina’s six Oscarnominations, only Edith Head won—and she had designed only one outfit forthe picture. Nevertheless, the indomitable Edith accepted the statuette withoutso much as a mention of Hubert de Givenchy, that evening or ever after.

“Edith always thought she designed everything in town,” as Billy Wilder’sagent said. “She was notorious for never giving an assistant credit, even if sheherself hadn’t done a thing.”

For her second film under the Paramount deal, Audrey was paid $1,000weekly—a total of $\$ 1234$ when the picture was complete; after her agent,lawyer and manager received their shares and taxes were withheld, she tookhome a little over $\$ 3,000$ . Her co-stars fared better: John Williams, in the roleof her father, received $12,000; William Holden, $80,000—and HumphreyBogart, $\$ 200,000$ .

Christmas brought Audrey a gratifying present when the influential tradepublication Film Daily announced the results of its annual poll of moviecritics: she and José Ferrer were voted the leading movie stars of 1953. Theadvance word on Sabrina was highly favorable, and when the film wasreleased in September 1954, Audrey and the picture were, it seemed, almostbeyond criticism. Roman Holiday told the fairy tale in reverse, but Sabrinafollowed the arc of Cinderella’s transformation from likable commoner tolovable “princess.”

Burdened with the era’s requisite exaggerated eyebrow liner, absurdlythick eyelashes and over-the-line lipstick, she found a way through the oftentedious thicket of the screenplay. Beside the historic miscasting of Bogart,Audrey had to play a girl—and she is never more than that—who has none ofthe distinctive eccentricity Samuel Taylor had given the character, and whichwas precisely the quality enabling forty-two-year-old Margaret Sullavan tocaptivate theater audiences in New York for forty weeks.

In the clipped cadence of her voice and with her sheer naturalwinsomeness, Audrey managed to counter Bogart’s charmlessness. Morethan a half century later, moviegoers seem content with the fairy tale, andthey ignore the essential hollowness at the core of Sabrina Fairchild’scharacter on screen. Indeed, little more is asked of the girl than that sheresemble Audrey Hepburn.

# Chapter Seven

1954

IN EARLY JANUARY 1954, hours before a fierce winter storm thrashed the city,Audrey and Mel arrived in New York to begin rehearsals for Ondine. Topresent the proper facade necessary at that time, they checked into separatesuites at the Gorham Hotel, the first of their Manhattan residences over thenext six months. The gossip columns noted their joint appearances all overtown, their inseparable social life and, almost as an afterthought, theircollaboration on the Giraudoux play. The general public may have chosen tobelieve that they were friends—a ruse italicized by Audrey’s protests thatthey were just dating—but anyone even remotely connected with the theaterknew this was already an ardent love affair. In 1954, dating meant sharingactivities like dinner at a restaurant or an evening at the theater—going outtogether. “Dating” had not yet acquired the connotation of those intimaciesshared by staying in together.

Ella arrived from London for an extended winter holiday three days afterthem; she was installed at the same hotel, for which Audrey paid her bill.Within weeks, she and Mel found their budgets strained almost to the point ofdebt: their incomes for 1953 were not nearly enough to support this lavishnew lifestyle, and their salaries in the theater were substantially lower thanthat in the movies. Economies were called for, and the first luxury to besacrificed was fancy dining; henceforth, unless they were invited guests,supper meant a simple meal at an inexpensive watering hole like DintyMoore’s.

ONDINE WAS PRODUCED by The Playwrights Company, which includedMaxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Elmer Rice, Robert E. Sherwood, SidneyHoward and (the most recent to join) Robert Anderson, then represented onBroadway by his successful play Tea and Sympathy. The director of Ondinewas the estimable Alfred Lunt, who had acted onstage since 1903 anddirected since 1940; he and his wife, Lynn Fontanne, had appeared togetherin no less than twenty-one classic and modern plays, including works byShakespeare, Chekhov, O’Neill and Coward. At her husband’s request,Fontanne was discreetly present each day of rehearsals for Ondine, whichbegan at the 46th Street Theatre in mid-January.

Lynn Fontanne very quickly became a strong support for Audrey, a gentlecoach and an ally—much as Cathleen Nesbitt had been during Gigi—especially because Audrey was, in her own words, “almost in a panic,thinking I had to be near-perfect to live up to the build-up, which wascolossal.” Afraid that she was not equal to the public’s expectations, Audreyalso looked for emotional encouragement to Mel, who was protective(indeed, proprietary); and to her mother, who was neither.

BASED ON AN early nineteenth-century fable by La Motte-Fouqué,Giraudoux’s play had been adapted and translated by Maurice Valency. Theplot, such as it was, concerned the eponymous water nymph or sprite—likeMilton’s Sabrina—who comes to earth and falls in love with the knight Hans(played by Mel). Warned that Hans will die if she proves unfaithful, Ondinemocks the social conventions and hypocrisies of the medieval court and thendisappears when she learns that Hans is destined to marry Berthe (MarianSeldes). To humanize herself, Ondine then returns, pretending that she hasbeen unfaithful, and Hans dies. With three sounds from the depths of thewaters, Ondine forgets her mortal interlude and returns to the sea nymphs.

A colorful but vague fantasy, Ondine has provided a wide field for criticaldiscussion: academics and audiences have never been certain what to make ofit, although Ondine seems to represent both the indifference of nature and itselemental oneness with mankind, and the play has elements of a wry satire on

marriage and the clash between idealism and reality. However one assessesits merits, Ondine depends very much on the appeal of the leading lady.

In 1939, Jean Giraudoux came to America after the Paris premiere andasked the Lunts to play the leading roles of Ondine and Hans; they liked theplay but prudently declined, rightly judging the characters too young forthem: at the time, Lunt was forty-seven and Fontanne fifty-two. But in 1954,a decade after the playwright’s death, they were at last involved, and Luntrelished the chance to direct it.

Robert E. Sherwood supervised the production for The PlaywrightsCompany. “I think Hepburn is absolutely ideal for the part of Ondine,” hewrote to Alfred Lunt on November 4, 1953. “She has had ballet training, andI think that is extremely important, as the whole play seems to have a balletquality.”

There was, however, no such enthusiasm for Mel Ferrer, who had broughtthe play to Audrey and had planned it as the first of their stage and screencollaborations; in exchange for her signature, the Playwrights had to agree tohave Mel as Hans. “We had the chance to bring Audrey back to the stage,”said Robert Anderson years later, “but the price was Ferrer. It turned out tobe far too expensive.”

The cost immediately became evident during rehearsals. First, and forreasons no one could fathom, Mel openly objected to Lynn Fontanne’spresence at rehearsals. Shamed by his conduct, Audrey wrote her a note: “Iam able to step out there with so much more happiness and confidence thanever before, thanks to your patient guidance and encouragement.” What shesaid to Mel is unknown.

Next, Ferrer complained that Lunt was too old to stage the play. He madeno secret of his contempt, openly smirking at the director’s suggestions to theactors and turning his back on Lunt in the middle of a conversation. “He didnot respond to direction as Audrey did,” according to Marian Seldes, “andwas ungracious to [Lunt] in front of the company at times.” Everyone foundthe situation deeply embarrassing. To make matters still more difficult, Mel

then approached Sherwood, demanding that the play be revised to enlarge hisrole—a request they rejected on the spot. But his arrogance remaineduntempered. “It was unfortunate,” Seldes continued.

Mel had done some theater as actor and director, and had worked infilms, too. In a funny way, he had gotten there first. But now it was quiteclear that Audrey was overshadowing him—not through her choice, butthrough the accidents of fame. He had brought the play to her, and so hetook the position that he had masterminded it all.

The rehearsals became more and more confused, for Mel was underminingLunt’s direction during the day by giving his own instructions to Audrey inthe evenings. “There was never a flare-up,” according to Seldes, “becauseAlfred was too much of a gentleman.”

While the cast found Mel’s attitude unendurable, they admired Audrey anddeveloped enormous affection for her. “I sat in the wings and watched her aswe rehearsed across the huge expanse of the 46th Street Theatre stage,”Marian Seldes recalled, “and I thought she was just gorgeous. But like manygreat beauties, she did not think her features were particularly beautiful, andshe hadn’t a drop of vanity.”

By the time of the pre-Broadway opening in Boston, on January 29, Melwas so outspoken in his hostility toward Lunt and so obsessed for his part(and apparently so unconcerned for Audrey’s status) that he threatened to quitthe play and take Audrey with him. “That wasn’t jealousy—that wasimbecility,” said Fontanne. All the while, Audrey wanted everything to gosmoothly—but she would do nothing to risk Mel’s anger.

At that point, Audrey took an early flight one morning from Boston toNew York, where she arrived unannounced at Sherwood’s apartment. On theverge of tears, she said she felt that she was really the source of the conflict,and she offered to withdraw from the play. Sherwood finessed the situationwith admirable diplomacy, restored Audrey’s confidence while scarcelymentioning Mel and sent her back to Boston with renewed confidence. Withthat, Sherwood sent a telegram to Lunt:

I HAVE HAD A VERY USEFUL AND SENSIBLE TALK WITHAUDREY HEPBURN AND AM GOING TO BOSTON TOMORROWSATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DISCUSS WITH YOU VALENCYAUDREY AND FERRER ANY POINTS THAT REMAIN INDOUBT…AUDREY SAID TO ME THAT SHE COULD ASKNOTHING BETTER FOR HER FUTURE CAREER THAN ALWAYSTO BE DIRECTED BY YOU AND I TAKE THAT STATEMENTLITERALLY AS EVIDENCE OF HER INTELLIGENCE.

The Boston reviews were rhapsodic, especially for Audrey. And to thesurprise of everyone in the production, there was no outcry from the press orthe audiences over her third-act appearance in a fishnet body stocking withstrategically placed faux seaweed: her costume gave an unmistakableimpression of nudity.

On February 18, Ondine opened in New York for a limited run, and thecritical superlatives for Audrey were almost unanimous. “Audrey Hepburngives a tremulously lovely performance,” wrote Brooks Atkinson in The NewYork Times.

Everyone knows that Miss Hepburn is an exquisite young lady, and noone has ever doubted her talent for acting. But the part of Ondine is acomplicated one. It is compounded of intangibles—of moods andimpressions, mischief and tragedy. Somehow Miss Hepburn is able totranslate them into the language of the theater without artfulness orprecociousness. She gives a pulsing performance that is all grace andenchantment, disciplined by an instinct for the realities of the stage.

The unnamed reviewer for The New Yorker agreed: “Miss Hepburn’s giftis such that everything she says and does has an almost irresistible charm.The frailest joke takes on an extra dimension of personality and becomeshilarious; the most perfunctory and obvious bit of business seems at themoment a brilliant acting inspiration.”

Mel did not fare nearly so well. “His playing is curiously uninteresting,”wrote Richard Watts, Jr., speaking for almost all his colleagues (except

Atkinson). “It lacks vividness, style and imagination almost completely,which is all the more distracting because these are the qualities that theproduction otherwise possesses so winningly. If Mr. Lunt were just a fewyears younger, how splendid he would have been in the part!”

Despite the vague poetics of the play and the harsh New York winter, therewas rarely a vacant seat at the 46th Street Theatre. Ten days after theopening, Atkinson wrote a second long, critical essay in praise of theproduction and the players and, apparently smitten, continued hiscanonization of the leading lady:

Miss Hepburn gives a magical performance as Ondine. She is arapturously beautiful young woman, but there is no self-consciousnessor vanity in her acting. Sprite-like in the spontaneity of her movement,quick, agile and bubbling, she describes Ondine’s ordeal in the humanworld with candor and grace. Under the enchantment, a keen mind is atwork. Ondine is not merely an entrancing creature but a vivid idea, andthe acting could hardly be more lucid or admirable.

However much he liked Audrey, Alfred Lunt agreed with critics likeWalter Kerr, who thought the production was a failure. But whereas Kerrobjected to the play’s “philosophical debris” and the oppressive weight of its“succession of speeches,” Lunt believed the fiasco was finally due to MelFerrer’s vulgarization of his scenes with Audrey. “Of course people aredisappointed in the love story,” he wrote to Robert E. Sherwood that spring.“She jumps on the hero’s lap and he holds her like a potted palm—he sitsbeside her at the table and treats her like a tired waitress. Listen, if he playedhis scenes on top of her, you’d have the feeling that he was laying acornerstone. Personally, I’d call the whole show a fucking failure.” And to awoman who asked if Lunt had learned anything from directing movie stars,he was quite blunt: “Yes, Madam. I learned that you cannot make a knight-errant out of a horse’s ass.”

When Lunt had departed New York and the critics turned to other tasks,the play had to continue on its own merit, and at that point, Mel lost allrestraint. At the most serious moments, he often took a prop and mimicked

Jerry Lewis, then a popular movie and television comic. If he could not takethis poetic fairy tale seriously, Marian Seldes wondered, why do it at all?Shamelessly stealing scenes and upstaging other players—Audrey included—he disallowed the solo curtain call that Lunt had prescribed for her. Mel camebefore the audience holding her hand, as if he knew the applause for his ownunaccompanied bow would have been far less fervent. It is doubtful that thishappened at Audrey’s insistence, for she would not have countered herdirector’s last instructions. Indeed, word of his astonishing imperiousnessmay have been relayed by the stage manager to Lunt at his Wisconsin home,for six weeks later, Audrey was taking solo curtain calls.

There were good reasons for Mel to capitulate. On March 25, Audrey wonthe Academy Award as best actress of the year 1953, for her performance inRoman Holiday; to this was added the equivalent award from the BritishAcademy of Film and Television Arts (and numerous tributes from lessaugust organizations). Three evenings later, she won the Antoinette Perry(“Tony”) Award for the best performance by an actress in a Broadway playthat season. (For the same production, Lunt was honored as best director,Richard Whorf best costume designer and Peter Larkin best scenic designer.)“I can’t allow [the awards] or all this public acclaim to turn my head,” shetold a journalist, “or induce me to ease up in working toward my life’sambition—to become a truly great actress.”

Mel gave every sign of pride and delight in her prizes; the Baroness vanHeemstra did not. “She came to the play,” Marian Seldes recalled, “andalthough she seemed to want to be the agent and manager of Audrey’s lifeand career, she was not warm or maternal at all. She was very correct,beautifully dressed and coiffed—but daunting, rather aloof andundemonstrative.” Such was the usual assessment of Ella over many decades.

Audrey’s success did not mean security. “It’s like when somebody givesyou something to wear that’s too big, and you have to grow into it,” she said.“I wouldn’t say I’ve learned to act yet. Often I think I’ll never learn anything.Some of the things I do onstage depress me beyond measure.” Indeed, as theseason continued, she became more nervous, even depressed, despite herawards, her celebrity and the gratifying offers pouring into the office of Kurt

Frings (formerly a lightweight boxing champion in Europe).*7 By April,Audrey was pale and shaky, and her smoking had increased from two to threepacks daily. The company doctor told The Playwrights Company he fearedshe might be headed for a complete physical and emotional breakdown.

The Oscar and the Tony were not an unmixed blessing: henceforth, everyAudrey Hepburn undertaking was expected to be hugely successful,commercially and artistically. Not yet twenty-five, she had attained a level ofaccomplishment toward which seasoned professionals often work for years oreven decades. How could she possibly sustain this height of achievement? Infact, she told members of The Playwrights Company that spring, she was sospent by the experience of Ondine that she would never appear in a playagain. She kept her word.

“There was enormous pressure on her, from the press and from Mel,”Marian Seldes remembered, “and despite the praise and affection showeredon her, there was a subtext of unhappiness in her life.” Seldes wrote Audrey anote, offering any kind of help, or just a friendly chat. Audrey repliedgratefully, signing her name with a drawing of the water sprite of the play—but she never confided in her colleagues.

The ongoing pressure from Mel now had to do with marriage, for he hadproposed and was pushing for a favorable reply; Audrey hesitated. At thesame time, reporters plied her about rumors of an impending wedding, but asusual she parried with generalities:

Marriage is like signing a long-term contract. Unless you know yourinnermost thoughts, you can’t give yourself to anyone. I’m still learningabout myself…I don’t know lots of things yet, but I will. That’s why Idon’t want to be tied down to one spot, or even to one man.

“She had given up Hanson,” said Seldes, “but she wasn’t ready for Mel.”Audrey’s mother, and her friends Anita Loos and Cathleen Nesbitt, stronglyadvised against marrying him.

As scheduled, the last performance of Ondine was given on July 3. At a

farewell party, the entire company noticed, with alarm, Audrey’s frail,distracted condition. She smoked one cigarette after another, had a hackingcough, her hands shook almost uncontrollably and she left the gathering aftera polite interval. Ten days later, with her mother and Mel, she left New Yorkfor a quiet refuge in Switzerland, far from the strains of New York and thestresses of Hollywood. When Sabrina was released in September, Audreywas not involved in promotional activities.

Her absence from public view was soon explained. In Bürgenstock,Switzerland, on the shores of Lake Lucerne, Audrey Hepburn married MelFerrer: a civil service was held in the town hall on Friday, September 24, andthere was a brief Protestant religious ceremony next day, in a privatethirteenth-century chapel. For the church service, she wore a white organdydress with a high, round neckline (designed by Givenchy) and a simplewreath of white flowers. Only a few of their friends were invited. Mel hadselected the picturesque town for its privacy, its cool, healthful air, its limitedaccess for the press and general public—and because he was working throughAugust and September in Italy, in a film called Proibito, which solved theirimmediate financial dilemma.

But her withdrawal from public life was not occasioned merely byplanning her wedding.

From late June in New York and throughout that summer in Europe,Audrey had endured what was then called a complete nervous breakdown—apopular but not a proper description of clinical depression. In her case, thequiet weeks in Switzerland did not immediately restore her energy noralleviate what Marian Seldes and others described as a kind of chronicunhappiness. Audrey slept long hours—sometimes an entire night and day— 一but that brought little refreshment, and then she could not sleep for anequivalent period. She ate well and then for days had no appetite at all. Likean anxious child, she had bitten her fingernails to the quick; she smokedincessantly and often wept uncontrollably, sometimes for no apparent reason.The baroness simply prescribed self-discipline and walks in the cool morningair. They had been through the war, she reminded her daughter: what had sheto be depressed about now?

A reply could not easily be given, but a young woman of Audrey’sexquisite sensitivity and physical fragility would eventually have foundalmost unendurable the demands of eight performances weekly for fivemonths, the crush of interviews surrounding her awards and honors, thefrenetic pace of social life imposed by the accident of fame and the generallack of privacy. In addition, there was the conflict over Mel, a zealous, self-appointed overseer of her career. When he visited from Italy for a day or twothat summer, he invariably came with a cache of plays and scripts for them toconsider, and he agreed with Ella that perhaps the best remedy for her illnesswas to return to work. For the remainder of the year, that would be out of thequestion.

By the time of her wedding, Audrey had improved, and she admitted to ajournalist friend that indeed she had suffered a “complete breakdown in NewYork,” from which she now felt she was emerging.

Because of Mel’s work schedule, their honeymoon was limited to threedays at a chalet. Then, on Tuesday, September 28, they traveled to Rome,where Mel returned to work. Besieged by paparazzi for details of thewedding, Mel was ready to answer until Audrey interrupted. “This is ourmarriage, not the public’s,” she said, ending the discussion.

The couple retreated to a rented villa near the seaside resort of Anzio,about thirty miles south of Rome; there, Audrey read scripts, tended a garden,looked after a menagerie of pets, supervised three servants, learned how tocook Italian specialties, wrote letters and hoped for an early pregnancy.

She accepted one invitation for a public appearance, and that was inAmsterdam, on November 2. To raise funds for Dutch war invalids, Audreyagreed to sign photographs of herself at a department store. She and Mel hadto flee the scene when the younger members of the crowd went wild,smashing showcases as they pushed and shoved to be near the movie star. Forseveral years to come, Audrey kept her promise that day, not to make anypublic appearance unless there was adequate planning, security and crowdcontrol. Meeting strangers was always awkward and difficult for her; fromthat day and for the rest of her life, it was also something that threw her into

DURING THE RUN of Ondine, Audrey and Mel were visited backstage byMichael Powell, whose partnership with Emeric Pressburger had brought tothe screen The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus, among other impressivepostwar British films. “She was whole-hearted in her love for him,” Powellsaid of Audrey and Mel—“the kind of woman who gives all or nothing. Idon’t know how he lit this torch, but by heaven it flamed.”

Powell had the idea to make a film of Ondine—but one based on the LaMotte-Fouqué fairy tale, which was in the public domain (not on theGiraudoux play, whose movie rights would have to be purchased). “Theysnatched at the idea,” according to Powell, who also invited Mel to appearearly the following year in a film version of Die Fledermaus, called Oh—Rosalinda!! (The film was made, to no great or enduring life.) Powell’s ideafor Ondine had everything to do with Audrey: Mel, he thought, had none ofthe charisma of Louis Jouvet, the original Hans in the 1939 Paris production.“When Jouvet paused, we all paused. When Mel paused, the play stopped. Itwas Audrey, in spite of her small voice in that big theater, who carried theplay.”

In Rome that November, Powell and Pressburger visited Audrey and Melat their villa to plan Ondine, for which the actors had been promised a veryhandsome salary. They had a merry dinner, and the guests were shown toquarters. Next morning, they all set to the task. “We talked, wrote andworked,” Powell continued, “continually interrupted by telephone calls andhysterical servants. Audrey and Mel were, amiably, the worst listeners in theworld. They were always wandering off in the middle of a sentence, and noneof us allowed any of the others to finish one.”

As they developed the scenario, Powell recalled,

Mel was beginning to declare himself, and his tactics were only tooobvious: the play, the play and nothing but the play [he insisted].

Somehow every idea, every scene, became inextricably bound up withthe play, and Mel was the knight in shining armor defending Ondine,defending it from rape and disaster at [our] devilish hands. Audreylooked at him adoringly. There had obviously been extended pillow-talkthroughout the night…Fortunately the knight and his water-spritewandered away and gave Emeric time to collect his thoughts: “Theydon’t seem to know the difference between a play and a film.”

“Of course they don’t [Powell replied]. They’re actors. They’velearned the part and spoken the words to an audience, and it worked.They think that’s all there is to it. We have to educate them.”

The hosts returned, and Pressburger began a brilliant exposition of his ideafor the film, emphasizing that the screenplay was based on La Motte-Fouquéand not on Giraudoux. “Mel could see his most cherished lines tumbling intothe basket…Audrey’s hand crept into Mel’s and stayed there.” WhenPressburger was finished, they all went for a walk in the hills, and the subjectof conversation changed. Mel and Audrey had invited two other couples tojoin the group for the evening—producer Dino de Laurentiis and his wife,actress Silvana Mangano; and producer Carlo Ponti with Sophia Loren,whom he was to marry.

During dinner, the telephone rang. Paramount Pictures had agreed tofinance more than half of the film of Ondine, provided that Mel and Audrey,Powell and Pressburger put half their salaries in escrow until the pictureturned a profit. And then Mel said something odd: he advised the producersto negotiate with Giraudoux’s widow for film rights to the play.

“He still wants to make a photographed version of the play,” Pressburgersaid to Powell as they traveled to Paris next day. “That is why you have tosee [Madame Giraudoux]. If he could afford to buy the rights himself, hewould. With a film of the play, he would be sure of himself and Audrey,[and] that is why he wants us to buy the rights for him, so that he can cut ourbloody throats.”

Their train sped through the Alps, and Pressburger came up with an idea:to transform the myth of Ondine into a modern-dress movie, set in Monte

Carlo. They would replace the medieval dukes, knights and kings withmillionaires, racketeers and scuba divers, gamblers and fading film stars.There would be dramatic underwater photography and all sorts of cinematictricks. But in Paris, Madame Giraudoux made hilariously inflated demandsfor the screen rights to her late husband’s play, and the producers politelydeparted without a deal, which was fine so far as they were concerned. Theyhad tried to do Mel’s bidding, but Madame had been the flounder, not thesprite, in the sea.

Audrey and Mel arrived in London on December 31, 1954—to further thediscussions on Ondine and for Mel to begin acting in Oh—Rosalinda!!Powell and Pressburger joined them for a New Year’s Eve party at Ella’s flatin South Audley Street. “The baroness was a bit stiff,” Powell recalled, andhe left the party before midnight.

On the last day Mel worked on Oh—Rosalinda!!, he, Audrey, Powell andPressburger met at the studios of Hein Heckroth, the producers’ productiondesigner. Mel said, speaking for two, that he and Audrey were not pleasedwith the costumes: he also wanted a completely new approach to the storyand the design of the picture—he wished, in other words, to film the play.“We realized that Mel had been leading up to this for months and was nowcoming in for the kill,” according to Powell. “He was acting the part ofproducer.” And that was the end of the project.

On February 4, Audrey went to Paris for the French premiere of Sabrina,planned to coincide with “collection week,” when the forthcomingspring/summer fashions were presented by the couturier houses.

Paramount’s French offices, where Gallic ingenuity joined Americanmarketing genius, drummed up all sorts of advertising plans. For one thing,the studio offered prizes to any mother who gave birth to a girl on the day thefilm began its Paris run and named the baby Sabrina. Then a contest washeld, for a cash reward, in which young women believed they couldaffirmatively reply to the question “Do You Look Like Sabrina?” Next,record albums with the songs from the picture were displayed in shopwindows. The high point of all this revelry was the appearance of Audrey

herself, safely cordoned off and kept at some distance from journalists, whoanswered some polite questions during a press conference at the Ritz Hotel; itwas a scene lifted from the final moments of Roman Holiday. That samemonth, Audrey was nominated for an Academy Award as best actress forSabrina; Grace Kelly won, for The Country Girl.

In March—just weeks after learning the wonderful news that she waspregnant—Audrey suffered a miscarriage. “That was the closest I came tofeeling like I was going to lose my mind,” she said years later.

# Chapter Eight

1955–1956

IN EARLY 1955, Audrey and Mel signed a long lease on a three-story countryhouse in Switzerland called Villa Bethania, near Bürgenstock, high on ahilltop overlooking Lake Lucerne. As it happened, they spent almost no timethere that year.

During a brief holiday at St. Moritz that April, the Ferrers met with theAmerican film director King Vidor, who had made sixty-one movies, amongthem The Big Parade, The Crowd and Duel in the Sun. Just when Audrey andMel invited Carlo Ponti and Dino de Laurentiis to join Powell andPressburger for dinner, Vidor was concluding negotiations with Paramount,and those two Italian producers, for an epic production of Tolstoy’s novelWar and Peace. By late March, the project was being hastily prepared, whiletwo similar plans (by David O. Selznick and by Mike Todd) were forthwithabandoned.

Ponti and de Laurentiis had seen Mel’s film Proibito and told Vidor that hewould perhaps be right for the role of Prince Andrei. This was a shrewdmove: with Mel’s influence on Audrey, she would certainly accept the role ofNatasha, around whom develops the moral and psychological focus of thestory. She was happy for Mel’s employment, but she never shared hisambition—indeed, she would have been content to live quietly at home aswife and, she hoped, mother.

“Audrey’s career always came second,” said Henry Rogers, who that yearbecame her publicist and a good friend.

She never had the burning desire to become and remain a movie star, asdo most actresses, but instead cared only for personal happiness, peace,love, her children, a husband whom she loved and who loved her…Although she loved acting, she wanted to work less and spend more timein private…She was filled with love, [but] Mel was filled with ambition,for his wife and for himself.

It had been Mel’s idea to engage Rogers, but when the publicist arrangedinterviews and magazine features, “she was uncomfortable [and] alwaysbridled whenever I mentioned the need for an interview to be done, or aphoto session. I tried not to push her into a lot of publicity activity, realizingthat she considered it to be an unpleasant chore.” Selecting only crucialpublicity activities for her, Rogers always felt in an awkward positionbetween the spouses—caught “between Mel’s insatiable desire for Audrey’snew publicity and her reluctance to give interviews or pose for photographs.”

Like Marian Seldes and others who knew and worked with Audrey, Rogersadded, “Rarely did I ever see her happy.” Perhaps unaware of her childhoodmisfortunes, her extreme sensitivity and her recent miscarriage that year, herecognized only one basis for her despondency—a misconceived marriage:

It was no secret that her marriage to Mel was not a happy one. It seemedto me that she loved him more than he loved her, and it was frustratingfor her not to have her love returned in kind. She had confided thesefeelings to me and a number of other intimate friends many times. Shenever complained, but I always saw the sadness in her eyes…During theyears she was married to Mel, she was Trilby to his Svengali.

That allusion may have overstated the case, but it was an impression heldby many who knew them; there can be, after all, a fine line betweenmentorship and domination. In this regard, Audrey’s marriage confirmed herin a relationship with a man like James Hanson, who (unlike Mel) had noconnection to or understanding of the movie world at all, yet whocapriciously inserted himself into the scheduling of Roman Holiday andusurped the role of managing agent and producer. Hanson’s manipulativemanner effectively earned his dismissal from her life—an action that was

now unimaginable in the case of her husband.

Mel Ferrer never exerted the sinister, hypnotic influence over Audrey thatthe Hungarian musician Svengali wielded over the young singer (in Georgedu Maurier’s novel Trilby). And Mel’s intentions were certainly benevolent.But remarkably often, her cause coincided with his own best advantage. Itseemed never to have occurred to him that their deepest aspirations were, inthe final analysis, incompatible.

“I had the feeling that Audrey needed somebody to make her decisions forher,” said Vidor. “He did all the talking for her. He knows what is right forher. He knows how much money she should be getting. I believe he collectedher salary personally.”

AND SO, ESSENTIALLY for her husband’s sake, but also because they needed themoney, Audrey capitulated and agreed to play the role of Natasha. With noresistance from the producers, Kurt Frings quickly obtained for her a salaryof $350,000 plus an expense allowance of $\$ 500$ weekly—the highest fee paidto any actress in the world and thirty times her payment for Sabrina. (Melwas to receive $100,000.) “I’m not worth it—it’s impossible!” she said toFrings. “Please don’t tell anyone!” But the deal was as much to her agent’sadvantage as to hers, and he announced it all over Hollywood. At once, thepress was trumpeting her historic fee and she was receiving messages ofcongratulations—first, from Henry Fonda, who had been signed to playPierre, Natasha’s true love. Fonda was fifty years old.

Audrey’s reaction to the news did not spring from false modesty. Shealways considered herself an apprentice and had no high estimation of thegifts that were being refined by experience, by earnest preparation and bygravity of purpose. She knew she was fortunate to be offered good roles inpremium movies and was aware that she was not easy to cast: she had neitherthe opulent figure nor the demeanor—and certainly not the desire—to playthe sexy protagonists of that time. Nor had she the age or eccentricity forcharacter roles.

A fresh type with a unique look and an elegance of which audiences might

grow weary, Audrey felt that she must prove herself anew with eachundertaking. And with two performances nominated by the Academy and oneawarded, she knew she would be more critically assessed by critics andproducers than many of her colleagues. That spring, she turned twenty-six,and she often wondered if her career had any further to go. This was not adepressing thought, for the business was never her priority. She would choosecarefully, or she would not choose at all.

At that point, the Ferrers applied for and received permanent residency inSwitzerland, which offered major tax advantages: had he continued to file areturn in America and she to pay British revenues, they would have forfeitedninety percent of their income.

THE PROBLEMS ON Sabrina were due to clashing personalities and ornerytemperaments; those on War and Peace were logistical. With lavish designson paper, but no script in hand, Ponti and de Laurentiis nevertheless insistedthat filming begin on July 1, with exteriors to be shot in Italy and Yugoslaviaand interiors in Rome. Vidor immediately had to supervise the completion ofcasting more than fifty speaking roles, while fifteen thousand extras wereoutfitted in period costumes made by ninety tailors working around the clock;in addition, animal trainers from all over Europe were summoned to providemore than eight thousand horses; and 2,876 cannons were hauled out oftheatrical storage and military museums. The producers urged Vidor and hiscameraman, Jack Cardiff, to remain calm, for they had (they said) aningenious method of having a screenplay finished in record time.

Their ingenuity was as reckless and unrealistic as the start date. To Vidor’sastonishment, Ponti and de Laurentiis took a translation of Tolstoy’sfourteen-hundred-page novel about Napoleon’s assault on Russia, cut it intoequal segments like so many wedges of Italian sausage and assigned eachslice to a different team of Roman writers. Demanding that each complete hissection within three weeks, the producers then hauled the result—ecco fatto!— into Vidor’s office. The result was a script wildly uneven in tone,inconsistent in character development and lacking anything like a coherent

viewpoint.

The length of a typical screenplay is from about 100 to 130 pages: the firstdraft of War and Peace was 506 pages. Paramount, nervous about theschedule and eager to recoup its $\$ 6$ million outlay, rubber-stamped itsapproval of the vast text, but Vidor was horrified when he glanced at theunshootable tangle of pages. He put the script in a drawer, summoned thewriters Bridget Boland, Robert Westerby and Irwin Shaw and began the taskanew, pledging to transform the novel into a film in weeks. That they did notcollapse under the strain is nothing short of astounding.

The producers wanted an epic to end all epics; that was understandable in1955, when moviemakers were in a collective panic over the massivedefection of audiences to television. Hollywood responded with aproliferation of Technicolor, stereophonic sound and Cinerama; wide-screenprocesses like CinemaScope and VistaVision; gimmicks like 3-D; and amercifully short-lived contraption variously called Smell-O-Vision andAromaRama. Long movies with casts of thousands and eye-catchingsequences, like The Robe, Demetrius and the Gladiators, The TenCommandments, The Greatest Show on Earth, Around the World in 80 Daysand Ben-Hur were calculated to offer moviegoers the sweep, scale and hint oferoticism that television, in that stricter era, could not.

In this commercial rush for spectacle, the result was often merelyexpensive, mammoth, colorized, loud, big-screen tedium. Over time, thisdevelopment led to a profusion of computerized fantasies and action movies,violent assaults on eye, ear and intelligence. This was not always progress, ashuman stories with adult dilemmas and sensibilities were gradually sacrificedto court a younger audience; meanwhile, grown-ups (as Samuel Goldwynsaid in another context) began to stay away from the movies in droves. In1955, this was an evolution in its first stages, and that spring, Vidor did whathe was being paid to do: he tried to come up with a saga of majestic grandeur.The odds were against him from the beginning.

A grand and enduring portrait of the Russian soul, Tolstoy’s novel is amonumental work in which historical and philosophical themes are explored

through an enormous variety of more than five hundred characters from everysocial level. Part of the author’s genius was his management of all this in astory of striking vibrancy and emotional authenticity; the movie, on the otherhand, became an assemblage of expeditions, extended battle sequences andstrategic military conferences, occasionally and ineffectively interrupted bycharacters with very little recognizable sentiment. Even the chronologyseemed confusing.

Great hopes to the contrary, and the continuing attempts of Vidornotwithstanding, War and Peace reached the screen as three and a half hoursof empty spectacle. “Oddly mechanical and emotionally sterile,” was thecritical consensus, “[and] the characters seem second-rate people, hackneyedand without much depth…The human stories are sketchy andinconsequential.” Audrey, in an underwritten and unmotivated role, could notescape criticism, too: “She goes from smiling innocence to tearfulinnocence,” wrote a senior London critic, lamenting that both character andactress seemed not to mature, which was much the point of the novel. Still,no less a group than the New York Film Critics Circle nominated her as thebest actress of the year. (Ingrid Bergman won, for Anastasia.)

Filming lasted from July to November, and the conditions werepersistently uncomfortable. Amid the stifling heat of the Italian summer, tonsof artificial snow were brought in for the scenes of the wintry marches, whileAudrey and her colleagues smothered under heavy gowns and furs; even thestudio interiors were unpleasant places, for the air conditioning at Cinecittàwas erratic at best and often inoperative. Despite the exhaustion of ten-hourworkdays, Audrey was a serene presence to whom the entire company lookedfor encouragement. Few noticed that her serenity masked constant anxiety forher performance.

The ball sequence, for example, with its many setups over several days,required her to appear romantically energetic during a long and complex shot.Audrey rose to the occasion with an unfailing patience that impressed herdirector. “It was of course inconceivable to have anyone other than AudreyHepburn as Natasha,” said Vidor at the time. “She has a rhythmic grace thatis a director’s delight.” There was never a cross word between them, which

could not be said of his collaboration with her male co-stars. Both menseemed gloomily inappropriate in their roles: Fonda played Pierre asdepressed instead of introspective, while Ferrer—whose eyes were notablyexpressionless—recited his lines flatly and, wearing period costumes,somehow managed to look absurd instead of impressive.

For all her docility and politesse, Audrey could be stubborn. During theballroom sequence, for example, she wore a low-cut gown that revealed herclavicle, upper ribs and hyoid bone. “She really had no breasts—she was amodel and very thin,” recalled Cardiff. “I suggested she wear a necklace orsomething with this low-cut dress, but she said, ‘Jack, I’m just me. I am whatI am, and I haven’t done too badly like this.’” Cardiff was anxious about thescene “because you could really see her ribs.” So could de Laurentiis, whowas infuriated with the result, but by that time, the sequence had been filmedand the set dismantled. “She was very silly,” Cardiff concluded, “becausethere was no need to accentuate her ribs.”

THE FERRERS COMPLETED their roles in War and Peace in late November andthen proceeded to Paris, where they took a suite at the Hôtel Raphaël. Melimmediately went to his next job—a role in Eléna et les hommes, starringIngrid Bergman and directed by Jean Renoir. On February 27, 1956, a monthbefore he finished working, Audrey traveled alone to Los Angeles. Tiredthough she was, she had been offered an opportunity she could not reject—tosing and dance with no less a partner than Fred Astaire, in a romantic musicalcalled Funny Face. It was certainly a fine script, and it would be her finestperformance since Roman Holiday. Despite the fact that it was anotherCinderella story with a fragile narrative and one-dimensional characters,Funny Face retains a naïve charm and, half a century later, remains one of themost inventive, colorful and lively movies of the 1950s. But it almost did nothappen, and it was not produced easily.

In 1951, screenwriter Leonard Gershe had completed the libretto for aBroadway musical called Wedding Day, with book and lyrics by Ogden Nashand music by Vernon Duke. The work remained unproduced, and Gershe

sold his story rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. There, producer andcomposer Roger Edens—who had won the Academy Award in 1948, 1949and 1950 (for scoring Easter Parade, On the Town and Annie Get Your Gun)—had a superb reputation for producing extravagant and appealing musicals.

Edens and Gershe decided to abandon the Nash-Duke contributions and tosubstitute popular songs by George and Ira Gershwin. Turning first to the1927 Broadway show Funny Face (which had starred none other than FredAstaire and his sister Adele), they took its title, the title song and four othernumbers but ignored the original story in favor of Wedding Day. (In 1927,Funny Face had been Astaire’s suggestion for both the song title and thename of the show; it was his nickname for his dancing partner, Adele.)

To direct the hybrid project, Edens and Gershe easily interested StanleyDonen, who was responsible for the success of (among other musicals)Singin’ in the Rain and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers; this team set abouttransforming Wedding Day into an MGM project.

The completed screenplay was several things: both a satire and anendorsement of high fashion (perhaps only a Hollywood movie can have itboth ways); a spoof of the coffeehouse “beatnik” intellectualism popular inthe 1950s; and a tribute to the genius of photographer Richard Avedon. Thestory told of Dick Avery (Astaire), hired to use his cameras in service to theeditor of Quality magazine (Kay Thompson). Jo Stockton (Audrey), a plainlyclad, somewhat naïve Greenwich Village bookstore clerk with a fondness fora social philosophy known as “empathicalism,” is selected to be transformedinto a high-fashion model for the coming season—“she’s new, she’s fresh,”says Dick. Whisked off to Paris, she is (thanks to Givenchy) changed into astunning runway mannequin, and—are we surprised?—she falls in love withDick, who belatedly responds.

This thin premise was punctuated with stylishly inventive scenes thatinvariably succeed, thanks to Givenchy’s designs; Avedon’s clever,multicolored fashion photography, seamlessly woven into the story; andamiable song-and-dance sequences. These latter were variously droll (“ThinkPink,” which imagines the women of the world outfitted in clothes that seem

dyed in Pepto-Bismol); touchingly wistful (“How Long Has This Been GoingOn?” and “He Loves and She Loves”); and romantically old-fashioned (thetitle song and “’S Wonderful”). Because the romantic heart of the story is setin Paris, the movie had ample opportunity for a colorful tour of sites such asthe Opéra, Montmartre, Notre Dame, the Place de la Concorde, the Tuileriesgardens and the Eiffel Tower (the final location for the snappy musicalnumber in which the leading trio dart about the city singing “Bonjour,Paris”).

THE PROJECT’S CREATIVE TEAM, presuming from the start that Fred Astairewould rush to sign a contract if he was told that Audrey Hepburn was readyto join, prepared the script specifically for him. Fresh from his latest hits (TheBand Wagon and Daddy Long Legs), Astaire would be making his twenty-eighth film since Flying Down to Rio almost twenty-five years earlier. Tosecure his participation, the producers resorted to a traditional, if somewhatdisreputable, Hollywood maneuver.

Gershe’s new screenplay had been submitted to Kurt Frings, who waslegally obliged to send it on to Audrey in Paris. But after he sat down with hiscopy of the text, Frings said that it was trash and that he would advise hisclient not to do it. Audrey, however, read it during her Christmas holiday,loved it, said so to Frings and eagerly signaled her willingness—especially(and here was the ruse) when the producers told her they had signed FredAstaire, which they had not. As a matter of fact, they had gone to FredAstaire at precisely the same time, informing him that they already hadAudrey—which they had not. This was risky business, and on the shady sideof ethical, but in this case the stratagem worked.

Astaire and Hepburn were now aboard, but other complications arose. Forone thing, Audrey was under contract to Paramount, which refused to loanher out to Metro; for another, the rights to the Gershwin score were owned byWarner Bros. Tricky negotiations continued daily from November throughFebruary, and finally Warner sold the song rights for a hefty sum to Metro,which in turn set up the package of Roger Edens, Leonard Gershe, Stanley

Donen, Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn and sold the project to Paramount.Besides a truckload of cash, MGM also got the right to use Audrey for apicture of their own within three years.

After two months of vocal and dance rehearsals, and recording sessions ofthe songs (which the actors would silently mime during playback on the set),filming began at the Paramount studios in Los Angeles in April 1956. InMel’s absence, Audrey demonstrated a strength and determination not alwaysevident when he was there. She had, for example, definite ideas for eachscene—almost all of them welcomed by her director.

Only one sequence occasioned a dispute. For her long and complex dancenumber set in a Paris café, Audrey was to wear a black sweater and blackleotards; to this outfit, she wanted to add black ballet slippers without socks.No, countered Donen, the effect of your dancing will be much diminished—he preferred that she wear white socks, the better to highlight her intricatesteps against the dark, smoky background. This was her only dance numberwithout Astaire, and he wanted viewers to see her every move.

Audrey was astonished. “Absolutely not!” she cried. “It will spoil thewhole black silhouette and cut the line at my feet!”

“If you don’t wear the white socks,” Donen replied calmly,

“you will fade into the background, there will be no definition to yourmovement and the dance sequence will be bland and dull.”

She burst into tears and ran to her dressing room but later regained hercomposure, wore the white socks, returned to the set and continued. Afterseeing the rough cut of the sequence, she wrote Donen a note: “You wereright about the socks—Love, Audrey.”

“Audrey was very serious,” according to Kay Thompson. “The poor thingwas doing something monumental in a hurry. Fortunately, the songs wereperfect for her.” She sang “How Long Has This Been Going On?” in her thin,slightly tremulous mezzo—a timbre that could never fill a theater, but herrendition was surprisingly affecting. For once, the audience understands that

the question refers not to a romance in progress, but to the sudden rush ofromantic feelings that a simple kiss stirs up.

AS THE CAST continued their long workdays that spring, Audrey marked hertwenty-seventh birthday—and Fred Astaire his fifty-seventh. A curiouspattern was emerging, and one with few counterparts in Hollywood history:for the third time, this young actress was paired with a leading man oldenough to be her father. The situation was very like the tradition of medievaland Renaissance religious art, in which the youthful Virgin Mary isrepresented alongside her husband, Joseph—represented as a venerable oldman, bearded and avuncular. The relationship, therefore, seemed chaste, freeof the taint of carnal congress.

This is precisely why the image of Audrey Hepburn in films is strangelyunerotic—not because she is undesirable or aloof, but because she was sooften shown with much older men who seemed incapable of matching herexuberant energies (thus far, Bogart, Fonda and Astaire—later, and more tothe point, Gary Cooper).*8 Only when Audrey was past her twenties andaudiences demanded just a bit more sensuality (if not sexuality) was she castwith Albert Finney, Peter O’Toole and Sean Connery. If she had anythoughts about the older men and the egregious lack of onscreen heat, shenever expressed them—to do so, she may have thought, would have beenoffensive to the actors.

In Audrey’s case, she was presented as something of a stained-glasswindow figure, radically different in face, voice and form from (for example)Marilyn Monroe and the opulent stars of the day. With Gregory Peck, thethwarted romance was credible because he, too, was never a sex symbol inthe movies. It was almost impossible to imagine her in a passionate embracewith Bogart, Fonda or Astaire—even their kisses seemed perfunctory.

Billy Wilder may have sensed this conundrum, for he had ignored afundamental rule of romantic moviemaking in the last shot of Sabrina,aboard the ship bound for Paris. The embrace of Hepburn and Bogart was

photographed not in close-up, nor even in a medium shot, but with thecamera several meters away. For once in this movie, the director seems toagree with us: Hepburn and Bogart are literally incredible together—they donot inhabit an intimate space, they are figures in a seascape, remote from usand one another. Indeed, the image of them as a couple is franklydisagreeable, and Wilder (always the cynic) may have wondered if theromance was doomed. We see them from a distance; there is nothing withwhich we are invited to identify.

In Fred Astaire’s career, his persona was perhaps best summed up by thefamous trick sequence in Donen’s Royal Wedding, in which Astaire calmly,joyfully seemed to cover the floor, walls and ceiling of a furnished room withgravity-defying steps. That scene perfectly illustrates our perception of hisplace in the universe: he seemed to exist above natural man. His was the formof a medieval saint, too: there was nothing erotic or even sensual about him.In each of his films, his dancing partners, to shift the metaphor, were his fairygoddaughters. And his deportment always suggested that he was, in some oddway, beyond mere physicality: Fred Astaire was a gentleman up there on thescreen—so much a gentleman, in fact, that there was never an atom of eroticappeal about him. That is precisely why the final shots of Funny Facesucceed so well, as Fred and Audrey literally float downstream in the forestof Chantilly, photographed in a haze of diffused light and attended by snow-white doves and swans. This is the stuff of sheer Hollywood fairy tale, and ithas its own charm. But it is so calculated that there is something oddlyantiseptic about it—there is, in other words, nothing to take seriously.

Astaire was always a kind of Peter Pan, ignoring the physical laws of theuniverse: he strode, he leaped and he tapped his way through movies, and inFunny Face, Audrey was his Tinker Bell. Watching him, it looked easy toovercome the burden of the body, and he did what (it seemed) could not bedone. One of the enduring images of his career is the final shot of The Storyof Vernon and Irene Castle, in which he and Ginger Rogers cakewalk intoeternity. Visually, it is (as Ben Hecht would have said) a lot of hooey; it isalso irresistible.

THE FAIRY TALE existed only on the screen.

From the first day of filming, Audrey was in awe of Astaire and workeddouble-time to please him. For his part, he resented the love she at onceevoked from the director, the crew and the other actors. He knew that theproduction team would hasten to please her, because, as he said, “Audrey is alady who gets her way.”

Once filming began, Astaire became anxious about their age difference andhence the credibility of the romance: the idea of appearing with Audrey hadbeen irresistible, but now reality intervened. She looked younger than herage, and he felt older than his. When the cast members greeted one anotherwarmly each morning and gathered collegially around Donen for coffee andchatter, Astaire arrived and was noticeably irritable. “What do you want meto do?” he asked Donen brusquely, or “What is he [or she] doing over there?”

In fact, Astaire (not Donen) interrupted his dances with Audrey severaltimes during filming. “What are you doing?” he asked her in a loud, irritablevoice. “Fred was impatient,” according to Kay Thompson, “and he wanted tobe great in front of Audrey. Those scenes at Chantilly, of Fred and Audreycrossing the water on a little raft—Fred stopped her four or five times right inthe middle of the scene and said, ‘What are you doing?’ After Fred had yelledat Audrey a couple of times…finally the scene was over.” Later that evening,Audrey confided to Kay that she found her work with Fred “a bit of astrain”—something to which she never publicly alluded.

The entire company happily anticipated filming the exterior locations forFunny Face that summer. But in Paris, things could not have been morefrustrating. Rain drenched the city and environs day after day, and even aslight pause in the downpours had to be fiercely seized despite dark clouds,for time and money were at stake. A scene in the Tuileries, for example, wasobviously photographed during a rainy interval, but Donen had to make avirtue of necessity. The weather did not improve Astaire’s disposition.

As for Audrey, the work in Europe was her caviar, for she was alwaysmore comfortable there than in Hollywood. Delicate and droll in the NewYork sequences of Funny Face, she did not, however, seem entirely naturalin the burlap-and-corduroy informality of Greenwich Village. She was moresuitable for Paris, and Hollywood knew it: part or all of six Hepburn filmswere made there or at least located there.*9

Ella came from London to Paris to watch some of the filming. “She hadgreat humor and so did Audrey,” recalled Leonard Gershe, who took thebaroness for a drink and befriended her that summer.

But unfortunately, they didn’t have it together—they didn’t sharelaughs. I adored her mother, but Audrey didn’t like her very much…Ellaplayed the role of stern mother. She was a different person when shetalked about Audrey—judgmental—and she took her role of baronessquite seriously. On the other hand, Ella could be very silly when shewanted to be, and so could Audrey. But Audrey never knew that woman.They didn’t know they were really very alike.

Although Ella believed that her daughter was a wonderful actress, Gershecontinued,

She couldn’t tell her that. Audrey once told me that she never felt lovedby her mother, but Ella did love her, believe me. Often people can’t tellthe object of their love that they love them; they’ll tell other peopleinstead. I probably would have hated Ella as a mother—but I loved heras a friend.

Audrey completed Funny Face in late July. She had a few weeks’ holidaywith Mel in Bürgenstock before he took on two consecutive roles thatrequired him to work in Spain and France. At the same time, Audreyaccepted an offer to work again with director Billy Wilder, on condition thatthe film be made entirely in Paris, where she and Mel could be reunited onweekends. Wilder sold her on the picture before she read the finishedscreenplay by informing her that Gary Cooper, for many years America’smovie ideal of the dutiful, ordinary man, was to be her co-star; again, Cary

Grant had rejected Wilder’s bid.

Love in the Afternoon, based on a novel by Claude Anet, was about awealthy, aging American businessman and Don Juan named Flannagan(Cooper) who, without feeling or conscience, pursues affairs with womenaround the world; he has, thus far, successfully avoided marriage. In Paris,his indiscretions provide work for a private detective (Maurice Chevalier),who has a virginal daughter named Ariane (Hepburn), a music student. Atfirst, she is fascinated by his exploits; then, she falls in love with him and, toconvince him that she is a worldly woman, invents a history of her ownlovers. Finally, Flannagan can no longer ignore his attraction to Ariane.Leaving Paris, he is about to abandon her on the train platform but thensweeps her up into his arms.

Tall, rangy, laconic, shy and full of a sex appeal of which he was (onlyapparently) unaware, Cooper was the most enduringly popular Americanmale star for almost thirty years. In 1956, he was fifty-five but looked morethan a decade older. After Grant had rejected the role, Wilder—with typicalperversity—chose Cooper for the unappealing role of an incurablewomanizer. Still married to his only wife, Cooper was nevertheless a busybee who buzzed from one Hollywood flower to another over many years: hislovers included (among others) Lupe Velez, Barbara Stan-wyck, MerleOberon, Carole Lombard, Paulette Goddard, Marlene Dietrich, IngridBergman and Clara Bow.

Before she began work on the new picture that September, however,Audrey traveled from Paris to New York, to see her friend Cathleen Nesbittin the musical My Fair Lady, starring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison.“What Audrey is hoping for,” reported Edwin Schallert of the Los AngelesTimes after speaking with her, “is that her husband, Mel Ferrer, will play theprofessor and she the cockney heroine—a striking contrast to their worktogether in War and Peace.”

Returning to Paris, she greeted Wilder, and prepared for Love in theAfternoon. Gratitude to him for the success he had provided in Sabrina mayhave been Audrey’s primary motivation in agreeing to this picture: given her

care in selecting scripts and her stated desire for a variety of roles, it isotherwise difficult to understand what might have been persuasive reasonsnot to do it. Indeed, with this movie, critics and audiences were finallybecoming impatient with the casting of much older men opposite her; for thefirst time, and despite her wardrobe by Givenchy, Audrey’s appearanceseemed statuesque, nearly frozen into a kind of blank perfection. Indeed,Ariane’s clothes should have been selected off the rack—or designed as ifthey were; instead, they are almost hilariously unsuitable, far too opulent foran unemployed student whose father struggles along as a private detective.

From the start of production that autumn, in the studios just west of centralParis, Wilder had a serious technical problem that could never be resolved.Although he had supervised makeup and wardrobe tests with the male lead,Cooper’s status had made those tests little more than a formality. But whenhe arrived for the job, the actor unwittingly brought Wilder and hiscameraman a depressing reality. No matter how heavy the cosmetics, nomatter how carefully the lights were arranged and rearranged, Gary Cooperappeared a haggard old man, angry at the emptiness of his life and ravaged byindulgence. This had been the problem with Bogart in Sabrina, but now therewere extended love scenes, and love scenes cannot always be rendered from adistance.

What to do? Filters were placed on the camera, but that was insufficient.And so, for almost every shot in which his face appears in close-up, GaryCooper had to be photographed in deep shadow, or from behind, or throughgauze, or partly obscured by a prop or a wall, a curtain or a door. Fifty yearslater, some aesthetes strain for meaning in all this subterfuge, seeing thedesperate measures as the perfect metaphor for Flannagan’s character. Wilderalways had contempt for such excuses, and in any case they would have beenentirely inappropriate for what was intended to be a comedy. As for Cooper,this was the ninety-ninth picture he made since his silent-movie debut in1925—hence his experience told him precisely what was happening when hisscenes required numerous setups and there was continued muttering behindthe camera. More and more uncomfortable in the role, he always looked (asone of his biographers wrote) as if his shirt collar was too tight. Cooper hadturned his standard of unexpressive, almost monotonic line-readings to his

best advantage over the years; this distinctive quality was no help to him inthis case.

“He and Billy Wilder were connoisseurs,” Audrey said later of her co-star.“They talked about food and wine and clothes and art. I was never includedin their rapport. I have the greatest respect for Mr. Wilder, but I don’t knowhim personally really well. I couldn’t speak with him in the way I could withKing [Vidor].” And so, in addition to the awkwardness between the leadingplayers, Audrey now felt that she had lost her earlier, easier association withthis director; predictably, that, too, affected her own performance.

Wilder’s stated intention with Love in the Afternoon was to honor hismentor, the filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch, who had been such a splendid satirist;instead, this comedy is about as amusing as Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard,which is to say not at all. Bleak and melancholic, it has an unappealingpremise that seems only more disturbing with the passage of time. With arunning time of two hours and ten minutes, it seems more like four hours;utterly lacking narrative crispness, storytelling economy or romanticcredibility, it is difficult to believe that it came from Billy Wilder and wasboth created and advertised as a charming romantic comedy.

In addition to the miscast Cooper, the problems with the movie accumulatefrom the first scenes, in which every bit of exposition is repeated three times—a device that continues throughout the film. Rendering everything moretedious still is the presence, in scene after scene, of an unsmiling quartet ofmusicians playing “Fascination.” They were intended as comic relief, buttheir presence simply stops the film.

Like few other movies, Love in the Afternoon makes romantic rendezvousseem joyless and dispiriting. And it is difficult to appreciate the creation ofthe character of Ariane (by Wilder and his co-writer, I.A.L. Diamond) as avirginal student, devoted only to her cello and ignorant of romance. A girlwith the looks of Audrey Hepburn? in Paris? in 1956? and not in a convent?

The deepest problem, however, is Ariane’s attraction to the scoundrelFlannagan, a man who exploits and discards women. Why is this clever,

sensitive girl drawn to an aging lothario who cares so little for women that heboasts of forgetting their names? The film comes close to presentingAriane/Audrey as little more than a masochist straight from the pages of Lesliaisons dangéreuses.

When the film was released in 1957, audiences loved Audrey Hepburn andGary Cooper too much to notice that they both played profoundly disturbedcharacters. In other creative hands and with a different cast, this might havemade an interesting psychological case study; after all, 1957 was the year ofThe Three Faces of Eve. This was to have been a Wilder comedy—Sabrinaon the rocks with a twist—but the film’s static compositions erased humorfrom this damp, unengaging tale. As usual, however, Audrey was silent aboutits failings and effusive in her praise of colleagues.

THE FINAL SCENE is the ultimate Hollywood cliché. Ariane sprints alongsidethe train that will forever take Flannagan away from Paris and from her.Protesting through her tears that she will be just fine, thank you, andrepeating her already exposed lies about the many men in her life, herappearance melts his stony heart, and he sweeps her up into the train and intoa final, smothering kiss.

Thoroughly exhausted after two demanding pictures in one year, Audreywas, she told Mel at Christmas, ready for a long hiatus. But they had agreedto appear in a lavish play on American television, and early in 1957, theyflew to New York for rehearsals.

# Chapter Nine

1957

AT A QUIET dinner before the Ferrers left Paris for New York in January,Hubert de Givenchy presented Audrey with a small gift box. In her honor, hehad supervised the invention of a new perfume bearing her name. “Mais,c’est interdit!” she cried: “Oh, but you can’t!”—a polite exclamation onopening a lavish present of which the recipient feels undeserving. So that thefragrance would be hers alone for a year, Givenchy said that he would refrainfrom marketing it until December. When he did, he presented it to the publicas L’Interdit, its name memorializing not only her astonished gratitude butalso the fact that it was forbidden to others for a year. The name alsowhimsically connoted a bouquet so intoxicating that it ought to be banned.

ALWAYS EAGER TO take on projects concerning his native Russia, AnatoleLitvak had, by 1957, directed the films Tovarich, The Battle of Russia andAnastasia, which had just been released and for which Ingrid Bergman wonher second Academy Award. Twenty years earlier he had also made apopular film entitled Mayerling, the name of a notorious Austrian villagelinked to a romantic tragedy. At a royal hunting lodge there, in 1889, CrownPrince Rudolf—desperate over his father’s command to put away his teenagemistress, the Baroness Marie Vetsera—shot her to death and then killedhimself. The misfortune may indeed have been a murder-suicide, but perhapsit was a political assassination, or even the result of a lunatic family vendetta:scholarship is still catching up with the facts.

In any case, Mayerling had already been the basis for no less than five

motion pictures when Litvak suggested it to the National BroadcastingCompany in New York. He also proposed that a real-life married actingcouple undertake the leading roles, and so someone at NBC contacted KurtFrings, who negotiated a lucrative deal for the Ferrers. For two weeks ofrehearsal and a week of taping in January, Audrey received $\$ 150,000$ andMel $\$ 100,000$ .

On Monday evening, February 4, the ninety-minute drama was broadcastin color, which was then a premium reserved only for exceptionalprogramming; it was later released theatrically in Europe. But the productionwas not favorably reviewed in America and soon disappeared. “A more pallidor elementary version of [the story] would be difficult to imagine,” wrote onesenior critic. “It was as if two pleasant young people were walking throughan operetta that did not have a score.” The production values and cast of morethan one hundred were impressive, the dozens of sets and multiple wardrobechanges for Audrey spectacular. But the overstuffed luxury of this Mayerling,with its grand ballroom sequences and lavish court settings, was incongruousfor an intimate tragedy—it was, in other words, all style and no substance.

As for Audrey and Mel, the critics considered their Maria and Rudolf acuriously dispassionate couple: “they never really came close to the tragiccontent of the romance that could not be.” Some reviewers and evenmembers of the crew thought there was a surprising coolness, even adistance, between the Ferrers themselves. Mel was never a convincingonscreen hero, for a certain awkwardness rendered him unconvincing; andalthough Audrey had developed a certain technique for playing a distressedyoung lover, it failed her in this case. The rehearsals were polite andperfunctory, the finished production the same.

And with that, Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer never again appearedtogether in a project. She began a year’s interval away from movie andtelevision cameras, she managed to elude the press, and she instructed HenryRogers to turn aside all requests for interviews. Meanwhile Mel completedtwo films in 1957, one of which required his presence in Mexico. There, thecouple resided at the Villa San José in Michoacán, which had famously lushgardens (the single feature that always attracted Audrey to inns or resorts),

but, to her happy surprise, no telephones.

During their holiday, she learned of the enormous success attending thepremiere of Funny Face. “Those are marvelous notices,” she wrote inresponse to a packet of reviews sent by Roger Edens.

I also saw the front page item in Variety about the breaking of box-officerecords!!!! I am deeply grateful. Hurray! Hurray! Please congratulate Kay[Thompson] for her fab[ulous] reviews (and so they should be). May it meanmany more successes for her…Thank you, and I am so very happy for you…

Although there was no telephone at the Villa, communication was possibleby telegram, and that is how Kurt Frings reached Audrey that spring. Heknew that she was concerned about her future, and she was aware that rolesfor her were becoming alarmingly repetitious: she was either the alluringnymph to a much older man (Sabrina, Funny Face, Love in the Afternoon) oran aristocrat in a period piece involving a political-romantic predicament(War and Peace, Mayerling). Since her Oscar for Roman Holiday, a certainstasis had affected both her range and her appeal. Always conscious of herimage and unwilling to play in movies that were coarse or offensive to her,Audrey had neither the age nor the quirkiness for character roles, and she wasnot at ease in movies that tested the limits of sexual frankness in the 1950s.

Hence when Kurt Frings sent her a wire about an altogether different sortof role, in a forthcoming movie based on one of the most popular andrespected novels of 1956 (still high on best-seller lists in dozens oflanguages), Audrey agreed, by return wire, to read the book. Three days later,it arrived. Profoundly affected by the story, its literary merit, honesty,courage and poignancy, Audrey finished The Nun’s Story, by KathrynHulme, in two sittings; to his credit, Mel was equally impressed and told herthat this was the role of a lifetime—if only Paramount would free her to work

for Warner Bros., which had acquired movie rights to the book.

The Nun’s Story, a novel based on one woman’s true history, concerned adevout young Belgian named Gabrielle van der Mal, daughter of a famoussurgeon, who entered a religious order in 1927. After her cloistered period oftraining, she pronounced her vows as a nun. Henceforth known as SisterLuke (named for the saint who is invoked as the patron of her father’sprofession), she was first trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked in one ofthe order’s mental asylums. Respected, dedicated and effective, she was thensent to study tropical medicine before being assigned to work with the poor inthe Belgian Congo. This she did with admirable distinction for almost nineyears before returning to the congregation’s Mother House in Belgium.During World War II, Sister Luke felt drawn to aid the Underground and theBelgian resistance, but the nuns were expected to care for both friends andenemies with equal skill and compassion: wounded Nazi soldiers had to betreated with the same care as Allies. Sister Luke found this injunctionincreasingly difficult, and so, with permission from her superiors and Vaticanauthorities, she was released from her vows and found a new vocation as alay war nurse.

Audrey found much to admire and even to identify with in The Nun’sStory. Like the heroine, she was born in Belgium; both women lost theirfathers, and both had brothers taken prisoners of war. Most of all, Audreywas captivated by Sister Luke’s fierce dedication to her conscience, and toher interior life. The novel did not present her struggle as due to a loss offaith; rather, the poignancy of that struggle sprang from the reality of faith.Sister Luke and Audrey Hepburn were deeply introspective souls,increasingly uncomfortable with mere appearance. And just as Sister Lukenever believed that the traditional religious habit defined her vocation, soAudrey Hepburn never believed that Hollywood finery—even her belovedGivenchy’s designs—defined Audrey Hepburn. The garments were simplypart of the image.

In the novel as in life, Sister Luke never lost her Catholic faith, neverbelieved that her departure from the institutional religious life meant her“divorce” from God or His abandonment of her. “Christ will not abandon me

if I go out [from the convent],” Sister Luke tells her chaplain in the novel. “Ihave given too many cups of water in His name and He knows I would go ondoing it, whether working for Him as a nun or as a war nurse.”

Audrey was never a traditional observer of any religion, but she wascertainly a woman with an elemental kind of faith in the universe: she loathedwar, she took enormous delight in the simplest realities of nature and, as herlife progressed, she experienced profound changes that resulted from deepstruggle and introspection. “I am like Sister Luke in many ways,” she said. Itwas a wise professional decision to undertake something so completelydifferent from her previous roles, and the subsequent experience of filming,as she herself wrote, forever changed her life. Any reference to The Nun’sStory, in conversations with family or strangers, always evoked Audrey’sunambiguous, enthusiastic comments.

FRINGS ALSO INFORMED Audrey that dramatist and screenwriter RobertAnderson, a member of The Playwrights Company whom she had met duringthe run of Ondine, had been commissioned to write the screenplay for TheNun’s Story. It would be helpful, Frings added in a subsequent telegram, ifAudrey would come to Hollywood for a meeting with producer Henry Blankeand with Anderson, who was there, completing an earlier assignment andgetting important background information from Kathryn Hulme, thenresiding in Los Angeles.

Hulme had met the real-life Sister Luke, a woman named Marie LouiseHabets, a year after she had left the convent. (In actuality, Marie Louise hadbeen known as Sister Marie Xavérine and had been a nun from 1927 to 1944in a Belgian community known as the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary.)In July 1945, both were working for the newly formed United Nations Reliefand Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Later, both women worked atWildflecken, a former Nazi facility that had been transformed into a refugeecamp for more than twenty thousand displaced, seriously ill patients from allover Europe.

Until that time a writer of a few respectable books with not much lastingshelf life, Hulme was on her own path to spiritual development. She had beenin Paris during the 1930s, studying with the mystical philosopher Gurdjieffand joining one of his subgroups, a small band of lesbian writers Gurdjieffcalled The Rope. Kathryn (who preferred to be addressed as Kate or Katie)was now earnestly considering how to integrate her unconventional privatelife within both her spiritual and her professional ambitions.

Marie Louise, whom friends always called Lou, gradually confided in Katethe story of her seventeen years of formal religious life. During their six yearsof work in Europe, both Kate and Lou continued their own inner journeys of“conversion” to find their own true selves and thus, as they put it, to turnwholly toward God. They also found that they were indeed soul mates. In1952, they came together to America. Kate resumed her career as a writer,while Lou worked as a nurse.

Quite on her own and with no pressure from her companion, Katesubsequently converted to Catholicism, which sealed her association withLou on every important level. It was not long thereafter that Lou suggestedher own story to Kate as subject for a book—“because it might do somegood,” as Lou said. “These were the words of a nun,” Kate wrote later inanother book dedicated to Lou, “words of faith and hope, illumined with thesweet charity of wishing to share her hard-earned treasure of impregnablebelief with all those who—in the words of Gurdjieff—were ‘hungry forsomething else.’”

The result of the former nun’s suggestion was indeed “something else.”When The Nun’s Story appeared in 1956, it quickly sold over three millioncopies in English and many more millions in foreign languages. Kate Hulmeand Lou Habets remained important players in the life of Audrey Hepburn,who was deeply impressed by both women and maintained a long andaffectionate connection to both.*10  In early June 1957, Audrey agreed to go toLos Angeles to meet with them and with Robert Anderson to discuss TheNun’s Story.

ROBERT WOODRUFF ANDERSON, who had just turned forty that April and wastherefore exactly Mel’s age, was—also like Mel—tall, gallant and courteous.Born in New York, he took his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Harvard andcompleted all requirements for his doctorate in literature before he joined thenavy during World War II (in which he was awarded the Bronze Star).Before that, in 1940, at the age of twenty-three, he married the theatricalproducer and dramaturge Phyllis Stohl, who was ten years his senior.

After the war, Anderson’s writing career flourished under the lovingtutelage of his wife: his plays, mostly lyrical narratives about adults inromantic dilemmas, were produced off-Broadway and in regional theaters—until 1953, when Tea and Sympathy began a two-year New York run beforeits long and equally successful tour and many foreign productions. Dedicatedto his work and known for his uncompromising professionalism, he was, in1957, much in demand as playwright and screenwriter. But his marriage hada heartbreaking finale. Just when Tea and Sympathy opened, Phyllis wasdiagnosed with cancer, and for three years Anderson nursed her during heragonizing decline before her death.

Her loss left Anderson a shattered man, haunted by her memory and evenobsessed with their marriage for the rest of his life: he spoke of Phyllis daily,to friends and acquaintances, to students during his many lectureships and tothe press in interviews. This habit, often sometimes indiscreet, continuedeven after his second marriage, in 1959, to the actress Teresa Wright; herprize-winning career on stage, screen and television spanned from 1938,when she was twenty, to her death at eighty-six, in 2005.

Phyllis had died on November 28, 1956, and within days, Bob was veryclose to complete nervous collapse. At that time, Ingrid Bergman waspreparing to appear in the Paris production of Tea and Sympathy. Bob’s agentwas that legendary wise woman Kay Brown, who had been responsible(among other memorable achievements) for convincing David O. Selznick toimport to Hollywood Alfred Hitchcock from England and Ingrid Bergmanfrom Sweden. Among the most prestigious names in American stage and

screen history, Kay Brown now represented both Anderson and Bergman.

Weeks after Phyllis’s death, Kay contacted Ingrid in Paris, wherepreparations for the French premiere of Tea and Sympathy had been brieflypostponed when the actress required an emergency appendectomy. After Kaytold her about Bob’s depression, Ingrid at once picked up the telephone andrang him. “I think you belong over here,” she said. “It’s Christmas, and youshouldn’t be alone. The play will give you a purpose and a family.” Shebooked a room for him at the Hôtel Raphaël, where she was lodging (as hadAudrey and Mel), and when Bob arrived in Paris on December 10, Ingrid wasat the airport to meet him.

She had recently been through a different kind of distressing experience:her troubled marriage to director Roberto Rossellini had finally reachedcritical mass when he flaunted his affair with an Indian actress he intended tomarry, even bigamously if necessary. Ingrid had left him and relocated toParis, where she was now free to accept offers to appear on stage and screen—invitations Rossellini had hitherto discouraged or flatly forbidden.However debated their artistic merits, Rossellini’s films had left himbankrupt, and they had three children to support. This responsibility Ingridassumed at once: she accepted Jean Renoir’s offer to star in Eléna et leshommes (with Mel), and Twentieth Century–Fox invited her to assume thetitle role in Anatole Litvak’s Anastasia; her French dramatic debut in Teaand Sympathy was to follow. At forty-two, Ingrid Bergman was beginning atriumphant second act to her distinguished career.

As Ingrid and Bob discussed the play and shared their recent heartaches, itis perhaps not surprising that these two sympathetic people became ardentlovers. “One Paris critic reviewed Ingrid favorably,” Anderson recalled, “buthe didn’t much like Tea and Sympathy, and so he wrote, ‘Ingrid Bergmansaves the play.’ Later, I wrote her a note: ‘Ingrid Bergman saved the play—and the playwright, too.’”

Bob was, as he said, madly in love with her—but Ingrid was morepragmatic and knew that the relationship had a term. “I realized very quicklythat he was a man who couldn’t cope any longer with anything,” she recalled,

“and I did all I could to help him survive. He was very close to me in thosedays. Maybe I was in need, too. I knew [our relationship] was importantperhaps to both of us.” She also knew that his base was in the Americantheater and that he was now accepting important Hollywood offers—professional developments that would help his emotional recovery.

More to the point, she saw that their affair had sprung mostly from hisdesperate neediness. “I want you to get hold of yourself alone,” she wrote toBob on January 26, 1957. “I can’t help you. Right now, you must fight it outalone. To be in Paris again [with me] would just be to hide away with oneperson. But you know it would only be worse afterwards. There wouldalways come the time when you have to face the loneliness.”

Ingrid was, after all, still Mrs. Rossellini, and some time would intervenebefore she was free to marry again; in addition, her professional life, likeBob’s, would require long and distant separations between them—she inEurope, he in Hollywood. But to the credit of both, when their romanceended, they transformed it into a warm lifelong friendship.

While in Paris, Bob at last sat down with The Nun’s Story, which Phyllishad read not long before her death, telling him that he ought to write thescreenplay. At the same time, Kay Brown was eager to find as much work asshe could for Ingrid, too—and so she suggested that Ingrid play the leadingrole in the film. At Christmastime in Paris, Ingrid and Bob read the booktogether. He liked it enormously and saw marvelous dramatic and movingpossibilities, but Ingrid recognized at once that she was too old to play SisterLuke.

Instead, Ingrid proposed Audrey Hepburn. Bob relayed the idea to Kay,and Kay contacted Kurt Frings, who then sent a telegram to Audrey. ByJanuary, Kay had made the deal for Bob, and Frings was negotiating withWarner, who was delighted that Paramount, which had just sufferedconsiderable losses with War and Peace, had turned down The Nun’s Story.The picture, Paramount reasoned, would require the considerable expense offilming in Europe and Africa, and so they agreed to loan out Audrey toWarner in exchange for adding a picture to her contract.

For the moment, things were happening quickly.

In the spring of 1957, Bob Anderson had just completed the script for theRobert Wise film Until They Sail and was commuting between his home inNew York and visits to Hollywood for research and meetings on The Nun’sStory. At the same time, Warner signed Fred Zinnemann to direct.Zinnemann had begun his career in Europe, and after coming to America, hehad directed a number of important films—among them, The Men (MarlonBrando’s first film), High Noon and From Here to Eternity; he had alreadywon two Academy Awards and would earn two more in his long,distinguished career. Zinnemann was a meticulous craftsman who didprotracted, detailed research; he was also known for his quiet courtesy withactors; he had a highly refined European sensibility; and he insisted on thefinest production values.

By late April, Jack Warner, Henry Blanke, Fred Zinnemann and RobertAnderson were awaiting word on Audrey’s participation. Finally, thepotential problem with Paramount was settled, but another occurred: Audreyhad promised Mel that she would star in a film of the exotic romance GreenMansions, which he wanted to direct in fulfillment of Audrey’s obligation toMGM. First Mel had to complete his acting assignments and then travel toMexico and South America for research for Green Mansions even beforefixing a start date. As it happened, Audrey was able to complete The Nun’sStory before beginning Green Mansions.

IN EARLY JUNE, Audrey arrived in Los Angeles to meet the creative team sofar assembled. Robert Anderson, who had just returned from a research tripto convents in Belgium, met her at the airport, as Ingrid had once greeted him—and with the same result. Bob’s affair with Ingrid had ended as gently assuch things can. Now, that summer in Los Angeles, Audrey Hepburn andRobert Anderson began a long, intense romance.

Over the course of several years, Bob confided the details of the affair tothis author, asking that it not be set down until after Audrey’s death. “Mynovel After [published in 1973] really tells the whole story of my affair with

Audrey,” he said. Indeed, the book is a lightly coded document of the entirerange of their intimacy, often in astonishingly frank sexual detail.

After tells the story of a writer named Chris Larsen, in his early forties(Bob was forty in 1957); in the opening chapters of the book, he nurses hiscancer-stricken wife until her death—just as Bob had done for Phyllis. Christhen meets a twenty-two-year-old actress named Marianne: Audrey wastwenty-eight and had just played the role of Ariane. The novelist’sdescription of Marianne is a perfect description of Audrey: “The first thingyou noticed was ‘style.’ She was tall and slender and held herself beautifully,almost like a dancer. Her dark hair was worn in her own particular style, notthe style of the day…I saw her large dark eyes…The entire effect of her wasstriking. She had style, dedication, real excitement.”

In After, Marianne dresses as did Audrey that summer in California and asshe preferred to dress, in private, all her life: “She had changed into bluejeans and a faded scarlet turtleneck sweater.” Bob’s reaction to Audrey thatsummer was also memorialized in Chris’s words: “I didn’t think aboutanything except that there was this extraordinary girl out there who haddropped into my life. She was life, not death, and for some reason I could notunderstand, I functioned [sexually] beautifully with her.”

Bob and Audrey met privately at the home of one of her friends who wasaway for the summer. “She was a very tidy girl,” he wrote ofMarianne/Audrey in the novel, “insisting on cleaning up after breakfast andwanting to go beyond that and clean the whole kitchen.” Most of all,however, he recalled that “she was sad—beautiful and sad and romantic.”The description could have been offered by Audrey’s son, who later wrote of“the inner sadness she had always carried inside her.”

In the novel, the subject turns to Marianne’s past: in passage after passageof the novel, Bob wrote of Audrey speaking of herself:

There’s not a great deal that I want to talk about. My ideas on marriagewere formed very early…I never saw my father. Oh, I’ve seen picturesof him, all I could get my hands on. Very handsome. Good family,

whatever that is…My mother tells me that there was a marriage and aquick divorce, and some money changed hands. She never marriedagain. She has a very low opinion of men…[Father] turned into a bit of ahermit, I understand. Strangely, I don’t feel much bitterness towardshim. My mother used to go on and on about how horrible he was, butsince I couldn’t understand her, I instinctively got very defensive abouthim. His image has been very important to me. I fantasize that he’ssomewhere in Europe, living alone, writing day and night on a greatbody of important work, and one day—one day he’ll show up at a stagedoor where I’m playing.

As Audrey and Bob devoted time each day to discussing Sister Luke, so hememorialized her professional devotion in his novel. “What I want in thisworld,” says Marianne,

is to devote my life to some one or some thing. Complete, whole.Dedication. When I was a girl, I thought of becoming a nun. Theirconcentration and dedication excited me. I get the same feeling aboutsome dancers, musicians, artists. To give up everything to do one thingwell, and not make anyone else pay for that dedication.

And the reaction of Chris/Bob was immediate: “I adored her. I was in awe ofher talent and her dedication to her talent.”

Since her childhood, Audrey had always loved bicycles, and that was herpreferred mode of getting about at movie studios, on location and along thestreets of Beverly Hills that summer. The bicycle became a recurring prop inAfter, the means by which Marianne arrives and departs at Chris’s summerhouse. Like Audrey’s that summer, Marianne’s was “a red bike with abasket.” In tribute to that summer, Bob created several scenes for Sister Lukeand her bicycle in The Nun’s Story. Years later, he recalled these pleasantmemories and their poignant conclusion.

Robert Anderson spoke privately and wrote in fiction with disarmingfrankness about his affair with Audrey Hepburn—an affair encoded in hisnovel.

“We mustn’t be apart again,” says Chris after one long, intimate afternoon.

“She drew back and looked at me with a questioning frown, then nestledher head against my shoulder. She was loving and passionate but, I thought, alittle reserved.”

As Anderson said years later, “That was Audrey.”

That summer of 1957, Audrey recognized (as had Ingrid) that Bob’s greatpassion for her, and his extravagant expression of commitment—despite hermarriage—was based on a terrible loneliness. According to him, she spoke inprecisely the terms Marianne uses when Chris professes his adoration of herin a love letter:

You don’t know me…You may think you feel [this adoration] becauseof the situation, but I don’t think it has anything to do with me. I mean,to adore, to want to put one’s life in someone’s hands…Your situation isso unusual. You’re so susceptible. Your feelings are lovely, but I don’tthink the letter was addressed to me but to some terrible need in you tofill the void, the emptiness. To belong to someone again.

In many ways, After is as much a courageous admission of the author’spsychological state after his wife’s death, and his obsession with her, as it isan acknowledgment that his affair with Audrey was (like that with Ingrid)doomed. But during that summer, the end of the real-life romance was yet tocome.

IN EARLY JULY, Audrey returned to meet Mel for a brief holiday in Europe;finally, she signed her contract with the jubilant Jack Warner in late summershe was to receive $\$ 250,000$ plus ten percent of the film’s gross receipts,which eventually earned her almost $\$ 4$ million over four years. Bob traveledwith her as far as New York, where they stayed for a few days at hisapartment on East 79th Street. She then went to join Mel, while Andersoncompleted the first draft of The Nun’s Story and prepared to go to Africa for

research with Zinnemann and art director Alexandre Trauner.

Aware that there would of course be changes and revisions, Bob alsocontinued his constant correspondence with Kate and Lou, plying them fordetails about how a young woman in Belgium, circa 1927, took leave of herfamily on the day she entered a convent; how nuns donned their veils; howthe ceremony of haircutting was accomplished; how they managed the layersof antique garb in their habits; how rules and regulations determined thecourse of everyday life; and asking for some reflections on the rhythms ofprayer, work, recreation and silence in the lives of nuns dedicated to nursing.

“Trying to shape your excellent book for the screen is a tremendouschallenge,” Bob wrote to Kate. “Actually, your story line is so excellent andso dramatic in itself, that the major work I’ll have to do is putting words inmouths where you have simply narrated scenes. You have written it withsuch a sense of drama, that you have given us the majority of the scenes—itwill only be for us to make them work in terms of action and dialogue.”Anderson shaped the screenplay with complete fidelity to the book, andalmost all the dialogue in the film may be found on the pages of the novel.His great achievement, however, was the judicious excision of scenes fromthe book for cinematic economy.

With The Nun’s Story, Audrey wished to be involved in every aspect of thefilm’s creation, and so in late September, she met Zinnemann and Andersonin Rome for research. They had just returned from Stanleyville, in theBelgian Congo, where they scouted for the proper locations and found localdoctors who provided them with operating room equipment dating from1930. Zinnemann was a perfectionist in every detail, and under the propertutelage, Audrey learned precisely how surgical instruments were used andhandled, just as she was learning every detail of convent life. There was alsoa unique challenge for cosmetician Alberto De Rossi, who had to devisemakeup for Audrey and the dozens of actresses who were playing nuns: theintense interior lighting for Technicolor film required them to wear makeup—but they had, of course, to look as if they were wearing none at all.*11Audrey also attended meetings with Trauner, then supervising the design andconstruction of dozens of interior sets at Cinecittà Studios.

Returning to California, she rented the home of Deborah Kerr (who wasthen working on a film in England), at 685 Elkins Road, in the Brentwoodsection of Los Angeles, high in the hills above Sunset Boulevard. From there,she made frequent visits to Kate and Lou, asking them questions and learningabout wardrobe, rituals and gestures—how to walk, kneel and bow, and whatwere the proper aspects of convent deportment. But the camaraderie betweenher and the two older women did not come easily.

“She didn’t really want to meet me at first,” according to Lou. “She felt thestory was too much of my private life. She just sat there and looked at me anddidn’t ask any questions.” She and Kate put Audrey at ease, asking questionsabout her own life and career and talking about Belgium. Soon, Audreyrelaxed, and the three women shared a warmth and familiarity their friendsreferred to as the 3-H Club.

Also in Los Angeles, Audrey read the second draft of the screenplay,which contained Zinnemann’s emendations. Her response to him indicatesthe depth of her understanding of the role and her extraordinary sensibilityabout making this character credible, sympathetic and yet faithful to the truestory.

“I think we have a slight difference in the conception of Sister Luke,”Audrey wrote to Zinnemann on November 19.

I am bothered by the fact that Sister Luke calls herself a “failure” at the endof our story. She is too intelligent to display what sounds to me like falsehumility. I still wish she could somehow express herself as having failed as anun but that her hopes and faith have been reborn at the thought of beingable to function as a free human being and consequently with more devotionthan before. I still would like to feel the start of something new and strong atthe end of the story, instead of a sense of dejection and defeat on her part anda kind of artificial whitewashing of the Order. Like you, I want the finalsituation to be fifty-fifty, so that neither the nun nor the Order becomes avillain.

Audrey was on the mark, and appropriate changes were made. In thefinished film as in the book, it is quite clear than the departure of Sister Luke—who had always expected too much of herself—was not at all a matter offailure, much less of sin. When the film was released, however, virtuallyevery reviewer and most audiences discussed the wonderful Hepburn filmabout a nun who failed in her vocation.

But it is not at all about failure: it is about transformation.

“You’ve got to learn to bend a little, or you’ll break,” says MotherChristophe (played by Beatrice Straight), her sympathetic superior in nursingduties at the mental asylum. Sister Luke’s first vocation, she was told, was tothe institutional religious life. After seventeen years of selfless work there,she was a woman of whom the superior general, Mother Emmanuel, said,“Your sisters love you, the doctors trust you, and your students respect youenormously.” And when she felt drawn to help the resistance during the war,her second vocation took her out of the convent but not away from lifelongcommitment to selfless work: “I have given too many cups of water in Hisname and He knows I would go on doing it, whether working for Him as anun or as a war nurse.”

As the year ended, Audrey prepared for the filming of the most challengingrole of her career—the most difficult, the most physically painful and themost exhausting. What Kate and Lou called Audrey’s own “dear soul” wasabout to flourish and deepen, certainly beyond even her own expectations.

# Chapter Ten

# January–June 1958

“WE GOT TOGETHER and talked about the character of Sister Luke,” FredZinnemann recalled, speaking of January 1958. He, Audrey and BobAnderson were in Rome for the first two weeks of that month, visitingconvents and psychiatric hospitals and conferring with clergymen engagedboth as expert advisers and as insurance against the possibility that someCatholics—those who knew very little about the formal religious life ofmonks and nuns—might be offended by the account of a nun released fromvows. “We talked about how Sister Luke develops, and how she reacts toother characters. It took many hours of going into lots of details. We alsospoke about what Sister Luke was thinking…so she gradually started to livewith that, and she found the role in concrete form in the convents, when shesaw the nuns.”

Regarding the assistance and approval of Catholic clergy and nuns,Warner, Blanke and Zinnemann not only wanted to represent accurately thedetails of Catholic rituals and of convent life: they also wanted to avoid anycensure or disapproval of the film for the way it treated its controversialsubject matter—especially since no one in any major capacity on The Nun’sStory was Catholic.

Zinnemann and Anderson were especially gratified that month when anumber of highly respected priests—like Rev. Harold C. Gardiner, the Jesuitscholar and literary editor of the weekly magazine America—read thescreenplay. Not only did he and his colleagues have no objections, theypraised it as a deeply spiritual scenario that would make for an importantfilm. In addition, the Cinema Office in Rome, which handles requests put to

the Vatican for assistance or tacit approval, assigned a group of Dominicanpriests to work with the production company. Anticipating sensationalismand not known for leniency, especially in matters of clerical image, theDominicans were surprised to find that only one or two matters of detailwarranted their comment. “Eventually,” Zinnemann added, “caution gaveway to trust and finally to most generous help [from the Dominicans],without which the film could not have been made.”

Meanwhile, the director engaged a magnificent cast of internationallyesteemed actors: Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Dame Edith Evans, Peter Finch,Mildred Dunnock, Beatrice Straight, Patricia Collinge, Ruth White, MargaretPhillips, Niall MacGinnis, Lionel Jeffries, Barbara O’Neil, Colleen Dewhurstand Stephen Murray. The production archives disclose that all these playersquickly agreed to participate, for two reasons: the opportunity to assume rolesthat were vividly written, and the prospect of working with Audrey. PeggyAshcroft’s recollection was to the point. “I rarely accepted film roles at thattime,” she said years later, “but this was not to be turned down. I admiredAudrey Hepburn enormously, and I found the screenplay irresistible.”

Zinnemann was also fortunate in assembling appropriate nonspeaking bitplayers for the scenes of the entire community of nuns: he personallyinterviewed more than seven hundred women and then selected 109 ladieswho walked with unselfconscious dignity and who comported themselveswith natural but formal decorum. “Twenty dancers were also borrowed fromthe ballet corps of the Rome Opera and were drilled by two Dominican nuns,one of them a university professor. For the nuns’ close-ups, faces of greatcharacter and personality were needed. We found them mostly among theRoman aristocracy: a lot of principessas and contessas turned up in theirRolls-Royces or Mercedes at five in the morning. Dressed as nuns, theylooked marvelous.” The local sisters who trained these laywomen were sopleased with the results that, on returning to their convents, they becameimpatient with the young nuns. “You should do better than that,” they told thejuniors. “Mr. Zinnemann’s nuns are perfect!”

Patricia Bosworth was a young New York stage actress who had beenrecommended by Anderson for the role of Sister Marie Christine, a novice

who departs on the eve of Vow Day. She joined Audrey and others in the castfor a unique kind of preparation: “Fred Zinnemann arranged for us to visitconvents in Rome, and to observe procedures at the Salvator Mundi Hospital,where we learned how nursing nuns were trained.” Bosworth also recalledthe ubiquitous presence of a priest adviser on the set all during principalphotography, instructing the “nuns” how to walk, move and bow.

After two weeks in Rome, the women proceeded to Paris, whereextraordinary and unprecedented arrangements had been made for Audreyand others to have long discussions with nuns and even to live for severaldays in convents. “One of the French religious orders,” Zinnemann recalled,

gave us permission to have each of our key actresses stay in a differentconvent for several days, going through the entire ritual of the day,starting with the first prayers at 5.30 a.m. until the Grand Silence at theend of the day. I stashed my “nuns” away at different convents, each oneseparately…Making the daily rounds to see how they were doing, I’darrive in the warmth of a taxi (it was mid-January in Paris, the winterwas intensely cold and the convents were hardly heated), and all of themwould come out of the cloisters absolutely purple with cold butfascinated by what they were involved in and very excited by the waythey were getting prepared for their characters.

This entire time of preparation was, Zinnemann added, “an interior voyage ofdiscovery and an enormous personal experience” for everyone working onThe Nun’s Story.

After the cast and crew had been immunized against tropical diseases, theyproceeded to the Belgian Congo, where filming began on January 28, 1958,and continued until February 23. During those weeks, scenes were shot at theold railway station in Stanleyville, at a native market, in a hospital, at amission school, in several villages and at an island leper colony. All thenonspeaking Africans in the film were locals, many of them often confusedwith all the paraphernalia of moviemaking but nonetheless eager to cooperatewith their strange visitors. The heat and humidity were oppressive, and giantbugs and dangerous snakes were ever present during filming.

“It was very hard, unglamorous work,” Audrey said later, recalling the“sometimes almost dangerous exhaustion. But it was my best memory of anyfilm set, because of our close community spirit in the Congo.” Another kindof danger occurred during the filming in Rome, on March 23, when Audreycollapsed at Cinecittà in excruciating pain. Her condition was diagnosed as acritical attack of kidney stones, and she was given morphine to relieve thepain. For an entire day, there was considerable alarm that she might have tosubmit to serious and risky surgery, but the kidney stones eventually passed.The production was shut down for several days, but Audrey made a quickreturn to work.

In a long letter to Kate and Lou, Fred’s Zinnemann’s wife, Renée (presentduring the entire production), detailed the circumstances of working in theCongo that February. Several scenes involved surgery in a native hospital:“The girls [Audrey and others] and Fred have watched some pretty gruesomeoperations—a cancerous tumor and a Caesarian section (the baby died). Itwas quite a traumatic experience for all, as none had been around operatingrooms before except Fred.”

Forever after, Fred Zinnemann cherished the memory of his leading lady.

After more than twenty-five years, I am struck by the fine, firm line ofdevelopment in Audrey’s performance. The subconscious quality ofindependence is present in all her actions. When she comes running inlate [for a scene in which the postulants are going to chapel], her hastebetrays the inner calm she should be developing. Or when the girlsprostrate themselves on the floor in front of the Mother General, Audreypeeks out of one eye, curiosity getting the better of her.

Audrey’s performance was in fact composed of countless such moments thatseemed to erase the distance between actress and character.

FROM HOLLYWOOD TO New York, then on to Rome, Paris, Brussels and theCongo, Bob Anderson had pursued the affair with Audrey, and she hadresponded passionately. Bob was, after all, a man she admired: cultivated andhandsome, he was a serious and respected playwright, screenwriter and

essayist; he had given her the finest script of her career; and he was attentiveand courtly, but not annoyingly deferential, in his obvious adoration of her.

But then there was an ironic and poignant repetition of the past.

One evening in May, Audrey spoke to Bob of her intense longing to be amother. Mel did not enter the conversation, but it was clear to Bob that hermarriage was deeply and perhaps irreparably troubled. He took this as animplication that—were she to leave Mel for him—she wanted and expectedto have children. With great sadness, Bob told Audrey that he could never bea father: he was congenitally sterile. It is unlikely that she did not, at thatmoment, think of William Holden.

That was the heartbreaking conclusion to the affair that might have becomea marriage. There was no long, difficult conversation—no explanations orrecriminations. “We kissed good-bye and I exiled myself in London andwrote a play,” Anderson said years later. Unlike Ingrid, Audrey made a cleanbreak with Bob, and they met only once more; she seems to have been sodeeply hurt by this revelation that she could not sustain even his friendship.She simply wanted to end this chapter of her life and perhaps even to forgetit. “If you hear from Audrey,” Bob wrote in a sad letter to Kate and Lou,“give her my best. I’m anxious to hear from her. She was magnificent—agreat actress and a great sport. She went through hell.”

APART FROM ITS sustained reflection on the primacy of conscience, The Nun’sStory is a tender elegy for a kind of religious life that once was the normamong certain groups of nuns, but is now rarely found in the Roman CatholicChurch. The practice of humiliations, the suppression of personality, theattempt to put aside normal human feelings and the unnatural efforts even toignore one’s own past: these were, from about the seventeenth century inEurope and later in America, taken for granted as guaranteed paths toholiness in some religious orders of monks and nuns. To good effect, almostevery community later abandoned those practices, under encouragement fromthe Vatican itself. The Nun’s Story and Audrey’s recognizably human Sister

Luke offered neither a gratuitous endorsement nor a smug disapproval of thisrarefied life of long ago.

When the picture was released, one of the director’s advisers—a nunnamed Mother Marie-Edmond—wrote to Zinnemann from her Paris conventafter seeing the film with her community. Her critical comments represent thecommon judgment of European and American religious women in 1959:

The discipline of postulants seems exaggerated—at times, it looks likeliving in barracks! And everything seems directed toward personalperfection [rather than] the love of God. Audrey Hepburn realizes herdifficult part admirably and with perfect tact. There is nothing ridiculousabout her or any other actress, whereas most pictures portraying nuns donot avoid that danger…But Sister Luke and the other nuns give theimpression of living under constraint: they quench everything which issimply human and they seem just to live through formalities androutines (except in the Congo). They have hardly any friendly relations.This is sometimes a little true of the religious life, which necessarilyimposes certain constraints on the novices, but this is totally false as tothe whole of the life.

Audrey’s achievement was indeed “realized admirably”—in fact, it wasnothing short of inspired. She had neither a sophisticated wardrobe byGivenchy nor even an Edith Head suit to command viewers’ attention—indeed, only her remarkable face and her expressive, delicate hands werevisible. Instead of high key lighting to glamorize her, there were only thelineaments of her own inner life: she created a compelling portrait of spiritualanguish and maturing integrity, and this she accomplished only with her eyesand the subtlest gradations of expression; almost everything was internal.

This was a performance vastly superior to any other before or after in hercareer; in fact, it is defensible that Audrey Hepburn’s Sister Luke is one ofthe greatest performances in the history of film. Not only is the character farmore profound that anyone she ever portrayed: she also locatedcorrespondences within herself that revealed, possibly far beyond herrealization, some of the depths of Audrey Hepburn, and what she took with

utmost gravity in her life.

Almost always, while watching movies, viewers make adjustments ofperception, trying to close the gap between actor and role; but for the mostpart, we watch actors pretending to be someone, and however unconsciously,we cannot entirely suspend our understanding that the performer is not thecharacter. We see someone “playing” (the word is significant), affectingsomeone else’s identity, and we admire, or we do not, the technique, thetricks of the trade, the fake tears, the lighting, the judicious editing, thesupporting music—all the components movies employ to help us accept asauthentic what we see. Our assessments of performances, therefore, areusually simple: we say that an actor was effective as so-and-so—in otherwords, we admire the pretense, the “playing.” Apart from documentaries, wevery rarely accept that the person on screen and the character portrayed areone: that occurs only when we observe very gifted artists.

In the case of Audrey Hepburn in this role, however, something very rareoccurred. We are not, in the final analysis, watching her pretend. To thecontrary, we proceed with her reality every step of the arduous, honorablejourney, as Gabrielle van der Mal becomes Sister Luke and embarks on atransforming spiritual adventure with a deeper knowledge of herself andtherefore, as the film affirms, of what might be called God’s active andongoing guidance of her life and destiny. The division between actress androle has indeed been entirely erased.

“The idea of the cloister is a repellent one to those who believe that earthlylife is the purpose and value of earthly existence,” wrote the critic StanleyKauffmann when the picture was released. “But the film’s strength, sustainedby Miss Hepburn’s performance, is such that even the unconvinced will feel atug of envy for those who have found the assurances which he can neveraccept. And that, after all, is the point of Sister Luke’s story.”

The exterior similarities between Audrey and Sister Luke, which shelearned from the book, from the screenplay and from her friendship with Lou,doubtless gave her powerful starting points for discovering that a veryimportant part of herself was indeed like this nun. Both Audrey and Sister

Luke were born in Belgium; both left home at a young age to pursue a career.Both were transplanted to alien countries, where they flourished whileworking constantly. Both were caught in the violence of the war in Holland;both had brothers captured by the Germans—and both lost their fathers.Hence there was, right from the start, a symbiosis of accidents that, in verydeep ways, joined character and actress. “My mother had always impressedon us that one has to be useful,” Audrey said years later, “and that giving lovewas more important than receiving it. As Sister Luke, it was enormouslyhelpful for me to remember that. And I found that something happened whenI put on the habit of a nun. Once you do that, you feel something.”

“Audrey has reached a new maturity,” wrote Zinnemann to Kurt Fringstoward the end of production. “I have never seen anyone more disciplined,more gracious or more dedicated to her work than Audrey. There was no ego,no asking for extra favors; there was the greatest consideration for her co-workers…She has proven herself a great actress in a very difficult andexacting part.” He and several others in the cast (Peggy Ashcroft amongthem) exchanged letters over the ensuing years in which they praisedAudrey’s almost uncanny comprehension of each scene.

Those involved in the production noticed that Audrey became quieter,keeping more and more to herself as the weeks passed after Bob Anderson’sdeparture. She trusted her makeup crew and never used a mirror; nor wouldshe listen to the radio or phonograph records, “because Sister Luke wouldnever do these things,” she said. Audrey was not playing at being a nun: partof her true self was paradoxically a nonreligious nun. Several lines from thefilm punctuated her own conversations for the rest of her life, among themthis part of the exchange between Sister Luke and Mother Christophe,superior of the mental asylum:

STER LUKE: I thought that one would reach some sort of resting place whereobedience would be natural and struggle would end.

OTHER CHRISTOPHE: There is no final resting place, ever. But you must have

patience with yourself.

She would, making these words her own, speak not of obedience but rather ofcourage; of her lifelong attempt to rid herself of paralyzing fear and radicalinsecurity.

Audrey needed both qualities that January, for she had to cope withdebilitating exhaustion during the Congo filming. “Audrey is in almost everyshot,” Zinnemann wrote to Warner executive Steve Trilling. “I tried to forcethe pace and to extend the working hours once or twice, but I found that evenAudrey, with her fantastic stamina and her discipline, cannot go beyondseven p.m. without looking and feeling very badly the next day. In all myyears in this business, I have never seen such dedication.”

Although she was nominally, generically Protestant, Audrey proclaimed nodenominational allegiance; in any case, she was more than receptive to thosetranscendent realities toward which authentic Christian belief reaches—andwhich were at the heart of Hulme’s novel. That Audrey possessed a sense ofawe before the simple things in nature was acknowledged by all who knewher. That she sympathized with suffering; that she saw herself as no betterthan any ordinary woman; that she was never haughty with her colleaguesand the public but always considerate and serene despite her own anxieties;that she took pleasure in material things and in her own sexuality, and yet didnot depend on them for ultimate happiness—these were qualities recognizedby her intimates and colleagues. And she was most certainly, that year,“hungry for something more,” which is the clearest sign of that much abusedand devalued word spirituality. “The part [of Sister Luke] was suited to mynature,” she told the press.

Audrey Hepburn and Fred Zinnemann were deeply moved by the faith ofthe nuns they met in Paris and in Africa—“the marvelous serenity,” as hesaid, with which they went about their duties and devotion. Some of thosewho provided medical care for the poorest, he recalled, “themselves livedunder the most primitive conditions in the steaming forest.” He also

remembered a clinic for lepers, run by an elderly Dutch nun who had beenworking with the outcasts for thirty-five years: “She exemplified all the joy oflife, even though she spent her days among people who were dying. I asked ifshe had ever been back to Europe. She looked at me in amazement: ‘Whyshould I go back? I have never been sick!’ That was the only possible reasonthat occurred to her. Such serenity, fastness of purpose and devotion wereawesome qualities for an outsider to witness, especially for a movie director.”

Audrey was equally moved. “After looking inside an insane asylum,visiting a leper colony, talking to missionary workers and watchingoperations, I developed a new kind of inner peacefulness.”

Indeed, she was being changed by this role, and she knew it. On April 7,Audrey wrote to Kate and Lou from Rome, where the interiors of the moviewere being filmed.

…All I can tell you is that any resemblance between the present Hepburn andthe former one dating back to January 1st of 1958 [before filming began] ispurely accidental. I have seen, heard, learnt so much and have been soenriched by a milliard experiences that I am and feel a different person….

Delving into the heart and mind of Sister Luke, I have also had to dig deepdown in myself. Thereby having done a bit of ploughing of the soul—so tospeak—the seeds of all I have experienced have fallen on neatly preparedground, and I hope will result in harvesting a better Audrey…Hope thisdoesn’t sound too flowery, but my vocabulary is, I’m afraid, too poor toaccurately describe the constant joys and gratitude of your happy postulant…

Lots of LOVE,

Audrey

And in an Easter telegram to the same friends, Audrey wrote: “Joyous happyEaster from your ever loving Sister Audrey.”

HER PERFORMANCE, one critic hoped, would “forever silence those who havethought her less an actress than a symbol of the sophisticated child-woman.In The Nun’s Story, Miss Hepburn reveals the kind of acting talent that canproject inner feelings of both depth and complexity so skillfully you mustscrutinize her intently on a second and third viewing to perceive how shedoes it.” And the critic for Variety—a trade publication not known for seeingmuch beyond commercial possibilities—acclaimed “a soaring and luminousfilm [in which] Audrey Hepburn has her most demanding film role and givesher finest performance.”*12

From first to last scenes, The Nun’s Story deals with its profound subjectmatter as few films have ever done. Mediocre talents—those of the writer,director and cast—might well have sentimentalized Sister Luke, or beencontemptuous of her, or melodramatized her. But the picture remains a modelof fidelity to Kathryn Hulme’s meditative literary novel and to the true storyof the remarkable woman on whom that novel is based.

The movie also sustains its own careful structure. It opens, for example, asGabrielle van der Mal prepares to leave home to enter the convent: in close-up, she is seen removing a friendship ring, or perhaps an engagement band,from her finger; she then places the ring beside a small framed photo of ayoung man named Jean (the French form of Ian, Audrey’s half-brother,whose picture it is). She snaps shut her valise and puts on a cloche hat. At thelast moment of the film, we see her remove her nun’s ring, place a plain hatin her valise and close it.

The picture has many such small but significant moments that rewardcareful attention. When Gabrielle descends the staircase at home to depart forthe convent, she sees her father in the parlor. He stands distractedly at apiano, playing with one finger the first notes of “Voi che sapete”—Cherubino’s aria from Mozart’s opera Le nozze di Figaro. Then she steps

toward him and, standing at his side, she continues the melody. In variousorchestrations, this music recurs at key moments in Franz Waxman’spowerful, evocative score for the film. The text of the aria perfectly italicizesthe core of the opera and this movie, for just as Cherubino sings to theCountess and Susanna, so Gabrielle may ask of the nuns: “You ladies whoknow what love is, see if that is what I have in my heart.”

And at the last moment of the film, there occurs something that is verynearly breathtaking in its aptness and poignancy. As Gabrielle walks slowlyfrom the convent into the world, Audrey gave the film its final, mostmemorable and poignant moment. We remain with the camera in the room asshe walks away from us. But she cannot overcome seventeen years ofcustom: about to descend the step from the convent to the street, she reachesback to gather the long nun’s skirts she once had—and she hesitates briefly,the subtlest sign of her realization that now she is wearing a laywoman’smuch shorter dress and coat. At last she continues on her way. Shown from adistance, from behind the actress and in silence, this moment is all the moreeffective because of that distance. Then we hear the deep tolling of a bell, andthe film ends as it began.

Robert Wolders, who was very close to Audrey in the last years of her life,found the picture difficult to watch after her death. “I think the film thatreflects Audrey the most is The Nun’s Story. For all her sense of fun, she wasextremely introspective, as is Sister Luke. What I see in the film and in thecharacter is so close to Audrey in those moments when she was in turmoil,when there was something she could not resolve.” And Audrey’s son Seanrecalled his mother’s opinion of the picture and her role in it. “I think mymother was proudest of The Nun’s Story. It was a wonderful, serious script,not at all fluffy, and she thought it was an important film.”

Audrey turned twenty-nine during filming and was, as Kathryn Hulmesaid, “hungry for something more.” In the role of Sister Luke, the actress feltthat hunger—she sensed, too, that she was heading somewhere, although thegoal and the direction were unclear and her bearings still unsure.

But one thing was certain: Audrey had to know about her father, whose

death had been rumored among Ella’s friends. She wrote to Mel, asking ifthere was some way to learn more—and to do so without alerting the press.He said he would contact a friend at the International Red Cross, a man whohad located several missing relatives of Hollywood colleagues.

It may or may not be merely coincidental that Audrey’s inquiry to Mel,and her longing to know about her father, coincided exactly with two of thelast scenes she filmed for The Nun’s Story. There had been touchingsequences between her characters and their fathers in Sabrina, War andPeace and Love in the Afternoon, but none were so deeply felt as those in theZinnemann picture.

“Goodbye, Father,” says Gabrielle as she enters the convent. “I’ll do mybest—I want you to be proud of me.”

“I don’t want to be proud of you—I want you to be happy,” he replies.

“I am happy,” she says.

The poignancy of this scene, with the haze of tears in the eyes of bothactors and the gentleness in their voices, is tragically carried forward towardthe end of the film. Sister Luke receives written notice that her father hasbeen gunned down by Nazi soldiers on a road, while he was tending thewounded. Alone in her convent cell, she cries aloud, “Father! Father!Father!”—each time more loudly and desperately. The scene then changes toSister Luke’s conversation with the convent chaplain: she intends to leave thereligious order. As Gabrielle van der Mal, she will take up the struggle begunby her father. Her loss of him is not the sole reason for her departure, but hisdeath at least partly provokes her decision.

Recollecting these scenes is not meant to imply that they were the reasonswhy Audrey wanted to contact her father. But no actor, certainly not one ofher exquisite sensitivity, can leave her personal life and her net of memoriesoutside the studio when she plays a role. Ruston’s disappearance from her liferemained an unresolved source of anguish, a sharp and vivid wound that hadto be healed.

# Chapter Eleven

# July 1958–December 1960

AUDREY COMPLETED HER scenes for The Nun’s Story in late June. For sixmonths, she had worked constantly, but for a few days of illness in Rome andfor travel between filming in Europe and Africa. But as July approached,there was to be no summer holiday, no rest from her exhausting round ofobligations. She had promised Mel that she would play the leading role inGreen Mansions, which, after research and background filming in SouthAmerica, he was ready to direct in Los Angeles, beginning on July 15.Audrey had not worked in Hollywood in five years, since Sabrina; nor wasshe eager to return. En route to Los Angeles, she took a detour to their housein Bürgenstock, where she stocked a dozen large valises full of personaleffects, tableware and bibelots, the better to make their temporary Californiaresidence more homelike.

Mel was probably aware of Audrey’s affair with Robert Anderson. Filmproduction companies have few secrets, and some cast and crew membersknew about her comings and goings. Certainly Fred Zinnemann knew aboutit, for he and Bob were good friends and held each other’s confidence, butothers grasped the situation, too. It is, after all, unusual for a screenwriter tobe present during virtually the entire time of filming—unless the script isfraught with problems and in need of daily improvisation, which was far fromthe case with The Nun’s Story. Anderson and Zinnemann had completed theirresearch journeys well before filming began, and the screenplay was inalmost perfect shape: the writer’s presence for almost all of production had todo with Audrey, not because a few rewrites were necessary here and there;and no other writer worked on it.

More to the point, Audrey gave Anderson the impression that she and Melhad a tacit (or perhaps even an explicit) understanding about extramaritalrelations when they were separated for long periods. The marriage from thesummer of 1959 had a twofold objective—to provide Mel with the cachet ofAudrey’s professional collaboration, and to afford her the opportunity to beara child by a man she knew who was not infertile. She was twenty-nine, shehad endured at least one miscarriage and she began to express considerableanxiety about the prospects for maternity. Perhaps most of all, she believedthat a child would bring to the marriage what she believed she could not.

As for the occupational partnership, Mel’s choice of a literary property forher movie was both comprehensible and bizarre. Published in 1904, GreenMansions was the best-known work by W. H. Hudson, a naturalist andnovelist born in Argentina to American parents. He took British citizenship atthe age of sixty and wrote mostly about subjects having to do with themysteries of nature: Green Mansions found wide readership for decades,especially among young women. The story tells of Abel, a political refugeewho encounters a mysterious teenage girl named Rima in the South Americanrain forest. Her tropical habitat has put her in a kind of mystic communionwith the natural world, but her experience of human love is dormant untilAbel falls in love with her. Much of the novel’s appeal doubtless had to dowith its tragic ending, for Rima is killed by a band of jungle savages.

Since the 1930s, various Hollywood producers and studios believed that alush production of Green Mansions would translate into abundant greencurrency, but their attempts to film it had collapsed when suitable scriptswere not forthcoming. In 1959, movie rights were once again available, butby then it was such a conventional tale that no director was interested. Mel,however, believed it was just the right project for Audrey: her candidingenuousness and her image of maidenly innocence would be just right forthis fey story set in the exotic jungle. And so this was the project chosen tofulfill Audrey’s obligation to MGM (because the rights to Funny Face weresold to Paramount). “I have become greatly dependent on Mel’s taste andguidance,” she said without further explanation.

Casting the hero was easy for Mel: he signed twenty-six-year-old Anthony

Perkins, who readily undertook the chance to play opposite Audrey. Lanky,boyishly earnest and slightly odd, Perkins had played sensitive, sometimesconfused or even aberrant young men on Broadway and in Hollywood.*13 Atthe same time, Dorothy Kingsley—an MGM contract writer available thatseason—was commissioned to create the screenplay. Once a comedy writerfor Bob Hope and Edgar Bergen, Kingsley had written scripts for Metromusicals and for no fewer than seven aquatic spectacles starring EstherWilliams. Perhaps no one would have been the right choice to transfer thisstory to the screen, but Dorothy Kingsley was categorically the wrong one.Her script, approved by the studio and handed over to Mel, was asimpenetrable as its jungle setting. But Mel soldiered on, confident that hecould supply in visual ingenuity what the dialogue, with its long stretches ofsilence, so manifestly lacked. Before a foot of film rolled through the camera,Green Mansions was tangled in creative and commercial troubles.

With his script, his cast in place and his background shots completed inBritish Guiana and Venezuela, Mel began filming Audrey, Anthony Perkinsand the other players not on location in the tropics of South America, noreven in those of Mexico or Florida. The unenchanted forest of the picture wasinstead filmed on Stage 24 of MGM Studios, in Culver City, California.

“Many friends asked me how such an artistically touchy situation wouldturn out,” Audrey said later. “I answered that I wouldn’t know until thepicture was finished. Now I can say that it was pleasantly uncomplicated. Ifound that being directed by Mel was as natural as brushing my teeth.”Audrey’s observation that the endeavor was “pleasantly uncomplicated” andher analogy to routine dental care are remarkable. Had she meant that theproject was rewarding or challenging or in some vague way a step forward inher career, she certainly had the expressive vocabulary to communicate that.Her understatement, on the other hand, is perhaps emblematic of herindifference.

Green Mansions (the first and only time Mel directed his wife) was afailure critically and commercially, notorious for its lack of dramatic tension,its strained dialogue and its supercilious tone: Audrey/Rima: “It is love Ifeel…Now I know that.” It is equally difficult to accept her hysterical

declamations to the spirit of her dead mother. Barefoot throughout, Audreywas made to wear a diaphanous shift and a long, dark wig; the entire effectwas that of an early flower child from Haight-Ashbury. Perhaps mostalarming is the obviously fake studio jungle and the lack of chemistrybetween the principals. Anthony Perkins could not manage to make theshortest love scene credible: kissing Audrey, he seems cool enough to haveair-conditioned all of MGM, and there was much bumping of noses. By thistime, Mel may have lost hope, or in light of so many circumstances, he maynot have wished to direct his wife in a love scene even with so diffident aperformer. Most significantly, Mel was out of his depth as director: thepacing is languid, and the entire film lacks anything like credible emotion.

A movie shot almost completely in the studio could easily have beencompleted in six weeks; in this case, the production shuffled along from July15 to November 6. The day before the first scenes were put on film, Audreydrove as usual from their rented house to the studio. As she approached thecorner of Beverly Drive and Santa Monica Boulevard, a car raced toward herfrom the left. To avoid a collision, Audrey had to speed across theintersection, where she crashed into the rear of a car driven by a womannamed Joan Paladini, a young actress known as Joan Lora. Neither womanwas obviously injured, but a few days later, Mrs. Paladini’s lawyer broughtsuit against Audrey, contending that his client had suffered neck and backinjuries. The matter came to trial over two years later, but on October 25,Audrey appeared in court to give her account; the case was soon dismissed.From July 14, 1958, she never again sat behind the wheel of a car except onscreen.

WHEN GREEN MANSIONS was completed and screened for the studio publicistsearly in December, they had no idea how to promote this dreary, lacklustermovie. Near to desperation, they settled on one production detail. In herforest primeval, Rima is everywhere accompanied by a tiny faun. To ensurethat the animal would stay at Audrey’s side in each scene, she nurtured andraised it before filming began. She then kept it with her at home all during

filming and was seen with the little creature all over town. Hence nationalmagazines carried cute photographs of Audrey and Ip, her name for the faunbecause it uttered high-pitched “ip-ip-ip” sounds.

MGM decided to release Green Mansions as swiftly as possible, at RadioCity Music Hall, New York, on March 19, 1959. During its run there, morethan half of the auditorium’s 6,200 seats remained empty. Fortunately, thefilm’s tepid reception was completely eclipsed by the triumph of The Nun’sStory, which had its premiere at the same theater on June 18. “There wasplenty of excitement at the Music Hall yesterday,” Bob Anderson wrote toKathryn Hulme and Marie Louise Habets on the nineteenth. “The lines werealmost up to Fifth Avenue most of the day, and thousands of people wereturned away. It was one of their biggest opening days…Fred [Zinnemann]and I sat together at the evening show. Of course, The Nun’s Story will neverbe over for us.”

For a month, double lines coiled around the streets of Rockefeller Centerand audiences waited as long as five hours for tickets. The film was extendedto theaters nationwide in July, and as the accountants at Warner Bros.calculated their earnings, it was clear that this was beyond doubt the mostprofitable motion picture in the studio’s history.

THE FERRERS SPENT Thanksgiving with Mel’s children in California and thentraveled for the Christmas holiday to Bürgenstock, where they learned thatAudrey was pregnant. Although she expressed unqualified delight, herprivate reaction was more complicated—indeed, the event seems to havebeen unintended, for in January she was to begin work in Mexico on anarduous movie: a cowboy-and-Indian shoot-’em-up, of all things. Since shehad agreed to do her own horseback riding for the film, it is not likely thatpregnancy, however ultimately desired, was planned for this precise time.

Contrary to much that has been written, Audrey was actually of two mindsabout motherhood at this point in her career. On one hand, she was resolutelydetermined to undertake as wide a variety of challenging roles as possible—

hence, after portraying a nun and a jungle primitive, she accepted the offer toappear in a Western directed by John Huston. Indeed, as she arrived for thefilming in Mexico, she was beginning her third film since the previousJanuary.

At the same time, she said she was desperate to have children—but thetiming had to be carefully planned; indeed, she often said privately that shewas hurrying to complete her contractual obligations so that she might retirepermanently to raise a family. The pregnancy of late 1958 was almostcertainly a surprise in light of the commitments she had already made, whichwould engage her through all of 1959.

HAVING ALREADY DIRECTED twenty films (including The Maltese Falcon, TheTreasure of the Sierra Madre, The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen andMoby Dick), Huston was certainly qualified to manage a dramatic outdoorepic set in the Old West. Nevertheless, something went terribly wrong, and asso often in these cases, the problem was a confusing, illogical stew of a scriptthat was long on atmosphere but short on character development andmotivation.

Soon after filming began, Burt Lancaster, whose production companybacked the film and who had the leading male role, briefly consideredcanceling the picture, but too much was at stake commercially andpersonally. Lillian Gish, then sixty-six, had been D. W. Griffith’s greateststar during the silent screen era; she had appeared in ninety films since herdebut in 1912, and there was little she did not know about moviemaking. Buteven Gish could not understand The Unforgiven—indeed, no one during orafter production had the remotest idea what the title meant. They had allaccepted their roles based on an extended prose summary of the story and theprospect of working with Huston, who assured them that the screenplaywould be finely tuned before the first day of shooting in the desert outsideDurango, Mexico, six hundred miles northwest of Mexico City.

A lucid screenplay was never produced. Writer Ben Maddow (working

from a novel by Alan Le May) had collaborated with Huston before, and theycontinued their efforts day and night in Mexico, but the only result seemed tobe hangovers. In addition, Huston had wanted to make a different film fromthe idea Maddow had sold to MGM. Audrey and Lillian tried to counter theiranxieties with whispered black humor about the picture—to the annoyance ofHuston.

The project was virtually impossible to salvage. Audrey, who had littlemore to do than react to events around her, was woefully miscast in the roleof a prairie girl who learns that she is really a Kiowa Indian. Occasionally,she managed the hint of a midwestern twang, but for the most part, shesounded like a perfectly polished maiden home from a British boardingschool. To make matters worse, her makeup was surprisingly irregular: forsome sequences, her skin was painted as dark as a Native American’s; forothers, she seems as fair as an English rose. Nor was she assisted by thefatuity of a film in which apparently important characters appear anddisappear and—marvelous to relate—a herd of cattle somehow leaps fromthe ground onto the roof of a house and then to an adjacent overhangingprecipice. Equally nonsensical are scenes in which Lillian Gish, in defianceof Indian drums, plays Mozart on an antique piano that has conveniently beenleft outdoors, presumably just for this disputatious purpose.

A terrifying accident interrupted filming on January 28. Huston set up ascene in which Audrey was to ride her horse close to the camera and thendismount. After several attempts to get the shot right, horse and riderapproached the proper spot. At that point, a member of the crew jumped infront of the horse, waving his arms to signal the animal to stop. Instead, thehorse bucked, and Audrey went flying through the air, landing on the groundwith a terrifying thud. In horrific pain, she was frightened that she would loseher baby; everyone else feared that she was paralyzed.

Neither mishap occurred, but there was serious injury. Rushed to a hospitalin Durango, she awaited her husband and a doctor, who flew down next dayfrom Los Angeles, where Mel was completing a role in The World, the Fleshand the Devil. With the two men was Marie Louise Habets, whom Mel hadtelephoned and who had immediately offered her nursing skills. She lovingly

attended Audrey for the next month, both in Mexico and in California.

After several days of tests in Durango, it was finally determined thatAudrey had four fractured vertebrae and a badly sprained foot. On February2, she was flown in an ambulance airplane to Beverly Hills for treatment andrest. “I’ll ride that horse again before the picture is finished,” the game girltold waiting reporters. To her immense relief, she had not lost the baby.

Without complaint or requests for special treatment, Audrey returned toMexico and The Unforgiven on March 5 and resumed her role four days later,riding the horse, as she had promised. By this time, her job was onlysomething to be endured.

Twenty years later, Huston was both forthright and on the mark. Afterdescribing Audrey’s accident and the near-drowning of two actors, headmitted that “in the end, the worst of it was the picture we made. Some ofmy pictures I don’t care for, but The Unforgiven is the only one I actuallydislike…the overall tone is bombastic and over-inflated [like DimitriTiomkin’s musical score, he might have added]…I watched it on televisionone night recently, and after about half a reel [ten minutes], I had to turn thedamned thing off. I couldn’t bear it.”

Critics and public were likewise unimpressed when the film opened inApril 1960. “Ludicrous, feeble and disconcerted” were typical adjectivesused in America, while the British press lamented the film’s“portentousness.” Even Audrey could not escape reproach: “She is just a littleless incongruous than the grand piano,” wrote a London reviewer. (“But thehorses are vigorous,” observed The New York Times coolly.)

Fulfilling his contractual obligation, Mel left Mexico on March 11 topromote the unfortunate Green Mansions. Audrey completed the Hustonpicture in April and joined Mel in New York; together, they returned toSwitzerland to await the birth of their baby.

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, Audrey had hoped to appear in a film directed by AlfredHitchcock, and during the mid-1950s, she pursued that idea after admiringseveral of his recent pictures (especially Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, TheMan Who Knew Too Much and North by Northwest, which she saw in apreview screening in New York and which followed The Nun’s Story into theMusic Hall). Since November 1958, Hitchcock had been working with noneother than Samuel Taylor (author of Sabrina Fair) on the screen version ofHenry Cecil’s novel No Bail for the Judge. This was the story of a Londonmagistrate, wrongly accused of a murder but ultimately saved from thegallows when his daughter goes underground to smoke out the real villain inthe demimonde of London’s prostitutes.

After learning of Audrey’s interest in working with him, Hitchcock (whocoincidentally had a deal with Paramount) proceeded with her in mind to playthe loyal and resourceful daughter. After reading Hitchcock’s summary of thestory in February 1959, she signed a contract to star in his picture. At thesame time, Laurence Harvey consented to play her accomplice and loveinterest; and John Williams, who had portrayed her father in Sabrina, agreedto do so again, this time as the beleaguered judge. Production was to begin inLondon that summer, with Audrey’s participation as soon as possible, verylikely in late August or early September, after her baby’s birth.*14

She was resting at Villa Bethania, Bürgenstock, when, on May 11, KurtFrings sent a telegram to Paramount’s vice president, Y. Frank Freeman,confirming that Audrey would indeed “comply with [her] contractualobligations” to appear in No Bail for the Judge late that summer. Frings senta copy of this message to Audrey.

But then she did something uncharacteristic. Unwilling to proceedimmediately from the imminent delivery of her child to another filmassignment—and thus to short-circuit what she anticipated as the joyful firstdays of motherhood—Audrey informed Frings, on May 19, that she wouldnot appear in the Hitchcock picture after all. The stated reason for this, whichFrings issued to the press, was that her doctors ordered complete rest untiland for some time after the baby’s birth. That was true—but it was not thewhole story.

Since Sabrina, Audrey had the privilege of script approval beforebeginning work. On or about May 15, Paramount sent her the draft of No Bailfor the Judge, in which her character was to be nearly strangled with anecktie. This upset her enormously: variety she savored, but violence like thisshe loathed. “When she read it,” said Herbert Coleman, Hitchcock’s associateproducer, “that was it—the Hitchcock film was virtually canceled from thatminute.” Instead of asking Frings to negotiate the matter with Hitchcock, shesimply withdrew from the production tout court— doubtless very muchaware that the scene was central to the film and that Hitchcock did notwelcome story counsel from actors.*15 When he learned of Audrey’sdefection, Laurence Harvey also withdrew, and Hitchcock canceled theproduction.

For years it was said—primarily by Hitchcock—that the departure of histwo leading players was the reason that he could not proceed with No Bail forthe Judge. But that is not the case. For one thing, Hitchcock very often lostactors he had counted on to work in this or that film—most recently, forexample, he had prepared Vertigo (also written with Samuel Taylor) for VeraMiles; when she announced the pregnancy that forced her to withdraw fromthe film, Hitchcock offered the role to Kim Novak. The decision to shelve NoBail was finally made, as Taylor recalled, for quite another reason. Recentlaws in Britain exacted harsh penalties against prostitutes for publicsolicitation. Important scenes in No Bail depended on candid importuningand were thus rendered implausible by the new ordinances. More to the point,Hitchcock intended to shoot these scenes on location in London, and in 1959,authorities informed Paramount that they would not approve the filming ofsuch sequences. This chain of events, rather than Audrey’s decision alone,sabotaged the picture.

A FEW DAYS LATER, Audrey went into labor, but with a sad outcome—thechild was stillborn. The loss pitched her into a depression so acute that Melfeared for her emotional and mental stability. She smoked more than threepacks of cigarettes a day, bit her nails to the quick and weighed little more

than eighty pounds; suddenly, at thirty, she looked much older. “I still mustspend much time in bed,” she wrote to Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopperin June, “but I am filled with gratitude that I can have others—and for myhusband, [a] gentle and tender nurse.”

With the approval of her doctors, she agreed to attend the London premiereof The Nun’s Story in July. “Audrey looked beautiful but a bit weak,” RenéeZinnemann wrote to Kate and Lou. From there, the Ferrers went on toIreland, where—after a year of effort—Mel’s contact in the International RedCross had finally tracked Audrey’s father.

They arranged to meet Ruston in Dublin, where he lived with his wife,Fidelma Walshe. The reunion, in the lobby lounge of the Shelbourne Hotel,was unrelievedly awkward, without warmth or tears or a sense ofreconciliation. In the words of his grandson, Audrey’s father was “totallydisconnected, as he had been for most of his life…in reality an emotionalinvalid.” When they finally met, according to the grandson, “she realized thatwhether he had been there or not, it wouldn’t have made a difference. He wasan emotionally scarred man, and he never would have been the kind of fathershe wanted. She made peace with that.”

Audrey left feeling that there had been no establishment at all of therelationship that never was. “We can go home now,” she said quietly to Melas they left the hotel. But her efforts, and her sheer generosity toward theman, never ceased: she sent a monthly stipend for the rest of his life; shewrote letters to him and Fidelma over several years; and she visited him onceagain, not long before his death.

AUDREY HAD ACCEPTED an invitation to appear in an upcoming issue ofHarper’s Bazaar, and her morale improved when she and Mel proceededfrom Dublin to Paris. There, Richard Avedon photographed her over severaldays as she wore eighteen outfits by Dior, Guy Laroche and Pierre Cardin.(Givenchy’s absence was occasioned only because he was not among those tobe included in the magazine’s September issue.) They then returned to Villa

Bethania before driving to Montreux, on the shores of Lake Léman, whereMel met with Dorothy Kingsley to discuss a movie project that nevermaterialized. When they returned home, Mel replied on August 14 to a letterfrom Kate and Lou. “Audrey badly needs to catch her breath,” he noted. Shedid just that when the Zinnemanns, whom she loved dearly, arrived for a five-day visit; Renée dispatched household chores and Fred created a relaxedatmosphere in their home while Mel fielded telephone calls and tried toconfirm several deals for future work. “Audrey looks brown and healthynow,” Renée wrote to Kate and Lou on August 23.

By November, the Ferrers were in Los Angeles, where Mel tried to findmovies to direct even while he was acting on television. “Audrey lookssuperb,” wrote Kate to the Zinnemanns, “and seems to be enjoying hermomentary rest period with no film in the works as yet.”

The respite from work was prolonged once again by doctors’ orders: inLos Angeles, Audrey again learned she was pregnant. She and Mel returnedto Villa Bethania for Christmas, and there she remained, in almost cloisteredseclusion.

ON APRIL 4, 1960—the date for bestowing the annual Academy Awards—Audrey wrote a five-page letter, in her own clear handwriting, to MarieLouise Habets:

Dearest most precious Lou,

Tonight is the big night and you will all know the results when we aresnoozing away…No news will ever be more glorious for me, though, thanwhen I heard I was going to play Lou/Luke—or when you said you’d comeand nurse my broken back (and me)….

I long for many accolades for Fred—he worked so hard and so tirelessly

and with such devotion, pouring his soul and endless sensitive talent intosomething of which he had a vision no amount of Warner Bros. pressure wasever allowed to blur or distort for him. As for you two angels with gallantsouls and witty tongues—no one will ever know how much you have meantand been to it [the film] and us all….

All all all our love—

Audrey.

The next message to Lou and Kate was a telegram from Mel, dated July17, 1960—from the Lucerne Maternity Clinic:

BOY SEAN BORN TWO FORTY THIS AFTERNOON NINEPOUNDS AUDREY BEATIFICALLY HAPPY LOVE MEL.

The two women replied at once:

WE HAVE DISPATCHED SEVEN THOUSAND GOOD FAIRIES TOSTAND AROUND SEAN’S CRADLE. WE REJOICE MADLY FORYOU THREE—LOVE LOU AND KATE.

Wearing a baptismal robe specially designed for him by Givenchy, theinfant was christened Sean Hepburn Ferrer, in the same chapel and by thesame clergyman who had presided at the wedding in 1954. “On a brilliantSunday, after a rainstorm, our strong, well-made son was born,” Audrey saidyears later. “Like all new mothers, I couldn’t believe, at first, that he wasreally for me and that I could keep him…Even when I was little, what Iwanted most was to have a child…And I wanted lots of babies. That’s been atheme in my life…I’m sure it’s wonderful when you’re 18—but if you waityears, the joy is impossible to describe…My miscarriages were more painfulto me than anything, ever—including my parents’ divorce and thedisappearance of my father. From the time I had Sean, I hung onto mymarriage because of him, and more and more, I began to resent the time Ispent away from him on location. That was always the real me. The movieswere fairy tales.”

Strongly recommended by Mel, the next fairy tale required Audrey to beon location in New York and then in Paramount’s Hollywood studios fromOctober to the end of the year. They traveled together, for he had all sorts ofmovie projects on the boil, and both baby and nanny went along.

But Audrey was, once again, of divided mind. She did not want to work,but she wanted to work; tempted to play it safe, she simultaneously wantedalways to attempt something new. She wanted to be a full-time mother, butshe knew that, at thirty-one, good roles would not always be offered, and soshe was responsive to Mel’s persuasion to reach for a new gold ring. Inaddition, she needed the money—not to indulge her whims, but for her son’sfuture.

Audrey’s work in New York and Los Angeles that autumn was for whatbecame her signature role—Holly Golightly, in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, thepicture that immediately erased the critical and popular disappointment overGreen Mansions and The Unforgiven. Thanks to the wardrobe designed byher friend Givenchy, the picture made her a fashion icon forevermore: inBreakfast, her status as the reigning queen of chic surpassed even the positionshe attained through what, by contrast, seemed the black-and-whiteconstraints of Sabrina. Audrey was henceforth considered a key arbiter,standard and model of elegance and vogue. That this should have been abyproduct of Breakfast at Tiffany’s is, in a way, the height of improbability,for in it she portrayed a prostitute—or tried to. Audrey’s Holly may onoccasion be a garrulous, silly girl, but she could not make audiences believethat she sold herself for cash. Publicity photos showed her overdraped withropes of faux jewelry, and soon Tiffany’s saw a good opportunity and askedher to accept a handsome contract to advertise for the store. “My image willnever be Miss Diamonds,” she said, rejecting the offer.

Based on a hundred-page novella by Truman Capote, the film altered thebook a great deal. The finished product concerns Holly Golightly, once ateenage Texas bride named Lulamae Barnes, a girl of poor and murkybackground who comes to New York, and longing to marry (eventually) therichest man in the world, she plies the world’s oldest profession. Her onlyconstant companion is a nameless cat she picks up. Sometimes Holly returns

to her apartment from a liaison just as people are beginning their workday,and then she munches breakfast right on the street in early daylight, gazingavariciously at the jewelry in Tiffany’s showcase windows, as in the firstscene.

Holly meets a struggling young writer named Paul (played by GeorgePeppard), whose struggles are alleviated by the subsidies he receives from awealthy, predatory older, unnamed woman (Patricia Neal). The writer fallsfor Holly, who is interested only in jewelry and cash but not love and stability—until the last moments of the picture. Capote’s story was both acerbicallywitty and affectingly simple, cool in its assessment of lost souls yet warm inthe author’s sympathetic character delineation. The movie exchanged theedge and the subtlety for a celebration of New York and a comic infatuationfor Audrey Hepburn.

“I read the book and liked it very much,” she said. “But I was terriblyafraid I was not right for the part. I thought I lacked the right sense ofcomedy. This part called for an extroverted character. I am an introvert. Buteveryone pressed me to do it. So I did. I suffered through it all. I lost weight.Very often while I was doing the part, I was convinced I was not doing thebest job.”

It was precisely this disconnection that made her uneasy. “Despite herobvious insecurities, there was a strong core to Audrey,” recalled directorBlake Edwards. Those insecurities were evident almost from the first day ofwork. Edwards had to reassure her—as he did when he and composer HenryMancini informed her that a song was being especially composed for her tosing while accompanying herself on a guitar. The prospect of this intimidatedAudrey, for her voice had darkened and become thinner since Funny Face;accordingly, she studied with a vocal coach and a guitar teacher for weeks,delaying the recording of “Moon River” until she felt less uncomfortable.

Mancini encouraged her: the melody was limited to a one-octave range, hesaid, and that could be transposed down if necessary. “I knew what to writeby reading the script,” Mancini recalled. “And Audrey’s big eyes gave me thepush to get a little more sentimental than I usually am. Those eyes of hers

could carry it, I knew that. ‘Moon River’ [with lyrics by Johnny Mercer] waswritten for her. No one else ever understood it so completely.”

When the film was previewed for the Paramount brass the followingspring, Mel and Audrey were present. “One thing’s for sure,” said MartinRackin, head of Paramount production, at the conclusion of the screening.“That fucking song’s gotta go!” According to Mancini, Audrey sprang fromher chair, and Mel had to restrain her. “Over my dead body!” she cried, hervoice trembling. The song, of course, stayed in the picture.

From the day Breakfast at Tiffany’s was released, the image of AudreyHepburn, sitting at her open window, strumming her guitar and singing“Moon River” in her tentative, wistful mezzo, is perhaps the single mostenduring emblem of the enchantment she brought to a legion of moviegoers,then and later. Without pretense or pose, she seemed through the music tosuggest a fusion of reminiscence, of loss and of longing that even Hollycannot quite fathom. Indeed, we are not listening to Holly singing: this isAudrey, and it is her song, delivered directly from her own introspectivepersonality. According to everything that precedes and follows it, Hollycould not be still for the length of any melody. And absent “Moon River,” infact, Audrey rarely seems at home in this expensive, fabricated escapade. Herrendition of the song, which Mancini always considered the best among morethan five hundred renditions, was certainly a factor when she was nominatedby the Academy as best actress—for a fourth time. (Sophia Loren won, forTwo Women.)

Although the song was not excised, battles still raged, for Paramountwanted to cut a major portion of Mancini’s atmospheric (but often excessive)background music. In this Audrey demonstrated what Edwards called her“strong core,” sending pleading and even angry memoranda in support ofMancini, to whom she then wrote:

A movie without music is like an aeroplane without fuel. However beautifullythe job is done, we are still on the ground and in a world of reality. Your

music has lifted us all up and sent us soaring. Everything we cannot say withwords or show with action you have expressed for us. You have done thiswith so much imagination, fun and beauty. You are the hippest of cats—andthe most sensitive of composers! Thank you, dear Hank.

Lots of love,

Audrey

For the most part, relations during production were friendly—except forGeorge Peppard and Blake Edwards, who disagreed openly. Audrey andPatricia Neal, however, became friends, and one evening Audrey invited herhome for dinner. “I remember our supper was on a work night,” according toNeal. “Mel was very strict with her during production, so the evening wasone drink, a light meal, and good night. I don’t think the sun had set by thetime I got home.”

IN THE TRANSFER from page to screen, there were major alterations to Holly’scharacter, to the tone of the story, and to its melancholy finale. “The bookwas really rather bitter,” said Capote, “and Holly Golightly was real—a toughcharacter, not an Audrey Hepburn type at all. Marilyn Monroe was my firstchoice to play her. I thought she would be perfect for the part. Holly had tohave something touching about her—unfinished. Marilyn had that. ButParamount double-crossed me and gave the part to Audrey Hepburn.” Capotealso regretted that Hollywood turned his seriocomic tale of a lonely, restlessManhattan call girl into “a mawkish valentine to New York City.”

In addition, the movie changed the book’s dispassionate narrator into theyoung writer played by Peppard, who is subsidized by a wealthy woman hesubsequently leaves when he falls for Holly. At the end of the book, Holly isabandoned by her Brazilian fiancé but nevertheless flies off to South America

and continues onward from there (as we learn summarily from the narrator atthe end), in a constant cycle of seeking and losing and traveling. In the film,however, she is abandoned by her Brazilian fiancé but then accepts the loveof the writer. The final raining scene on the page is part of the story’s ruefulmelancholy; the drizzly conclusion on the screen shows the lovers kissingpassionately, lushly attended by Mancini’s romantic music.

The riot of colors used for Breakfast at Tiffany’s, the high style ofAudrey’s outfits and coiffures, the surprising character she agreed to portray,the impossible romance of the story in light of its bold content: theseelements were irresistible to audiences in 1961. Entertainingly packaged, theyattracted a new generation of moviegoers at a time when America wasdeveloping new fancies for everything from food and drink to music andmovies, from social aspirations to economic expectations. And thefoundations were only just beginning to shake.

Director Blake Edwards and screenwriter George Axelrod knew preciselyhow to ensure the movie’s success and yet remain within the boundaries ofconvention. They counterpoised sophomoric vulgarity with down-homesweetness—the former in recurring scenes with a grotesque Japaneseneighbor, ludicrously overplayed by Mickey Rooney; and the latter in theromantic final sequence, which gave Audrey her best moment in the film.

AUL: Holly, I’m in love with you!

OLLY: So what?

AUL: So what? So plenty! I love you—you belong to me!

OLLY: No, people don’t belong to people.

AUL: Of course they do!

OLLY: I’m not going to let anyone put me in a cage!

AUL: I don’t want to put you in a cage—I want to love you!

OLLY: It’s the same thing.

AUL: No, it’s not! Holly—

OLLY (crying aloud): I’m not Holly! I’m not Lulamae, either—I don’t knowwho I am! I’m like Cat here—we’re a couple of no-name slobs. We don’tbelong to anyone and no one belongs to us—we don’t even belong to eachother!

There was a moving arc of authentic sentiment when Audrey sang “MoonRiver,” and, in the finale, there is a heartbreaking plangency to her outburst.Never mind that her Holly is not the book’s: Audrey rendered this confusedgirl—who is not yet a woman—as a credible, needy soul. Paul finds herirresistible and so, just in time, does the audience.

DESPITE CHARACTERS fundamentally driven by venality and sexualcommercialism, the film neatly exemplifies a venerable Hollywood doublestandard. Wild parties, drunkenness, exotic dancers, sexual freewheeling andan egregious kind of selfish autonomy are presented as merely the high jinksof New York sophisticates—but at the end, orthodox propriety is (howeverimplausibly) affirmed by the two lovers. They remain fixed in our memories,drenched by rain as if it were a sign of heavenly benediction. A dependablemovie cliché, the last scene affected millions of moviegoers in 1961; yearslater, is still seems, for the most part, astonishingly foolproof.

# Chapter Twelve

1961–1962

DURING THE CHRISTMAS holidays at Villa Bethania, Audrey received hergratifying reviews for Breakfast at Tiffany’s, which had its premiere theprevious October, and her fourth Oscar nomination was announced later thatwinter. Mel, meanwhile, still hoped—in vain, as it turned out—that one of hiswriting and directorial projects would come to fruition. “It was not easy forMel,” said Hubert de Givenchy, discreetly terse.

“Of course it’s a problem when the wife outshines the husband as Audreydoes me,” Mel admitted, as if he were elaborating on Givenchy’s statement.“I’m pretty sensitive when producers call me up and say they want to discussa film with me, when in reality they’re angling for Audrey and using me asbait.” As for Green Mansions, he was a master of understatement: “It was nota great success.”

Meanwhile, close friends of the Ferrers, and visitors to Bürgenstock, knewwhat was happening that year. As Audrey continued to be in demand, Melhad only the second-rate occupations of acting in minor European horrorfilms and grade-B costume dramas—“work acting,” he called it in a letter toKathryn Hulme and Marie Louise Habets on March 7, 1961. But there were,it seems, social diversions: he was photographed, merry and mannerly asalways, squiring female co-stars with whom he briefly worked on one pictureor another. “Pretense that all was well [between Mel and Audrey] becamepatently absurd,” wrote Joseph Barry, a journalist who knew them both.

The tensions were certainly at least partly responsible for Audrey’s almostconstant anxiety. “Audrey has been the cook here for us all,” Mel added in

his letter of March 7, “so I am afraid she has not put on any of those kilos thatSean has packed on so rapidly—he is over ten kilos and has six teeth.” OnMarch 8, mother, father, baby and nanny went to Rome, where Mel wascompleting his scenes in a picture and where, as he wrote to friends, he hopedAudrey would indulge in the pasta she so loved and thus regain a few pounds.She ate it, but no weight was added.

Her extreme thinness was evident even beneath the neck-to-knee costumesprepared for her next picture. In that, she was to wear a simple shirtwaistdress, a suit and a wool sheath—none of them amplifying or flattering herreed-thin figure. These outfits, completely deglamorizing her as had SisterLuke’s habit, were designed for her first black-and-white movie in five years:a film of Lillian Hellman’s first play, The Children’s Hour.

In agreeing to assume the role of Karen Wright, Audrey was to portray yetanother controversial figure, as she had in The Unforgiven and Breakfast atTiffany’s. Shirley MacLaine, five years Audrey’s junior, was to be her co-star, in the part of Martha Dobie.

Screenwriter John Michael Hayes was remarkably faithful to the play.Karen and Martha, friends since college, administer a small boarding schoolfor girls. One of their young charges, a spoiled, willful and spiteful child,concocts a rumor that Karen and Martha are lovers. Horrified, parents andrelatives at once withdraw their children from the school, despite the fierceand truthful denial of this gossip by the two women. Even Karen’s fiancé istainted by the general suspicion. Finally, Martha believes that perhaps therumor has some foundation: in an emotional scene, she admits to Karen thatshe has indeed had romantic but unexpressed feelings for her friend. Fearingthe loss of friendship and deprived of her career, Martha takes her own life.

The strength of both play and film was its interweaving of three narrativeplanes. First, there is the action of a malicious child who fabricates adestructive rumor. Second, there is the devastating influence of gullible andintolerant adults, quick to believe a mendacious child and to ostracize womenthey wrongly believe to be lovers. Third, there is the ironic truth that thescandal forces Martha to admit to herself that she has had a sentimental

attachment to Karen.

Two years after the successful Broadway premiere in 1934, William Wylerhad filmed a screen version of it, but the newly enforced Motion PictureProduction Code imposed such constraints that These Three, as it was titled,became the rather tame story of a heterosexual love triangle—not a powerfuldissection of the spite, prejudice, intolerance and rumor that can ruin lives.Twenty-five years later, Wyler now wanted to revisit the play, and he quicklyobtained Audrey’s consent to participate: after all, he had guided her to anOscar for Roman Holiday, and she trusted him and his creative judgment.

And so, by late March, the Ferrers were back in Hollywood, again stayingat the home of Deborah Kerr on Kemridge Road, in the mountains aboveBeverly Hills. (Kerr was making several films back to back in England andwas pleased to have her friends in residence.) John Michael Hayes, whosemany worthy credits included four superb scripts for Alfred Hitchcock, gaveWyler the finished screenplay for The Children’s Hour on May 15, and aweek later, rehearsals began at the Goldwyn Studios in Hollywood.

After a mutually cautious introduction, the two leading ladies establishedan easy rapport, and neither of them was at all squeamish about her role. “Iconceived Martha’s character,” recalled Shirley MacLaine, “to lovingly buildher adoration and emotional involvement with the character of Karen so thatthe audience would realize early on what was going on. In fact, Martha wasunaware of her feelings…until the little girl exaggerated Martha’s behaviorinto a lie. Within that lie was the ounce of truth.”

But when Wyler saw the first cut of the picture, he feared the film wouldnot receive a seal of approval from the Motion Picture Production Code,which expressly forbade any story about (or that even mentioned)homosexuality; the lack of the Code’s seal would mean that the movie couldnot be screened in almost every American theater. “Willy got cold feet aboutthe lesbian subject,” MacLaine continued. “He cut out all the scenes thatportrayed Martha falling in love with Karen.” Scenes in which Marthalovingly cared for Karen’s clothes, brushed her hair, baked cookies for her—all these were excised. “In eliminating those scenes, Willy gutted the

intention of the film”—and if not the intention, surely the helpful signs to theaudience of Martha’s growing attachment that would have made the finaldeclaration of love more credible, not to say more sympathetic. If audienceshad been shown the poignancy of the situation—even in 1961—they mightnot have been so alienated from the tragedy.

But apart from the commercial expediency that forced Wyler’s editorialhand, there may well have been another reason for the excisions hemandated. After all, Wyler understood the ambiguities of Hellman’s play andwanted to preserve them in his film. Martha may of course be regarded as arepressed lesbian, forced to confront her true feelings for Karen only whenthere is the ill-founded rumor of romance. But the dialogue suggests thatMartha thinks the accusation may be true only when it is made:

ARTHA: There’s always been something wrong.

AREN: Stop the crazy talk.

ARTHA: I’m guilty.

AREN: You’re guilty of nothing!

ARTHA: I’ve been telling myself that since the night we heard the child say it—I’ve been praying I could convince myself of it. I can’t, I can’t any longer.It’s there. I don’t know how, I don’t know why. But I did love you. I do loveyou. I resented your marriage—maybe because I wanted you.

AREN: It’s a lie. You’re telling yourself a lie. We never thought of each otherthat way.

ARTHA: No, of course you didn’t. But who says I didn’t? I never felt that wayabout anybody but you. I’ve never loved a man. I never knew why before.Maybe it’s that.

AREN: You are tired and sick.

ARTHA: It’s funny—it’s all mixed up. There’s something in you, and you don’tknow anything about it because you don’t know it’s there. I couldn’t call it byname before, but I know now. It’s there. It’s been there ever since I firstknew you. I don’t know. It all seems to come back to me. I’ve ruined yourlife and I’ve ruined my own. Oh, I feel so damn sick and dirty I can’t stand itanymore!

AREN: All this isn’t true. You’ve never said it—we’ll forget it by tomorrow.

Martha moves from “maybe” to certainty—but it is “all mixed up.” Seenfrom this perspective, Martha is like an innocent and wrongly convictedprisoner who feels guilty for something she now feels she is somehowresponsible for. The guilt then enables her to see everything in her past assupportive of her interpretation of the present. One of the merits of Wyler’sThe Children’s Hour (released in Great Britain as The Loudest Whisper) isthat it mostly maintains these ambiguities. On the one hand, the ironictragedy of the situation is that a lie exposes a grain of truth; on the otherhand, the lie is so monstrous that it unbalances a lonely woman and forcesher, quite wrongly, to believe that her “unnatural” self deserves death.However one takes the characters, the play (as critic and historian BernardDick has rightly said) “is about the effects of a lie that activates suppressedfeelings that suddenly surface when one is faced with an accusation ofsomething that is not true, but could be.”

Matching Shirley MacLaine beat for beat, Audrey gave her most centeredand delicately shaded performance since The Nun’s Story. Disalloweddesigner clothes, she relied only on the subtlest facial expression of innerconfusion and on effective variations in vocal tone; the result was a characterof moving and remarkable density. Her scenes with recalcitrant pupils, forexample, have no touch of the movie schoolmarm; her love scenes with herfiancé (James Garner) have an exquisite physical tenderness hitherto unseenin any of her films; her icy indictment of bigotry is tinged with the rightamount of pain; and her deep love for her friend is everywhere evident. Thislast achievement makes almost unbearable her discovery of Martha’s body.

Audrey’s tears, her shutting of the eyes against the horror of what she hasseen, the modulation of her voice from shrieking cries to muted sobs—this isa moment that could be beneficially studied by all students of film acting.Wyler considered her achievement nothing less than brilliant.

Decades later, Audrey’s acting and the film are, unjustifiably, held in lowesteem. The reason for the critical disfavor may be a triumph of what hasbeen called political correctness. For one thing, audiences for the most partaccept neither the apparent passivity of the young women nor Martha’ssuicide. Homosexuals certainly ought not to be driven to suicide because ofignorant social censure, so (the reasoning runs) they ought not to be showncommitting suicide. That objection misses the point: Martha has lost hercareer and is afraid to lose her friend, who is about to marry. The dramashows what occasionally pushes people beyond their endurance. In the finalanalysis, The Children’s Hour reveals not what all of life is like, but whatsome of life is like, and what all life is in constant danger of becoming—inthis case, a sacrifice to cruelty, bigotry, deceit and self-hatred. Hellman haddrawn her title from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whose 1860 poem of thesame name describes a devoted father’s late afternoons with his three youngdaughters:

Between the dark and the daylight,

When the night is beginning to lower,

Comes a pause in the day’s occupations,

That is known as the Children’s Hour.

The dramatic situation, however, had been inspired by something far darker:an incident in Scotland, in 1810, in which a schoolgirl accused her teachers oflesbianism. The child’s grandmother spread the libel and ruined the

The film was completed in mid-August, and on Saturday, September 2, theFerrers left for a month in Villa Bethania. Three days before their departure,Audrey wrote to Marie Louise—“just to tell you and Kate [Hulme] howmuch we love you both.”

AUDREY, SEAN AND the nanny spent the six weeks in Rome because Mel wasthere completing scenes in I lancieri neri (The Black Lancers), and they thenaccompanied him to Paris for his work in The Longest Day. From this time,Audrey traveled economy class by air and purchased only a Volvo or Audi,not a large, expensive car—which someone would have had to drive, for shewas fearful after the accident in Beverly Hills.

There was additional companionship: Audrey’s beloved Yorkshire terrier,named Famous, had been killed after darting into Los Angeles traffic; Melreplaced the loss with a puppy of the same breed, Assam—a name based onthe Sanskrit word for “irregular,” and so named by its breeder because ofslightly irregular eyes and ears. Until the following spring, the family’s onlytime in Bürgenstock was a week at Christmas.

During that holiday, Audrey’s publicist, Henry Rogers, visited VillaBethania. After lunch, Mel began to discuss his wife’s future roles—what headvised, what he urged her to consider and, incidentally, what did Henrythink? Audrey, meanwhile, continued to feed Sean. “She was alwaysreluctant to get into discussions of this sort and was angry with Mel and me,”Rogers recalled.

Then Mel changed the subject. He had always resented that Audreyreceived no compensation for allowing Givenchy to use her name andlikeness to promote L’Interdit, the perfume created in her honor: “ForChrist’s sake, Henry, she doesn’t even get a discount on the clothes hedesigns for her. As for the perfume, wouldn’t you think he would send hergallons of it—as a gift? She buys it herself—retail!”

Rogers had just come from a meeting in Paris with Givenchy about thisvery matter: unknown to Audrey, Mel had asked him to work out some kindof honorarium—which Givenchy had readily agreed to do.

“Neither of you seems to understand,” Audrey interjected. “I don’t wantanything from Hubert. I don’t need his money—he’s my friend. If I’vehelped him build his perfume business, then that’s exactly what one friendshould do for another. If someone else offered me a million dollars to endorsea perfume, I wouldn’t do it—but Hubert is my friend. I don’t want anything.Yes, I even want to walk into a drugstore and buy the perfume at the retailprice.”

At that moment, another guest arrived, on schedule—Robert Favre LeBret, general administrator of the Cannes Film Festival, who was trying toconvince Audrey to attend the opening ceremonies the following spring.Rogers was opposed to the idea: she had no film coming to the festival, andshe neither desired nor needed the publicity. Rogers added that Audrey’spresence would be criticized as a bid for publicity, and that she wouldoutshine the younger actresses who would be there to promote their films andcareers.

Mel persisted, pushing Rogers to withdraw into another room andnegotiate a deal for Audrey’s visit to the festival. “Le Bret is very important,Henry,” said Mel, “and he wants her very badly. Maybe someday we’ll needa favor from him.” Audrey, indifferent to the entire matter, took Sean up tobed.

“I need a reason for her to attend,” Rogers told Favre Le Bret, “otherwisein all good conscience I cannot recommend to Audrey that she should attendyour opening.” After some time, the two men agreed that she could indeedattend if she were to receive a special tribute as one who had madeoutstanding contributions to the international cinema—this would be thebeginning of a tradition, said Rogers.

Late that afternoon, Rogers departed for London. In his hotel room earlynext morning, he took a call from Audrey, who was sobbing: she had been up

all night, she had not slept, she was miserable. “You know how much I careabout you,” she said, her voice choked with weeping, “and how much I valueyour friendship. I’m crying because I have decided that I don’t want you torepresent me anymore. I won’t hire anyone else. I just can’t stand any moreof this. I just don’t like what is happening to me, and my life and my friends.”

Rogers had no idea what she meant.

“First you embarrassed me with Hubert. You and Mel made such a thingabout his taking advantage of me, and I told you—I don’t care. He’s myfriend. And last night, after you left, it was terrible. I was embarrassed. I wasashamed. I started to cry and ran out of the room. Favre Le Bret told me youhad tried to blackmail him, that you told him the only way I would go to theCannes Film Festival would be if he gave me some kind of phony, trumped-up award. Henry, I don’t want you to work for me anymore.” There was apause, but Rogers heard her weeping still—and then she said, “Henry, willyou still be my friend?”

“Of course we will be friends,” Rogers said gently, and he apologizedprofusely for causing her embarrassment when all he wished to do was to bea good publicist. “But before we finish this conversation, Audrey, you mustunderstand one thing. You have known me for many years. You know how Iwork. You know very well that I never tried to blackmail Favre Le Bret. If heis stupid enough to interpret my proposal, which was good for him and goodfor you, in that way, then I never want anything to do with him again—andyou shouldn’t, either.” Audrey did not attend the Cannes Film Festival.

“It was frustrating to do what I had felt was right for my client and thenhave it boomerang against me,” Rogers reflected years later. Had he not metwith Givenchy in Paris at Mel’s behest, had he known beforehand thatAudrey did not want to be compensated for her perfume endorsement, “and ifI had merely told Le Bret, ‘No, Audrey won’t attend your opening nightceremonies,’ [then] I would have still retained her as a client.” He did not,however, lose her friendship.

BECAUSE AUDREY HAD accepted MGM’s additional offer of The Unforgivenafter Green Mansions, and because she had also gone to an independentcompany for The Children’s Hour, she owed Paramount another picture. Thehead of production, Martin Rackin (who had disliked “Moon River”), learnedfrom his contracts department that William Holden had an identicalobligation to the studio. A deal was made to put the two stars together in amovie Rackin and company believed could not miss: an American remake ofa successful French romantic comedy, Julien Duvivier’s La fête à Henriette(Holiday for Henrietta). George Axelrod, who had created the script forBreakfast at Tiffany’s, was the writer, and Richard Quine, with some recentlight comedies to his credits, was assigned to direct the satire, called Paris—When It Sizzles.

Audrey apparently agreed to the picture for three reasons: it would bemade in Paris; Givenchy was to design her wardrobe; and Kurt Frings hadnegotiated her salary at $12,500 a week and an additional $\$ 5,000$ a week forexpenses—she was also given a car and driver for the entire time in Paris.

Paris—When It Sizzles began filming interior studio sequences and exteriorlocation scenes in July 1962, after a month of preproduction chores. Thestory concerns an American writer in Paris (Holden) who has been paid ahandsome sum to write a screenplay, but he has squandered his time in highliving and—two days short of the deadline—he has not come up with a singlepage of script. In desperation, he engages a typist (Audrey), and together theyinvent possible scenarios. From this premise, Axelrod developed sequencesin which the couple fantasize and even sometimes live their ideas, until theline between reality and imagination blurs. A predictably romantic endingensues, but even that is mocked at the fade-out.

A few days into production, Audrey learned that there was a burglary atVilla Bethania: her Oscar for Roman Holiday had been stolen, along with aPicasso painting and some jewelry. Only the statuette was recovered, in anearby forest. “The housebreakers must have decided that there just was notany place in the Swiss black market for it,” Audrey wrote to columnist HeddaHopper on July 27.

Except for the occasional chance meeting in Los Angeles, there had beenno contact between Audrey and Bill Holden over the nine years sinceSabrina. She did not want to resume a romance for which she had nonostalgia, but she thought they might at least have an enjoyable time workingtogether. In this, she miscalculated by a wide margin.

The film was far more enjoyable for some audiences than it was for thosein the production, which was plagued by Holden’s advanced alcoholism. “Iremember the day I arrived at Orly Airport for Paris—When It Sizzles,” herecalled. “I could hear my footsteps echoing against the walls of the transitcorridor, just like a condemned man walking the last mile. I realized that Ihad to face Audrey and I had to deal with my drinking. And I didn’t think Icould handle either situation.”

He was far more apprehensive over the prospect of working with Audrey,and his escape was to drink more heavily. “Bill had always drunk duringfilms,” according to his biographer, “but never as he did on Paris—When ItSizzles. He started drinking early and continued through the day.” Quine hadonce before directed Holden, and he was astonished. “Bill was like a punch-drunk fighter, walking on his heels, listing slightly, talking punchy. He didn’tknow he was drunk.” More than once the actor arrived at the studiocompletely unable to work, and Quine had to send everyone home.

Throughout the filming, Audrey was concerned and considerate, butsometimes Bill took her kindness for something more. When he wasdisappointed, he drank more heavily, which made Audrey more solicitous,which in turn made Bill more unrealistic in his expectations, which madeAudrey more sympathetic—and so it went, a roundel of missed cues thatbecame more awkward and poignant each day over the four months offilming. None of this is revealed in the performances.

The situation quickly reached critical mass, and Quine convinced Holdento enter an alcoholic clinic. The production was at a standstill, losing cashdaily, until Axelrod (in his capacity as coproducer) rang his friend TonyCurtis and asked him to rush to Paris and assume a guest role. Thus thecompany was kept busy while Curtis’s scenes were hurriedly written and

filmed; as it happens, they provide some of the movie’s most amusingmoments, for Curtis did a neat satire on a self-important, vainglorious andfrivolous young actor. (Marlene Dietrich and Mel Ferrer also had roles in thepicture: they are seen but not heard, and only for a few seconds.) After aweek, Holden returned from treatment temporarily sober and refreshed.

By that time, however, Audrey had had time to review the scenes filmedthus far, and she did not like what she saw. In five of her films—RomanHoliday, The Nun’s Story, The Unforgiven, Breakfast at Tiffany’s and TheChildren’s Hour—she had been photographed by the great Austriancinematographer Franz Planer, who brought his genius to more than 150motion pictures. Audrey had developed an almost fraternal rapport with“Frank” Planer, on whom she relied not merely for flattering lighting but alsofor a look that was right for each scene. But that autumn, Planer was ill withcancer (and died very soon after). With the influence that was hers by thetime of Paris—When It Sizzles, Audrey asked that Claude Renoir, thecameraman on the picture, be replaced. Her wish was a command, and overthe weekend, the man she recommended arrived—Charles Lang, who hadphotographed Audrey so rapturously in Sabrina.

Also by this time, Noël Coward had been cast in the role of the Hollywoodproducer who is Holden’s boss; Coward worked on the picture for three days.“Audrey, unquestionably the nicest and most talented girl in the business,deluged me with praise and roses,” Coward noted in his diary. “Bill Holden,off the bottle [as he was that week] and looking fifteen years younger,absolutely charming to work with…Audrey and Bill are enchanting. So isTony Curtis.” But Holden was very soon back on the bottle, and again he wasshuffled off for a week while the production worked around him, shootingAudrey’s close-ups.

During that week, the press reported that she had been elected to theFashion Hall of Fame for the third consecutive year, and she agreed to a longinterview. Her private wardrobe was very simple, she said—long straightshifts or plain pants with a jersey top. Her favorite earrings were simply smallpearls, and her makeup took only a minute to apply. “But my coloring lacksdefinition. I therefore prefer to wear black, white or muted colors such as

beige or soft pinks or greens. These colors tend to make my eyes and hairseem darker, whereas bright colors overpower me and wash me out.” Shewas quite tall and angular, she added, “therefore I don’t wear padded orsquared shoulders, and I often cheat on my armholes and collars to give anillusion of narrow rather than wide shoulders. I wear low-heeled shoes to givethe impression that I’m smaller than I am.”

AUDREY WAS THIRTY-THREE that year, and before production began, she at lastcompleted a long, gradual process of orthodontic work that had begun in1956. The crooked and pointed bicuspids she so hated had been replaced,along with several others that she thought unflattering; in addition, herincreasingly uncomfortable overbite had been corrected, and several teeth hadbeen capped. There had not been much call for her to smile broadly in apicture since Funny Face; now, at last, she was ready to do so as much aspossible, for directors, photographers and the public loved her ingenuous andbroad grin, which is much in evidence in Paris—When It Sizzles.

The finished film had a strange and unfortunate history. When it wasscreened at Paramount, few executives understood Axelrod’s satire onscriptwriting under pressure—or perhaps they comprehended it but did notmuch like it. Even fewer among them noted the dozens of references toAudrey’s earlier movies and to classics like Casablanca and High Noon.

Although the last third of the movie lost its initial pace and dynamic verve,it is very much a Hollywood insider’s joke book, and for those aware of thedifficulty of screenwriting, it should have been seen at once for what it was: aspoof of moguls and money-grabbing. Paris—When It Sizzles was also acomic treatment of the damply romantic imagination, with an acerbic take onthe foolishness of living as if one were in a movie. It was, in other words, farbetter and more intelligent than Paramount recognized. Modern audiencesoften think comedy should be unsubtle—direct and without much style orsubstance, merely a matter of quick laughs. This picture offered more; it wasalso in many ways the prototype for much in the later work of Mel Brooks.

But Holden’s troubles and the concomitant inconvenience caused to thedirector, the crew and the budget had poisoned the project so far as the studiowas concerned. With publicists in the dark before the film’s self-referentialclowning, unconventional structure and clever repartee, the decision wasmade to withhold it from release until the spring of 1964. Hence, critics knewwell in advance that even those responsible were fearful, and their noticeswere, perhaps inevitably, negative. Seen forty years later, the film is in someways superior to Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Whereas she often seemed detachedand discomfited by the shenanigans of that picture, here Audrey balancedfarce with satire: as a typist falling in love with her highly strung boss, shewas both girlish and savvy, and her comic pratfalls were executed withunflinching gusto. Despite the awkward conditions at work, she demonstratedthe infallible sign of a natural comedienne: she seemed to take everything andnothing seriously.

IN EARLY OCTOBER 1962, Audrey completed her scenes for Paris—When ItSizzles. Ordinarily, she would have rushed home, but although she missedSean, she remained in Paris when it cooled down and immediately beganwork on another picture. Audrey was now free of her obligations toParamount, and Stanley Donen (her director on Funny Face) offered her theleading role in an intricate romantic thriller with multiple identity-shifts and,as it turned out, a good deal of violence. The original screenplay was by PeterStone.

Charade, set in the French Alps and Paris, was a stylish, colorful,occasionally witty and utterly implausible story of Regina Lampert, who isplanning to divorce her wealthy husband and then learns that he has beenmurdered and has left no money. She meets Peter Joshua, a man of manyidentities and a multiplicity of names; as it turns out, he is interested in thehusband’s fortune. Also on the trail of the booty is a trio of unsavory thugs.As it turns out, the fortune was stolen by Lampert from a treasure thatbelonged to all the men during World War II. A suspicious Americanintelligence officer is also on the case. Everyone believes that Regina knows

the whereabouts of the fortune, but one by one the murderous hunters arekilled off—until the surprising, comic-romantic finale unites Regina and theman first known as Peter Joshua.*17

Audrey read the script during Holden’s first week-long absence in July andsignaled her interest—on two conditions: Cary Grant must be her co-star, andCharles Lang her lighting cameraman. Lang was available even in time forpreproduction, but Grant declined, citing another commitment; in addition, hewas more nervous than ever about their ages—he would turn fifty-nineduring production, and Audrey was thirty-three. Eventually, when the scripthe had been awaiting turned out to be dreadful, Grant agreed to do Charade,but he demanded certain changes that would make the relationship withAudrey more comic. Working with Holden and Quine, however sticky, hadpersuaded her that, introvert or not, she had a fair sense of comedic timingopposite the right leading man. More to the point, Stone’s polished dialoguefor Charade seemed actor-proof.

Despite the age difference, Cary Grant made the romance with Audreybelievable, as Humphrey Bogart, Henry Fonda, Fred Astaire and GaryCooper could not. Grant had, after all, been entirely convincing opposite EvaMarie Saint in Hitchcock’s North by Northwest, filmed when she was thirty-four and he fifty-four. But Grant, entering his sixtieth year, did not want toappear ridiculous opposite Audrey, so he insisted on some touch-ups to thedialogue that would indicate it was the eager woman who was pursuing him,not the reverse:

EGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

ETER: Yes, but we’re divorced.

EGGIE: That wasn’t a proposal—I was just curious.

ETER: Is your husband with you?

EGGIE: Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms—nowwe’re trying it with cities. What do people call you—Pete?

TER: Mr. Joshua…Well, I’ve enjoyed talking with you.

EGGIE: Now you’re angry.

TER: No, I’m not—I’ve got some packing to do. I’m also going back to Paristoday.

EGGIE: Oh. Well, wasn’t it Shakespeare who said, “When strangers do meet,they should erelong see one another again”?

ETER: Shakespeare never said that.

EGGIE: How do you know?

ETER: It’s terrible—you just made it up.

EGGIE: Well, the idea’s right, anyway. Are you going to call me?

ETER: Are you in the book?

EGGIE: Charles is.

ETER: Is there only one Charles Lampert?

EGGIE: Lord, I hope so.

Donen arranged a restaurant dinner to introduce the two co-stars to eachother. Audrey and the director arrived first, and when Cary joined them,Audrey stood up and said she was terribly nervous. “Don’t be nervous, forgoodness’s sake,” Grant said. “I’m thrilled to know you. Here, sit down. Putyour hands on the table, put your head down and take a few deep breaths.”

Audrey did just that—and promptly knocked over a bottle of red wine,which stained Grant’s cream-colored suit. Audrey was mortified, everyoneturned to stare and (thus Donen’s recollection) “Cary took off his coat andcomfortably sat through the whole meal just like that.”

“I felt terrible and kept apologizing,” Audrey said, “but Cary was so dearabout it. The next day he sent me a box of caviar with a little note telling menot to feel bad.” Donen decided to use the incident in the picture, and so inone sequence, along the banks of the Seine, Audrey’s character accidentallytosses a scoop of ice cream onto Grant’s shirt—and gets an identically suavereaction.

As the two stars began to work together in mid-October (just days after shecompleted the Quine film), there was a kind of benign, unstated competition.Always protective of his image and aware of both the value of good publicityand the danger of bad, Grant monitored Paris newspapers and magazines toconfirm that both his name and some flattering photos he had approved wereregularly seen. Similarly, Audrey supervised the pictures of herself that werereleased: she did not, for example, generally agree to the publication ofsnapshot images captured on the fly: from the great still photographers(Richard Avedon, Bob Willoughby, Bud Fraker and Dennis Stock, forexample) she had learned the value of meticulous studio lighting, carefulcosmetics and the most advantageous pose. (Walter Matthau, who had animportant role in Charade, acknowledged that Audrey taught him more aboutthe camera than any director.)

For advance publicity and promotion, every film production unit hasphotographers present to document the actors and crew at work and betweenshots—but the photos they take are thoroughly reviewed before distribution.Grant and Hepburn had good reasons for a certain vanity, but in those daysbefore there were omnipresent “handlers” to guard and guide actors, thisattention to detail was simply part of their professional alertness. Andwhatever tacit jealousy the Charade company sensed between the pair—alow-grade jockeying for primacy in the press—it was soon offset by mutualrespect and the sheer enjoyment of their collaboration.

Audrey saw that Grant was, in her words, “sensitive, reserved and quiet,”and he recognized the same qualities in her. “Working with him was a joy,”she added. “He was expressive and yet reserved. He led a very quiet life. I do,too. I think a lot of it has to do with shyness and wanting to be with peopleyou’re comfortable with, instead of having to always break new ground. Ithink because he was a vulnerable man, he recognized my vulnerability. Wehad that in common. He had more wisdom than I to help me with it. He saidsomething very important to me one day when I was probably twitching andnervous. We were sitting next to each other waiting for the next shot. And helaid his hand on my two hands and said, ‘You’ve got to learn to like yourselfa little more.’ I’ve often thought about that.”

Here was a woman idolized and loved by millions worldwide, and admiredfor her beauty, talent and demeanor. But that Audrey ought indeed to have“liked herself a little more” is not surprising. Perhaps the most distressingaspect of movie stardom—especially for women—is the fact that they arepitched into a kind of constant self-criticism, the result of knowing that one isalways being assessed by studios, directors, agents, colleagues, the press andthe public. Only the most arrogant actor is convinced that his appearance isperfect, his talent unassailable and his love of self enough to withstandcriticism in the present and anxiety about the future. Because Audrey was notarrogant but perhaps inordinately vulnerable, Grant was both correct andgently encouraging.

Like many seriocomic thrillers, Charade is perhaps remembered as betterthan it actually was—thanks to the smooth performances by Hepburn andGrant. Considered unnecessarily violent by many critics at the time (it wasreleased two weeks after the assassination of President Kennedy), it had allthe ingredients of a standard thriller: complicated plot shifts and changes ofidentity, an almost amusing but awfully sinister band of hooligans, unheroicwar heroes and a buried treasure that is, of course, out in plain sight. Thesewere mixed together in a story of wide and deep improbability with moreholes than a wheel of Jarlsberg cheese. But never mind (and audiences didnot): there were Hepburn, Grant and Paris, and they all looked terrific.

EARLY DURING THE filming of Charade, Audrey received far better news thanthat of her reelection to the Fashion Hall of Fame and her inclusion on theinternational lists of the best-dressed women. Since she had seen it on theNew York stage in 1956, she had hoped to assume the role of Eliza in amovie version of the musical My Fair Lady. This was not a vain ambition, forthe part was in many ways ideal for her—despite the fact that, in 1962, shewas thirty-three, too old by at least a decade: Julie Andrews, who created thepart in New York and then in London, had been twenty-one at the time of thepremiere; she was even then a singer of surpassing distinction.

The story, based on George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, was anothervariation of the Cinderella story. Set in London in 1912, it concerns thecoldly academic Professor Henry Higgins, who takes in a poor, bedraggledCockney flower girl, wagering that he can in short order correct her speechand manners and pass her off in high society as an elegant lady. In this hesucceeds so brilliantly that she is considered to be a princess. Shaw had basedhis play and the film of it on the ancient tale of Pygmalion and Galatea—hence his title.

Writer Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe, in My Fair Lady,made Eliza Doolittle a deeply sympathetic character that, as written, placesexceptional demands on a singing actress. The Cockney flower girl must becredibly coarse but likable; as an apprentice under Higgins’s stern tutelageshe must touch the audience’s sympathies and yet maintain a comic sense;and as the final idealized creation of Higgins’s fantasy (and the audience’s)she must convey the slight awkwardness of the “guttersnipe” transformedinto a lady of shimmering elegance. And all this has to be achieved while theactress delivers no fewer than seven songs.

Finally, on October 30, 1962, Kurt Frings concluded the protractednegotiations for Audrey to star; her leading man would be the originalHiggins of Broadway, Rex Harrison. Jack Warner had paid $\$ 5.5$ million forthe stage rights, and the movie was to have a budget of $\$ 17$ million, by far themost expensive Hollywood product to date. According to the terms of her

contract, Audrey was to receive $142,857.15, on the first of every July from1963 through 1969; when bonuses were included, she eventually received atotal of $\$ 1.1$ million (exceeding even Elizabeth Taylor’s million-dollarcontract for Cleopatra, then in production).

While Frings was in the last stages of talks with Warner, My Fair Lady hadclosed in New York, after six and a half years and 2,717 performances. JulieAndrews had played the role for three and a half years on Broadway and inthe West End, and her admirers were legion. After My Fair Lady, Lerner andLoewe had created another Broadway musical for her—Camelot. In 1962, sheturned twenty-seven, and it was widely assumed that she would inherit therole in the movie.

But studios depended on international distribution for payoff and profit,and that meant the casting of internationally recognized movie stars. Warnerwas nervous about engaging someone like Andrews, who was known in NewYork and London, but could not (he believed) be counted on to sell tickets inMunich or Madrid. The producer also felt he was taking enough of a risk withRex Harrison, who had been offered the part only when Cary Grant rejectedit.

And so Jack Warner heard all the arguments in favor of Julie Andrews,whom he could have obtained for a far lower fee than he had to pay KurtFrings. And then Warner confidently made his decision.

WHEN JACK WARNER signed Audrey Hepburn for My Fair Lady, a fewjournalists wondered why he had been willing to cast two major players fromthe theatrical version—Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway (the latter asEliza’s father)—and not Julie Andrews, the original leading lady. But historywas on Warner’s side: replacement of stage actors with more widely knownmovie stars had been the rule rather than the exception for decades, especiallyin musicals. At a press luncheon at the studio on June 4, 1963, Warnerintroduced his pricey cast along with director George Cukor and costumedesigner Cecil Beaton, who had been on the original Broadway team and hadfirst met Audrey in London in July 1953. Warner also fielded questions aboutthe forthcoming production and talked with high-toned meaninglessnessabout the state of “film art” in America, even while he disparaged “the so-called art films” coming from Europe. That day, everyone engaged to workon this historically expensive production was content. Warm, friendlyHollywood had never seemed warmer or friendlier.

The research for My Fair Lady and the design of its sets and costumeswere formidable enterprises. As much effort was expended, for example, onthe style and execution of Audrey’s shoes as on her outfits. “I pray every dayto be as good as the role,” she wrote in a note to Cukor that March, addingher request that the shoes be carefully measured, “because I have sufferedever since my ballet days.”

Exterior and interior scenes for the picture were to be filmed within theWarner soundstages in Burbank, and Cukor, Beaton and art director GeneAllen had already traveled to London that spring for preproduction,

scrutinizing everything from the dimensions of terrace houses and mansionsto period photos of professors’ home libraries; from the wall coverings to thefurniture and furnishings of the turn of the century; from the clothing and hatsworn by servants to the wardrobes of the middle- and upper-class denizens ofthe Ascot race. The buildings in Covent Garden—the Royal Opera House, theportico of St. Paul’s Church and the market—were to be carefully re-created,too, but in forced perspective.

Warner insisted that there be no appearance of the typical “indoor set” andnothing like a tourist’s London in his picture, and none was delivered. Inevery visual detail, My Fair Lady will forever remain one of the great artisticachievements in popular entertainment. The brilliance of it is precisely thevisual verisimilitude of every scene (with the possible exception of the longshots in the Ascot sequence). This was a resoundingly difficult thing toachieve and was ironically one of the reasons why musicals eventually fellout of favor with the American public.

In May, Audrey, Sean and the nanny arrived in Los Angeles, where ahouse had been rented for them. Audrey studied daily with singing coachHarper MacKay and diction teacher Peter Ladefoged, the former to help herwith the intricacies of the score, the latter to work with her on the accuraciesof both Cockney and Mayfair English. Mel occasionally dropped in and outof town while taking whatever roles he could land in movie comedies andhistorical melodramas.

“We keep hearing mild whisperings about their marriage,” wrote RenéeZinnemann to Kathryn Hulme and Marie Louise Habets, adding that she andFred were concerned about Audrey, for they “haven’t heard anything fromher.” That entire year, in fact, Audrey was for the most part out of contactwith her friends: not only was she preoccupied with her work on the film butshe was also, as Renée surmised, desperately unhappy in her marriage.

George Cukor, Alan Jay Lerner and Cecil Beaton welcomed her. “Sean,her two-year-old son, was present, and it is obvious that this is the love affairof her life, and she of her son’s.” Over tea and apricot jam roll at Audrey’sresidence, she suddenly asked, “Are you going to use my voice for songs at

all?” Well, her voice would be used for many of the songs, they said, “butcertain notes might be interpolated from another voice.” This set her mind atease, for she was anxious that her own singing in the picture not be replacedon the soundtrack by a professional vocalist: the mix of voices would bejarring for the audience, and if they had an opera singer, it would be untrue tothe role of Eliza.

In fact, Audrey’s contract gave the studio the right to substitute anothervoice, but from the day a voice teacher was assigned to work with her,Warner and Cukor had told her they had no doubt that in the end, she wouldrender the songs magnificently and her voice would be used (but for a fewminor interpolations). Besides, her singing would of course be prerecorded,and she would lip-synch to the playback on the set, and so all kinds ofcorrections could be made in the recording studio afterward. “I’ll work hardon my voice,” Audrey said that May afternoon, adding that she would “haveas many lessons as you like. It’s all part of the business, to learn to sing anddance.”

During costume fittings the following week, Beaton observed Audrey in amerry mood, “speaking in Eliza’s Cockney accent, joking with all the adoringhelpers.” Two weeks later, she sat before a mirror in the makeup department.With her thick flower-girl wig of hair and a weathered hat—but without theusual mascara and eyeliner—Audrey’s look was completely different fromher appearance in any previous film or still photo. It was as Beaton observed:simply by artfully painting her brows and lashes, she was a modern beauty—but without that makeup, she emerged as the real manifestation of a young,sad, destitute girl from another era. According to Beaton, “Audrey wasalready very touching and real” from the first day of rehearsals.

By the end of June, Beaton believed that Audrey’s concern about hersinging was misplaced: “Having worked on it like a Trojan ever since herarrival, her voice has improved to such an extent that she will be singing mostof Eliza’s songs.” So he had been told by George Cukor and by Jack Warnerhimself.

But this was an astonishing act of deliberate deception, and it would

miscarry in a way that seriously diminished the effect of Eliza’s character inthe picture and the artistic success of the film itself.

On May 16, Cukor and Lerner had met privately with singer Marni Nixon,who had dubbed the singing of Deborah Kerr (in The King and I and AnAffair to Remember) and of Natalie Wood (in West Side Story). After a briefaudition, Nixon was engaged to do the same for Audrey; she was also askedto keep the matter strictly private. On May 20, a production memorandummarked “confidential,” from Warner’s executive assistant Steve Trilling, wasdistributed to a number of the Fair Lady company: “We must have the doublevoice for Eliza ready by June 24—fully rehearsed and ready to go.” Audrey,who was still (thus Beaton) “engrossed in singing lessons,” was unaware ofthis development. On July 9, she met with Cukor, music director AndréPrevin, the orchestra and several executives for her first prerecording ofsongs for the film. “It was an ordeal for Audrey,” Beaton noted in his diary.

After weeks of rehearsals, of costume and wig fittings, of makeup, lightingand film stock tests, the first day of shooting was scheduled for August 12.“Everyone’s nerves are explosive,” said Audrey to a few of her colleagues.“It’s a difficult time for all of us.” To her father and his wife, she wrote ahasty note: “The heat is on, [and there is] any amount of things to finishbefore we start, but then if we rehearsed for another three years, we stillwouldn’t feel ready, so we may as well start. I think so often of you both.”

Beaton, among others, found her unruffled and “remarkably disciplined:her memory [is] never at fault, she appears on the set word perfect, and shecan give exactly the same performance over and over again,” despite therepeated takes that are customary in moviemaking.

Meanwhile, Marni Nixon was recording all Eliza’s songs. “The decisionhad already been made to have Marni dub her voice,” according to HarperMacKay, who was also Previn’s assistant. No one conveyed that news toAudrey, who continued to lip-synchronize to her own music tracks and thusto believe that, except for an occasional high note from Nixon’s recordings,her own voice would be heard in the picture. “Audrey dutifully worked onher vocalises for a half hour or so every morning, and the weeks went by,”

continued MacKay. To make matters worse, Cukor, Previn and Lernerlistened to Audrey’s singing and praised her lavishly, and (thus MacKay)“Audrey, unfortunately, began to believe them.” And when she completed thescene in which she performed “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly?” to a prerecordedtrack, the bit players and crew applauded loudly.

“Did you hear that?” Audrey asked Cukor excitedly at the end of the day.“They actually applauded!”

“Audrey,” Cukor said gently, “they thought it was you.”

Unknown to him, to Lerner and to Previn, the technician in charge ofplayback had indeed used her track instead of Nixon’s.

“George,” Audrey replied, tears filling her eyes, “it was me.”

But even for Audrey Hepburn’s sake, the corporate decision was not to berevoked, Marni Nixon dubbed all her songs as filming continued, and thefinal disposition was the reverse of what Audrey had hoped: in the end, it wasNixon’s singing, with but a few of Audrey’s musical phrases interpolatedhere and there—apparently so that Warner could say something aboutAudrey’s singing in the film and not be accused of outright mendacity. Thiswas cold comfort to her: she had worked on her singing as on her diction andperformance almost to exhaustion and under a deliberately false impression.When she learned the truth, she felt keenly let down, but after that day, shedisplayed no dejection or resentment—she simply proceeded with herassignment.

According to André Previn, Marni Nixon was hired because “AudreyHepburn could not do her own singing…[and] the leading lady had to trilllike a bird…since Rex Harrison was already firmly established as a master ofparlando, a kind of half-spoken singing.” But Previn—along with Cukor,Warner and the rest—had in fact supervised what was eventually a disastrousconsequence.

Marni Nixon’s singing, heard to this day in the picture, is brilliant,carefully prepared, finely realized and worthy of an accomplished recitalist—

it is, in other words, entirely inappropriate for the role. Nixon was right forthe songs in The King and I, in which Anna Leonowens (Deborah Kerr) is agenteel nineteenth-century British lady. Even Nixon’s dubbing for NatalieWood as Maria (a lovesick Puerto Rican girl in New York) in West SideStory was acceptable, since that picture combined dance and music drama ina way perhaps never intended to be realistic.

Two of Audrey’s recorded tracks have survived—her renditions of“Wouldn’t It Be Loverly?” and “Show Me”—and they banish all doubt as tohow the matter should have been settled: audiences should indeed have heardAudrey’s own singing voice.*18 To be sure, the songs would have been verydifferent from what Julie Andrews and Marni Nixon delivered—but thosesongs would have had an added measure of credibility. When Eliza, theforlorn Cockney, indulges her fantasy about what would be “loverly,” it isludicrous to hear Audrey’s touching middle-range voice, full of gentle pathosand youthful pluck, suddenly replaced by an operatic soprano.

Her singing in Funny Face and Breakfast at Tiffany’s was apposite for thecharacters and would have been in this case, too. In this regard, JackWarner’s reasoning had to be supported with specious arguments put forth bymusicians who forgot about larger issues and (we must surmise) a directorwho simply took the line of least resistance. Otherwise, the final judgment isimpossible to understand. Why would Jack Warner have engaged Audrey forMy Fair Lady if, from day one, he knew she could not sing and he wouldhave to mandate the dubbing of her voice throughout the picture? Why payan actress $\$ 1$ million for a musical if her singing—absolutely central to herperformance—will not be heard? And if he did believe, based on her previouspictures, that she could in fact sing, then why did he not make a picture thatwas also dramatically credible?

As it was released, the film provides a disagreeable jolt every time Eliza’sspeech segues to song. The disjunction, due to the obvious disparity in vocalstyles, does for My Fair Lady precisely what ought never to happen: it makesthe audience aware of the unreality of the sequences. At these junctures,Audrey Hepburn remains on the screen but Eliza vanishes from the picture.

Even a casual movie-watcher realizes that one voice blithely replacedanother that fateful autumn of 1963. For “Show Me,” Eliza is to be infuriatedwith men who talk instead of act. The song should have an edge, even a slightstridency to it—instead, the audience then and later heard a meticulouslyexecuted aria. Perched on a stool in the recording studio, the estimable MarniNixon did not have to be a singing actress, and her interpolations suggest thatthis was not among her considerations or the studio’s. Nixon’s singing is bothaccurate and, alas, vacant.

And so audiences view Audrey Hepburn’s nuanced and highly effectiveperformance rudely interrupted because of an obtuse misreading of popularexpectations. Previn’s argument to the contrary notwithstanding, Audrey’snatural voice would have been the perfect match for Rex Harrison’s stylizedcombination of speaking and vocalizing: the picture would, in other words,have sustained its keen realism in both characters.

After the resounding success of The Sound of Music in 1965, audiencesbecame impatient with the artifice of characters breaking into song (as ifanything in movies were real to begin with). As for any prospect of anAcademy Award for Audrey—who might indeed have won if her voice hadbeen heard—that possibility was sabotaged the day Marni Nixon was hired.The situation was quite logical: it would perhaps have been unimaginable forher colleagues to cite her for a role in a major musical in which she did notsing.

“You could tell, couldn’t you?” Audrey asked when a journalist brought upthe subject a year later and mentioned the unfortunate difference between herspeaking style and that of the singing. “There was Rex, recording all hissongs as he acted. Next time…”—but she left her remark uncompleted. Atthat moment, she might well have sung another song from My Fair Lady—“Just You Wait.”

THE PRESSURE OF working on a complex film and its concomitant frustrationwere aggravated by a fierce heat wave in Los Angeles that summer, even

more relentlessly over the San Fernando Valley, where Warner’s Burbankstudio was located. “We are only just surviving a truly ‘infernal’ heat wavethat has had us all gasping for air the last week,” Audrey wrote to her fatheron September 28.

At the studio [it has been] 110–118 [degrees Fahrenheit, or 43 to 48 Celsius]every day…without any cool off during the night. We pant through the nighton top of our beds only to find a yet hotter blast of desert air to greet us in themorning. Weekends are spent submerged in the pool and wet bathing suitsare our survival dress—but there is little I can do about Eliza’s heavy woolskirts and laced-up boots under the multi kilowatts of light. I just float awayunderneath.

She did not, however, report to her father the loss of her diamond weddingring, stolen from a bag in her studio dressing room.

In this climate, Audrey had to appear at the studio each morning at fiveo’clock, to be dirtied up for her scenes as a poor flower girl. For an hour,experts pushed dirt behind her fingernails and ears, smudged her face andgenerally turned her into the bedraggled Eliza; the process required an hour inthe morning and, for the reverse, again in the evening. The task was no easierfor later scenes, in which her makeup had to be modified for each camerasetup and for every costume and hairpiece. Audrey’s only dispensation withrealism was to spray L’Interdit liberally before the crew set to work on herappearance.

By November 19, she was on the verge of collapse and, under doctor’sorders, had to withdraw for three days. She returned on Friday, November 22.Work that day proceeded cheerfully until late morning, when someone with aportable radio ran to George Cukor as he discussed a scene with Audrey. Andthen everyone learned of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. “I

was too shaken to make the announcement or to tell the crew,” Cukorrecalled. “No one else could do it, either. And Audrey said simply, ‘I’ll doit.’” She took a microphone and said, “The President of the United States isdead. Shall we have two minutes of silence to pray or do whatever you thinkis appropriate?”

As everywhere else, many stood weeping; others were simply stunned. Afew moments later, Audrey said, “May God have mercy on us all.” Then theproduction continued until six that evening, for the schedule was five daysbehind, three of them due to Audrey’s indisposition. A year later, a journalistasked Audrey about that day. “It is a tradition in the theater in England and inAmerica,” she said, “for the leading lady or the leading man to make anyspecial announcements to the company. I just did what had to be done.”

Because the unseen participation of Marni Nixon was circulated in thepress during the last weeks of production, reviewers invariably noted the factwhen the film was released in the autumn of 1964. The London press wasgenerally dismissive of the first half of the movie, most of all because of whatwas considered her inadequate Cockney accent—as if there were only onestandard East End intonation by which those who assume it could be judged.No less an authority than John Gielgud was most enthusiastic: he went so faras to assert that Audrey was “much better than Julie Andrews.”

Many American journalists felt such loyalty to Julie Andrews that theywere unable to consider how distinctive a movie version of a role must be.But major critics were delighted. “Her wit is delivered with sure instinct,”wrote one New York journalist, “and her volcanic and hilarious wrath isalways smoldering.” The New York Times praised her most zealously: “MissHepburn brings a fine sensitivity of feeling and a phenomenal histrionic skill[to the role]…She is dazzlingly beautiful and comic in the crisply satiricAscot scene, stiffly serene and distant at the embassy ball, and almostunbearably poignant in the later scenes when she hungers for love.” Even TheNew Yorker joined the report supporting Audrey: “Her qualities as an actressand as a personality turn her Eliza into an utterly different, though no lesscaptivating, creature than that of Miss Andrews.”

In every sequence, Audrey’s performance is one of brightly naturalcalibration. As a flower girl, she is moving and funny in a way that ElizaDoolittle perhaps can never be on the stage, for the close-ups of her reactionsto the overbearing professor are a precise balance of waiflike poignancy andsudden ambition. Later, as the brand-new creature presentable at embassyreceptions, Audrey gave Eliza an almost imperceptible hint of gaucherie stillremaining beneath all her stylish grace—the flicker of an eyelid here, themerest change in her smile there—that kept alive the girl she was, rightalongside the woman she was becoming.

SHE MIGHT NOT have considered it in those terms, but Audrey had to deal withprecisely that sense of transition when she completed her work on My FairLady in December 1963: she knew her marriage was beyond repair, yet shewas not ready for divorce and was making valiant attempts to avoid theinevitable. “There was a lot of difficulty and some strain, because [Mel’s]career had peaked and she was at the top of hers,” said Sean later, speaking ofthis time in his parents’ lives. “In an almost unrealistic way, she hoped reallove would come in the form of flowers that are sent and not requested, andwhen that [hope] was disappointed, things started to come apart.”

The emotional distance between the Ferrers matched the geographic. Melhad traveled to Spain for his role in The Fall of the Roman Empire, and thenhe had dashed back to Hollywood during the production of My Fair Lady fora part in Sex and the Single Girl. Now he was preparing to write and direct aSpanish film called Cabriola and to produce and star abroad in the life of thepainter El Greco.

And so, despite the many offers she received in early 1964, Audreydecided to be a sort of married camp follower: clinging to the hope of savingher marriage, she and Sean (who turned four that summer) spent most of theyear traveling with Mel. “I split my time between Melchor and the boy,” shewrote to George Cukor, who tried without success to interest her in a musicalbased on the stage production of Oliver! “How glorious if Mel and I couldcontribute together and not be separated for once,” she replied as she declined

the offer. She did not add that she and Mel had indeed briefly consideredmaking a film together—the story of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain—butthey saw the unlikelihood of him directing her, and they soon abandoned theproject.

In their brief visits, Cukor, the Zinnemanns, Kate and Lou sensed Audrey’salmost desperate attempt to shore up the family as she endured a torridsummer while Mel completed his scenes in a Spanish film about the life ofthe French educator Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, founder of the ChristianBrothers. About that time, the Ferrers bought a summer house on the Costadel Sol, near Marbella—“Santa Catalina,” they named it, for AudreyKathleen (Catalina, in Spanish). They intended to take advantage of it as aholiday refuge, but the place was not much used.

In the autumn, Audrey had to fulfill her contractual obligation to travelacross America promoting the release of My Fair Lady, and so, without muchenthusiasm, she left Mel with his projects and Sean with the nanny. “I long toget home to our own cozy cottage and the peace of our mountains,” Audreywrote to “Dearest Daddy and Fidelma” that autumn. “I went to the states forthree weeks of MFL presentation. Mel was able to come to New York for thepremiere, but he had to return to Rome and work next day. I had to completethe tour alone and came home.” She mentioned the launch of the film onlyonce but wrote five pages about her “splendid” Sean and his new dog, anAlsatian.

In Hollywood, on February 23, 1965, the Academy of Motion Picture Artsand Sciences released the names of those nominated for Oscars. In addition toMy Fair Lady, some memorable movies had been released in 1964: Dr.Strangelove, Becket, Zorba the Greek and Mary Poppins among them. Thenominees for best actress of the year were Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins),Anne Bancroft (The Pumpkin Eater), Sophia Loren (Marriage Italian Style),Debbie Reynolds (The Unsinkable Molly Brown) and Kim Stanley (Séanceon a Wet Afternoon).

“As for the whole nomination mish-mash,” Audrey wrote to GeorgeCukor,

I think I am the only one who is not in the dark. Everybody seems to searchfor an explanation. It seems to me it is all very simple—my performance wasnot up to snuff. I firmly believe that were it true that anyone had it in for[Jack Warner] or me, or wished to ensure Julie Andrews’s Oscar, theirsentiments would have been automatically cancelled out had my bravurabeen worthy. Because My Fair Lady meant so terribly much to me, I had sortof secretly hoped for a nomination but never never counted on the Oscar.Therefore, disappointed I is, but not astounded like my chums seem to be.What does amaze me is the hullabaloo which ensued and the constantpressure…to get me to come to California on the big night.

Cukor replied to her letter, vainly protesting that she did not receive anomination because Warner did not release the picture on enough screens inLos Angeles prior to the nominations. Audrey knew better: My Fair Lady hadhad sufficient exposure that it received twelve nominations, and she was theonly player in the cast not nominated in one of the four top actingcategories.*19

On March 31, the British Film Academy named Audrey best Britishactress of the year for her performance in Charade. That was not muchremarked in Hollywood, however, where there was high tension for the ritesof spring. Oscar statuettes were handed out on April 5, and Audrey was there,having gallantly agreed to travel from Europe to present the award for bestactor—a task, in the circumstances, that might have been masterminded by asadistic functionary. With obvious pleasure, she announced Rex Harrison’sname; he then stepped up, embraced her and, to polite applause, saidchivalrously, “I have to thank two fair ladies, I think.” One of them was rightthere, and the other, as if on cue, then came up, as Julie Andrews received theaward for best actress for Mary Poppins. Her opening remark brought thehouse down, as the saying goes: “First of all, I’d like to thank JackWarner…”

FOR A DECADE, the Ferrers had lived in a German-speaking canton ofSwitzerland. By 1965, the family had outgrown the place, and Audrey wishedSean to attend a French-speaking school. They decided to purchase a two-hundred-year-old restored farmhouse near Morges, a half-hour from theGeneva airport. The eighteenth-century, nine-bedroom stone villa was calledLa Paisible—the peaceful place—and was situated in the village ofTolochenaz, part of the French-speaking canton of Vaud. Their neighborswere mostly orchard farmers, and the place was wonderfully quiet. At thesame time, Mel learned of a new play that was to open on Broadway thefollowing winter—Wait Until Dark, by Frederick Knott, the author of Dial Mfor Murder. Film rights were quickly negotiated for Audrey to star and Melto produce, at Warner Bros. in Burbank.

The picture she first made, that August, was her fifth to be filmed partiallyor completely in Paris; it was also her third picture for William Wyler, andhis first comedy since Roman Holiday. For How to Steal a Million, as it wastitled, Audrey’s leading man was three years her junior: Peter O’Toole,recently of Lawrence of Arabia and Becket. The screenplay by Harry Kurnitz,set and made entirely in Paris, was impossible to believe on any level, but thepicture was so engagingly made, and with such stylish deadpan humor andappealing (but not exaggerated) glamour, that it was a commercial andpopular hit.

Audrey was cast as the daughter of an art forger (Hugh Griffith) whomakes his fortune brilliantly copying the works of the masters and sellingthem as genuine. This felonious occupation is suddenly threatened when adetective masquerading as a burglar (Peter O’Toole) joins with Audrey in apreposterous scheme—to steal one of papa’s fakes, loaned to an art exhibit,so that he will not be revealed as a counterfeiter and be hauled off to prison.Romance is then added to comedy, with the predictable happy ending.

Kurt Frings had negotiated with Wyler and Twentieth Century–Fox toensure that Audrey would be supported by her now customary and loyalallies: Givenchy clothed her (in no less than two dozen outfits); Grazia De

Rossi styled her hair and Alberto De Rossi her makeup; and Charles Langwas the cinematographer—all of whom made it possible for Audrey to lookconsiderably younger than her thirty-six years. This team, and the amiable,relaxed working style of O’Toole, made for an agreeable summer’semployment, and Audrey’s performance in the film—nothing so demandingas My Fair Lady—was impressively unfussy, which was exactly what thescript required. Gregory Peck had been on the mark when he said that sheshould have done much more comedy during her career.

For Wyler and O’Toole, much of the pleasure of making How to Steal aMillion was their casual punctuation of the dialogue with improvised jokesthat reward the careful listener. At one point in their plot to steal a fakestatue, O’Toole dresses Audrey in the drab garb of a museum cleaningservant. That will do just fine, he says, looking at the unflattering outfit. Forwhat? Audrey wants to know—and O’Toole replies quietly, “Well, it givesGivenchy a night off.” Delivered as a throwaway remark of no specialsignificance, it was but one of several inside jokes relished by Audrey, thecast and the crew.

In September, Mel was laboring to secure the rights to the Knott play andto confirm a deal with Warner, and he visited Audrey in Paris for a weekend.She was not eager to plan a project to be undertaken two years in the future,but she wanted to support her husband’s efforts. And so she agreed to playthe difficult role of a blind woman terrorized by thugs who are hunting for astash of heroin that she does not know is in her home. Weeks after Mel’svisit, Audrey learned she was pregnant.

With two months left to work before How to Steal a Million wascompleted in December, Audrey was advised to ask Wyler for a slowerworking pace, but this she refused to do. “She had worked without letup,”according to Mel, who took her home to Switzerland after the last day’swork. There, the family celebrated their first Christmas at La Paisible, andAudrey decorated the house and wrote greetings to friends around the world.She sent a generous cash gift to her father, wrapped in a hand-drawn carddepicting holiday bells, ribbons and wreaths. “I have decided,” she wrote,“that you must know much better than I what you would best like for

Christmas, and also to avoid customs [taxes] I send my gift this way. Forgiveits prosaic appearance, but it is from a loving heart—and with a huge hug forboth of you.” Nor did she forget an equally lavish present to her mother, whohad been living for several years in San Francisco after emigrating fromLondon.

It was just after this holiday season that Audrey miscarried again. “Shetook it very, very hard,” said her husband.

# Chapter Fourteen

1966–1970

“SHE IS NOW beginning to feel much better,” Mel wrote to Audrey’s father inlate January 1966. “She is on her feet again, and although we are not lettingher do too much, her spirits and physical being are much improved. She isgoing to take four months’ rest here.”

Mel may have found her “much improved,” but Audrey did not feel so. Ina postcard to her father, she said she felt as if only “a thin layer” separatedher from a complete breakdown. “There is much to go through still, and Ipray God for strength and gentleness.” She closed the short message “All mylove, MP.” (In Audrey’s childhood, Ruston’s nickname for her was MonkeyPuzzle, a reference to what he thought was her odd face and her enigmaticpersonality.)

By late March, however, she was indeed stronger. “Having at last a realrest and sunny weather,” she wrote to her father from an Alpine resort. “Iwalk every morning and swim in the afternoon, also take massages and sleeplots…am well again and not so sad anymore. I start work on May 1 in St.Tropez, then Paris—a wonderful script.” It was indeed, but the circumstancesof making the movie would have serious consequences on Audrey’s personallife.

William Wyler had directed her in a trio of memorable performances, andnow it was Stanley Donen’s turn to complete his cycle of three Hepburnmovies. He had sent her a script he had prepared with writer FredericRaphael, whose screenplay for Darling had won the Academy Awards inBritain and America. Two for the Road, as it was called, would be a radical

departure for Audrey.

The style with which Audrey Hepburn had been associated, and which(with few exceptions) defined not only her look but also the public’sperception of her, was vanishing as rapidly from Hollywood as from ordinarylife. The chic clothes, the exquisite diction, the European flavor of her moviesand their literary tone, her choice of scripts and directors—all these werebeing rethought by Hollywood. The new kind of movie was represented by,among others, Cat Ballou, The Pawnbroker, Darling, Who’s Afraid ofVirginia Woolf?, Alfie, Georgy Girl, and Help! In 1966, Audrey turned thirty-seven, but popular taste was now dominated by the preferences of teenagers;the effect of the Beatles, and the upheaval in just about every area of youthculture, could not be minimized.

So it was that when Donen submitted the script for Two for the Road toUniversal Studios, they were eager to finance and distribute it—until hementioned that he wanted Audrey Hepburn as the leading lady; with that,Universal withdrew from the project. Twentieth Century–Fox, however, likedHow to Steal a Million and gave Donen a green light and the cash he needed.

The screenplay covered a twelve-year period in a marriage threatened byroutine, infidelity, remorse, mistaken cues, false hopes—and occasionallybuoyed by shared satisfactions, warm memories and indelible moments oflove, support and empathetic understanding. The story was not told in strictchronology, but rather by bending backward and forward in time,interlocking episodes as they are evoked by one or another event orrecollection—all of it supporting the notion that relationships do indeedproceed along an uncertain road with unforeseen curves and turns. The roaditself was in fact a character in the script, present in every sequence.

When she read the script, Audrey was wary of the content and protectiveof her image. The seriocomic dialogue was acerbic, often cynical, and thecharacter of Joanna, the wife who changes and matures—not alwaysadmirably—was not at all prettified from Raphael’s primary idea (as, earlier,Holly Golightly had been transformed from Capote’s rougher original).Indeed, Joanna was nothing like a Hepburn character at all: she bore no

similarity to any woman Audrey had impersonated, and so the actress fearedlosing both her image and her public. Joanna did, however, resemble someaspects of Audrey herself, and the recognition of this frightened her. Perhapsthe most unsettling element for her was not the character’s infidelity, or eventhe frank bedroom scenes, but rather the disturbing parallels of the couple toher own marriage, then in its twelfth year. No, she told Mel, she was not at allsure this project was right for her—which was her way of turning it down.

To his credit, Mel would not let the subject drop. He understood that, if hercareer was not to be a casualty of the new age in entertainment styles, Audreyhad to rise to the moment. The princess of Roman Holiday, the child-womanof Sabrina and Love in the Afternoon, the romanticized party girl of Breakfastat Tiffany’s and the clever lady of Charade—these characters were becomingcommercially past tense. “Audrey usually makes up her own mind aboutwhat she’s going to do,” Mel said at the time. “But when I read the script ofTwo for the Road, I told her to make it—right away. I knew it would be goodfor her.” Human motives are rarely undiluted, and Mel may have thought thatif he was going to produce Wait Until Dark, which was very much acontemporary thriller, it would be prudent for Audrey to be seen in advanceas still pertinent for a new audience.

There were arguments from the start, and in fact the deal was declareddead more than once. First, Donen was adamant that Givenchy was not to bepart of the creative team. But his clothes gave her confidence, Audreyprotested. The director was intransigent: her clothes were to be taken off therack. She left the task to Mel and Stanley, but she was not happy. “Shethought the bright colors and modish prints would take away from her face,”recalled Ken Scott, part of the costume design team that included HardyAmies, Mary Quant and Paco Rabanne, all of whose fabrics and patternswere chosen for their contemporary look.

Then there were heated discussions about Audrey’s leading man. Now thatshe had the authority, she would no longer accept a replica of Holden,Bogart, Fonda, Cooper, Lancaster or even Grant. She might, she added, justas well have a co-star who was of the day, like Peter O’Toole. Names roseand fell, some were contacted, Paul Newman read the script and declined—

and then someone suggested Albert Finney, six years younger than Audreyand a classically trained actor who had just had an international success in theuproarious Tom Jones.

Filming began in the South of France on May 3, the eve of Audrey’s thirty-seventh birthday. Explaining to George Cukor why she had been out of touchfor so long, Audrey wrote from St. Tropez:

I have drawn a complete blank in the whole period of Christmas and the twomonths that followed. I find even now hard to remember what I did and didnot do, who and when and what I saw—perhaps [this is] nature’s sometimesso charitable way of helping one to forget—in my case not so much theanguish but the joy I had felt.

Sean is now in school and God knows how I miss him…Albert Finney is amarvel, so easy and “cooperative,” as they call it, that he makes even melook “uncooperative”!!

Our new house is a dream. As I left, the fruit trees were in bloom, the freshspring grass stood high below them, filled with buttercups and clover. All thetulips were out and the glycinia [was] blooming away on our walls.

“My private life was not always happy,” Audrey said, recalling theproduction of Two for the Road. “But with Stanley, I was always happy onthe set. He made me laugh, and that, for me, was an enormous turn-on.” Shecertainly had a friendly rapport with Donen, for whom she had respect andfrom whom she always claimed to have learned a great deal. He felt thatAudrey was always reserved, even to the point of being aloof:

I longed to get closer, to get behind whatever was the invisible, butdecidedly present barrier between her and the rest of us, but I never gotto the deepest part of Audrey. I don’t mean to imply that I thought she

was playing a game with me. But she always kept a little of herself inreserve, which was hers alone, and I couldn’t ever find out what it was,let alone share it with her. She was the pot of gold at the end of therainbow.

Jacqueline Bisset, also in the cast, recalled Audrey’s extraordinarypreparation for each scene, and the constant presence of her hair and makeupteam, on whom Donen depended to clarify the chronology of each sequence.“Audrey was very pleasant to everyone on the production,” according toBisset,

but there was a kind of distance there. When we first met, she gave me avery broad smile I’ll never forget. It wasn’t a smile with the eyes, butwith her mouth only. Of course, she was the star of the film and hadenormous responsibilities. And she could be very generous with us. Afew times, on the weekends, she cooked dinner for several of us—veryrich pastas, with all sorts of wonderful cream sauces. But when weworked during the week, she went to her trailer and had lunch on herown—a bit of cheese with some tomato, or something like that—a verytiny meal, so that she could work at top form through the afternoon.

But there was a good reason why Audrey kept her distance from the otherplayers and from her director—a greater distance during Two for the Roadthan perhaps at any other time in her career. For the four months of filming,she and Albert Finney pursued a frolicsome romance in the most discreetmanner possible. They rehearsed in private, they went to beaches with noother company, they dined à deux. Her marriage, she had to accept, wasmerely legal, and Finney was divorced. More to the point, he had a keensense of humor, he was highly intelligent, he took his craft with utmostgravity, and he had a personality that was enormously beneficial to Audrey atthis point: he was entertaining and exuberant. The relationship wasrefreshingly uncomplicated and so perhaps unique in her romantic life.

“I didn’t even know the Audrey of the last few weeks on this film,”recalled Donen. “She overwhelmed me. She was so free, so happy. I neversaw her like that—so young! I don’t think I was responsible. I guess it was

# Albie.”

“She and Albie had this wonderful thing together,” recalled writer IrwinShaw, a frequent visitor to the production that summer, “like a pair of kidswith a perfect understanding and a shorthand of jokes and references thatclosed out everyone else. When Mel was there, it was funny: Audrey andAlbie got rather formal and a little awkward, as if now they had to behavelike grown-ups.” As for Finney, he was discreet then and later: hisrelationship with Audrey, he said, was “one of the closest I’ve ever had.”Audrey was typically equivocal. “I really love Albie,” she said with a smile,and that was that. Meantime, columnists around the world reported thefriendship that was blossoming between the two stars—with the usualinnuendoes neatly appended.

Six-year-old Sean, meanwhile, was in the South of Spain with his father.“Mel splits his time between him, me and his work,” Audrey wrote to herfather on August 11. But as the production drew to a close early the followingmonth, there was a development Audrey may not have foreseen. How Audreyand Albie parted may never be known, but in September, everyone aroundher noted a fearful expression and a nervous anxiety that even Finney wasunable to alleviate. According to some who knew them both, Mel informedhis wife that unless she ended the affair, he would bring suit for divorce andspecify her adultery as the reason. This struck terror into her, for that wouldmean at least part-time separation from her son—if not the complete loss ofhim when she was proclaimed in court as an unfit mother. Sean, after all, wasthe single compelling reason for her to remain so long in an emotionallysterile marriage.

Even if Mel did not communicate his intention directly to her, Audreycould not be certain that he would, from afar, play the role of a complaisanthusband regarding an affair that was noised about even in the press. If indeedhe were to accuse his wife of infidelity—and there was no guarantee hewould not—then Audrey could not anticipate a favorable judgment on herrequest to keep her son. Whatever might have been an analogous situation inMel’s private life, it was unreported by the press, and that made thedifference. She was potentially the one to lose, and catastrophically.

“I remember there was a tension in my parents’ marriage at that time,”Sean said long after. “Only years later did I realize it was because she washaving an affair with Finney during the making of that movie.” The Finney-Hepburn romance ended precisely to save the child from a publichumiliation; he could not, however, be saved from the experience of hisparents’ separation.

In a way, this chain of anxieties brought a depth of complex feelings toAudrey’s performance in the movie, in which she progresses from a pensiveyoung lady to a frisky young companion, then a happy wife, later a doubtfulspouse and mother, then an adulteress and finally a woman who comes toterms with the ambiguities of her marriage. The audience can always markthe periods of transition, however disjointed in the narrative, by her differentclothes and hairstyles, but Audrey also conveyed the evolution throughexpressions and voice modulations.

“The role required a depth of emotion, care, yearning and maturity thatAudrey had never played before,” according to Stanley Donen. “She gavewhat I think is her best performance.” Critics worldwide agreed, but, as shehad anticipated, the American public was resentful of the shift in Audrey’simage. When the picture was first released in 1967 in America, at Radio CityMusic Hall, the theater did not sell enough tickets to cover even a minorportion of its usual lavish, live entertainment. Box-office receipts abroadwere far healthier, perhaps because European audiences were accustomed tofranker depictions of marriage in the movies.

AFTER CHRISTMAS AT Tolochenaz, the Ferrers traveled to Los Angeles, where,as planned, Mel was to produce and Audrey would star in Wait Until Dark atWarner Bros. studios. “We are both here,” she wrote to her father from theirsuite at the Beverly Hills Hotel. “Sean we left (sob, sob) at home, as he hatedto leave his new school and all his friends. [It was] the best decision for himalthough hard on us…I long to go home and stay there!”

Jack Warner introduced Mel and Audrey to the production company, to the

crew and to her fellow actors (Richard Crenna, Alan Arkin, Jack Weston andEfrem Zimbalist, Jr.). The great pleasure for Audrey that January afternoon,however, was her reunion with the director—none other than Terence Young.He had been among the war-wounded at the Battle of Arnhem, a thirty-year-old British paratrooper nursed back to health by Audrey and her mother at aDutch clinic in 1945. After his recovery, he had made a film about that battleand had then begun a successful career in commercial films. Young had infact just directed the first two James Bond films, Dr. No and From Russiawith Love, and he now had a deal with Warner. Every day during filming,Young and Audrey called an English-style tea break for the production team,promptly at four o’clock.

Preparing the difficult role of Susy Hendrix, the terrorized blind woman,Audrey immediately began painstaking research. She studied at a school forthe blind, learned Braille, forced herself to stare widely at someone with ablank gaze that gave the impression she saw nothing, taught herself tonegotiate around a room with a stick (her eyes shielded by a blindfold) andbecame adroit at dialing a telephone and applying makeup without a mirror.For even greater realism, Mel wanted his wife to wear milky, light-coloredcontact lenses. This she attempted, but they were extremely irritating to hereyes, and she did not believe they were necessary. In his capacity asproducer, Mel then summoned Jack Warner and a few colleagues, and theypronounced their agreement; dutifully, Audrey wore the lenses.

In every way, the filming was exceedingly difficult, from the start date onJanuary 16 to the conclusion on April 7. First of all, Audrey missed Sean tothe point that she accumulated thousands of dollars in transatlantic telephonebills, calling every night from the Beverly Hills Hotel to Tolochenaz. Second,her collaboration with Mel was much constrained by his status as producer,for he tended to act more like her agent, manager and director. Third, Audreyhad to endure almost constant bumps and bruises, especially those causedduring the violent scene in which she is attacked. The climactic sequence, forexample, had to be filmed mostly in very low lighting (it was a nighttimescene, enacted—for plot reasons—without lightbulbs), and it involvedcarefully orchestrated moves and leaps by Audrey and Alan Arkin, as thearch-villain; he recalled that the only thing he hated about Wait Until Dark

was his obligation to terrorize Audrey Hepburn.

Despite the complicated emotional and physical circumstances, Wait UntilDark was a hugely effective picture. The characteristic critical reaction wasthat her performance was “superior…beautifully modulated without everturning shrill.” For it, Audrey received a salary of $\$ 900,000$ plus ten percentof the gross proceeds, which brought her eventual profit to more than $\$ 3$million; she also earned a fifth Academy Award nomination.*20

Within days of completing her work, she returned to Tolochenaz and Sean.Mel remained at the Burbank Studios to supervise the editing of the picture,and in July he proceeded to Paris and Madrid to discuss future projects. “Itwill be a long time before I make another film,” Audrey said. “I promised myson at least two thousand hours of my time.” From this time, she visitedAmerica only rarely over the next two decades. She did, however, return toNew York as early as April 1968, to receive a special Tony Award (perhapsinexplicably) for contributions to the theater. Speaking of her American stagedebut in 1951, she said that she had been “a rather thin girl with a rather thintalent.”

Otherwise, she kept her word on both counts. “I really quit when my sonSean became of age to go to school,” she added later. “I had always wantedchildren so badly that I was miserable when I went off and did [Wait UntilDark]…I could not bear to be separated from him, so I stopped working.”

That was certainly her primary reason for what was eventually an eight-year retreat from her career. But she also coolly assessed recent developmentsin popular entertainment and saw how ill suited she was for most of it by bothtemperament and image. Audiences in 1968 were buying tickets to see newkinds of pictures—among them, Bonnie and Clyde, In the Heat of the Night,The Graduate, Cool Hand Luke, The Dirty Dozen, In Cold Blood and TheValley of the Dolls. Neither the sexual frankness nor the violence, neither thetone nor the design of the new Hollywood much appealed to her. At the sametime, there were very few roles for someone of Audrey’s type and age: shewas too fixed in the public mind, even after Two for the Road, to undertakesomething like Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate (which she was not offered in

any case), and she very likely could not have projected the voracious andpathetic hunger of characters like that.*21

Grace Kelly, born the same year as Audrey, withdrew from screen actingin 1956, when she was twenty-six. She, too, had appeared twice on Broadwayand, like Audrey, had received an award for her stage work. Like Audrey, shethen went to Hollywood, where she appeared in only eleven films during herfive years there, and won a best actress Oscar the year after Audrey. Just so,Grace worked with several first-rate directors; the best were Alfred Hitchcock(three times), Fred Zinnemann and John Ford. Like Audrey, Grace actedopposite leading men who were old enough to be her father (Clark Gable,Gary Cooper, Ray Mil-land, James Stewart, Cary Grant and—twice—BingCrosby) and with men who simply looked considerably older (StewartGranger, William Holden and Alec Guinness).

Grace was also like Audrey in her earnest desire to be a good actress, inher classic elegance, her photogenic beauty and the admiration and affectionshe earned from colleagues. And Grace made a decision in 1956, at the age oftwenty-six: wanting to be a wife and mother, she exchanged what she knewto be the ephemeral life of a movie queen for the lifetime role of Princess ofMonaco. Audrey spoke of her to friends several times after Wait Until Dark.

And so in 1967, Audrey Hepburn, international movie star, undertook therole of Audrey Hepburn, full-time mother. “She liked things plain andsimple,” according to Sean, who recalled that his mother loved to tend theroses, hydrangeas and dahlias in her garden, that she shared the kitchenchores with their cook, and that she supervised her son’s schoolwork. Neveran unduly severe parent, she nevertheless permitted Sean only a half-hour oftelevision-watching daily and, to encourage good eating habits, only oneCoca-Cola a week. As for her own menus, she maintained a healthy vigilanceover her diet but was not obsessive about her weight or lack of it. She atepasta and steak, allowed herself a piece of chocolate every afternoon, drank ascotch or bourbon before dinner—but, unfortunately, she was also a heavysmoker.

DURING THE SUMMER of 1967, Audrey and Mel separated at last, and she filedfor divorce; that season, he left La Paisible. “The breakup between mymother and my father was hard,” Sean recalled. “My parents never argued infront of me, but I was aware from quite a young age that something justwasn’t right. She came and told me that she and Dad were going to divorce,but explained that none of it was my fault—children often believe they are insome way to blame. When she told me, I was very upset, naturally, because Iloved them both, but I was also relieved in a way, because it explained whythings didn’t feel quite right at home.”

“I still don’t know what the difficulties were,” said Mel, perhaps somewhatdisingenuously, years later. “Audrey’s the one who asked for the divorce.”That year, he was photographed at this or that Hollywood spot with this orthat attractive woman, some famous and some not.

Addressing the charge that he had been Svengali to her Trilby, Melinsisted: “I had a great deal to do with her career, and I’m delighted I wasable to contribute.” So much was true until he added: “But I didn’t benefitfrom it, I was not competitive, nor was I controlling…I don’t think anybodycould compete with Audrey. I don’t think there was any sense in trying to.”

Very soon, Audrey was quoted in the European press, speaking of hermarriage as if it had been an illness: “I am completely recovered—now I amfree and at peace.” But this sounded very much like whistling in the dark.

“She never spoke badly of Monsieur Ferrer,” Givenchy recalled, “evenwhen things went badly with them and she was making enormousconcessions for the sake of their marriage.” At home, too, she did not openlydisparage Mel to Sean, but the boy had the impression “and the underlyingfeeling [from her] that he was the only responsible party. On the surface, itappeared that way, because he was more difficult…He wasn’t an easy man,by any stretch of the imagination. He was extremely talented, well read,educated, [and] certainly played a very important role in the choices that shemade and the standards that she kept…But she stayed too long in the

marriage, and it had a toxic effect [on her]—she kept reacting over and over[to the failure of] the marriage.”

Audrey indeed felt that Mel was accountable, but simultaneously she feltthat she was to blame. The paradox is easy to untangle, as Sean did: “Theywere both responsible for the failed marriage,” he claimed, “she forprojecting [onto it] something that wasn’t, and he for not being able to getover himself at some level.”

Sean was right. For years, Audrey had worked so hard to present an imageof the perfect marriage that she began to believe it was. From the start, therehad been a disparity in their goals and ambitions, and the gulf widened afterthe birth of Sean. “Success isn’t so important for a woman,” she said, “andwith the baby I felt that I had everything a wife could wish for. But it’s notenough for a man. It was not enough for Mel. He couldn’t live with himself,just being Audrey Hepburn’s husband.” For far too long, the Ferrers did notwant to remain together, yet in some ways, they wanted precisely that.

After Ondine, Mel had wanted them to collaborate more and more, onstage, screen and television, and he saw himself as her mentor and guide toachieving that. For a time, when they worked together on War and Peace andMayerling, it seemed possible. On her side, Audrey certainly wanted to work,but at a more leisurely pace so that she could be a mother; multiplemiscarriages did not deter her from that intention. Nor, indeed, did thegradual unraveling of their commitment to each other: parenthood, she mayhave thought, would unite them more deeply.

Even up to 1965, Audrey was still willing to have Mel as the father ofanother child. By this time, as her son Sean later observed, she had projectedsomething onto the marriage that did not exist—even while Mel could not“get over” the fact that he was never going to achieve his ambition to be aninternationally acknowledged actor, producer and director. Eventually, for theremainder of his career, he was offered only mediocre roles in forgettablefilms and television episodes—enough for him to provide a comfortable lifefor himself and his fifth wife (whom he married in 1971), but not, perhaps,sufficient to gratify his earlier dreams of what might have been.

BY THE BEGINNING of 1968, Audrey was firmly established as the chatelaineof La Paisible—a single mother, supervising house, garden and son, but thefreedom and peace of which she had spoken so warmly soon began to seemillusory and purposeless. For almost fourteen years, she had been able to relyon someone to look after things—to run interference with directors, agents,managers, publicists, the press; someone with whom she could discuss things,and on whose intelligence she relied to advise her. Hence, despite the factthat there were incidents of Mel’s intervention that were embarrassing ordownright infuriating, Audrey was now, at thirty-nine, completely on herown, and lonely.

She may have thought of herself as simply a mother, maintaining a homeand devoting herself to her son, but she was still Audrey Hepburn, the Oscar-winning actress, a worldwide celebrity and international fashion plate—virtually unacknowledged royalty. It had been comforting to talk of full-timemotherhood and to anticipate withdrawal from the demands of moviemaking,but suddenly she was alone, caring for an eight-year-old son who could notsupply what had enriched her in a gratifying public life.

Nor were there friends with whom to collaborate on projects: no Wyler orWilder, no Donen or Zinnemann, no Alberto and Grazia De Rossi or CharlesLang. Everything about her public life, to which she was long accustomed,suddenly came to a halt. She was the private person she said she wanted to be—but now she began to realize that she did not want to be just a privateperson. Two maids, a cook and a gardener-chauffeur certainly lightened herchores, but these helpers were hardly to be regarded as proper companions inwhom she could confide. She smoked more than ever, and her weight againdropped to eighty pounds, far too little for her five-foot-seven frame. Shewas, as Givenchy said, “miserable”; in fact, she was again close to a full-scale collapse.

Audrey and Sean frequently traveled to Italy on weekends and schoolholidays: she had maintained friendships in and around Rome since the timeof her work there, and so they could be part of a family rather than hotel

clients—with, most notably, the Lovatellis, who, long contrary to Italian lawand custom, relished using their aristocratic titles. La Contessa Lovatelli,sister of one of Henry Fonda’s former wives, took it on herself to introduceher famous guest at lavish dinners, sporting events and beach outings.

That season, a curious period of la dolce vita began in the life of AudreyHepburn. There was, after all, no serious occupation in her life, and whateverthe joys of motherhood, they could not entirely compensate for the radicaldifference in her days. She craved the company of grown-ups, and by defaultshe accepted facsimiles thereof.

Indeed, La Contessa was rather like the Italian Dolly Levi, arrangingromantic appuntamenti for her friend from spring to early autumn 1968.During those months, Audrey was seen in the company of, for example, thedashing matador Antonio Ordoñez. He claimed that classical dance was thecontrolling metaphor for his promenade in the ring, and he had enjoyed thefriendship of Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles. Ordoñez had aknowledge of ballet and film that enabled him to speak with Audrey aboutmuch more than corridas, and for a brief time, La Contessa thought she hadsucceeded on the first throw. But for some reason, that liaison ended. Next,Audrey briefly dated Prince Alfonso de Bourbon, seven years her junior, achampion sportsman and ski fanatic. That, too, was a short-lived business.Presently, she was photographed leaving a restaurant and then a concert hallwith Prince Marino Torlonia, who traced his lineage back to a wayward pope,and whose family still advised the Vatican on financial matters. Il principewas strike three.

Audrey returned to Switzerland in the autumn of 1968 for her final divorcedecree. “My parents didn’t talk for twenty-five years,” said Sean. “Well, theydid once, at my graduation, and then fifteen years later, at my first wedding.”Audrey remained on good terms with several of her ex-husband’s relatives.“She maintained a warm and sturdy bond with my mother,” said Joe Ferrer,Mel’s nephew. The legal details of the divorce thus settled, Audrey hastenedback to Rome—not because the Countess had found another candidate, butbecause Audrey had already met a man who very much attracted her.

Andrea Dotti was not a prince, but he was nominally a count. Son of theCount and Countess Domenico Dotti, he was born in Naples, where titles areeven more plentiful than pizzas. Andrea had taken a medical degree and hadthen built a respectable career as a practicing psychiatrist and faculty memberat the University of Rome.

Five foot nine and boyishly handsome, with light brown hair and gentle,dark brown eyes, he turned thirty in 1968 and was therefore almost a decadeyounger than Audrey. They had met as guests aboard the yacht of a mutualfriend, a twenty-four-year-old princess with the operatic name of OlimpiaTorlonia dei Principi de Civitella-Cesi. She was married to a wealthy Frenchoil magnate and was none other than the sister of the investment bankerpolitely turned away by Audrey. During an indolent cruise to Greece, Andreahad swiftly charmed Audrey out of depression; indeed, the so-calleddepressive personality in women was his clinical specialty.

That encounter took place on the principessa’s schooner in June, andshortly thereafter, Audrey rang Givenchy. “I’m in love and happy again,” sheconfided. “I never believed it would happen to me. I had almost given up.”She saw her designer in Paris that autumn. “After she met Monsieur Dotti,”he recalled, “she began to perk up—oh, not full-cheeked, of course, that’s notAudrey. But [she was] happy, and her body began to show it.”

When did the relationship become serious? “Somewhere between Ephesusand Athens,” Andrea said—on Olimpia’s love boat. “It was not, however,that the Signora Hepburn came to cry on my shoulder about the breakup ofher marriage, or that I gave her comfort as a psychiatrist. It was none of this.We were playmates [!] on a cruise ship with other friends, and slowly, day byday, our relationship grew into what it is.”

What it was, was a whirlwind courtship. They met several times in Rome,and once or twice Andrea came to La Paisible to meet Sean, but the lovers’customary weekend hideaway was a friend’s cottage on the island of Giglio.On Christmas Eve, Andrea presented Audrey with a solitaire diamond ringfrom Bulgari. She accepted his proposal on the spot.

To Audrey’s closest friends, everything happened with alarming rapidity—especially when the couple wed, on January 5, 1969, just six weeks after shesigned her final divorce decree. Givenchy designed a short-skirted pink jerseydress for her, with a cowl collar and a matching foulard tied under her chin.“I have married a man whose culture is unlimited and whose conversation isendlessly fascinating,” said the bride after the ceremony, held in the town hallof Morges, near La Paisible.

It was the first marriage for Andrea, who had enjoyed a busybachelorhood, often escorting wealthy, titled or merely good-looking women.Officially, Audrey was now La Contessa Dotti, but using that title was nomore a consideration than her title of baroness.

Andrea’s mother was just fourteen years older than Audrey. She helpedtrain the bride in the fine points of Italian cooking and introduced her to thelarge Dotti family. “Andrea,” said his mother ominously, “has two distinctpersonalities. He’s very serious and very social. I used to call him Dr. Jekyll,because he shut himself off for hours to study. Then, when his work wasdone, he was very witty and social and dying to go out. I always encouragedmy boys to have a good time when young. If you start life too late, it’sawkward, and you never have good manners.” This was not merely theamusing, somewhat paralogical repartee of an upto-date Italian mamma—itwas also something of a cautionary comment, for Andrea was longaccustomed to “having a good time.”

“OF COURSE WE will all live together,” the doctor told a journalist that winter.“I will try to be a good companion to Sean. I will play with him. I will teachhim things he doesn’t know and above all I will love him. We will be a happyfamily.”

At first, Andrea’s mother offered two floors of her own house, a cozypalazzo. Wisely and with thanks, Audrey and Andrea declined, and soon theyfound a penthouse with a wide view over Rome. Audrey delivered Sean tothe Lycée Chateaubriand in the mornings and met him in the afternoons, andfor a time the three lived together in what seemed an easy rapport.

But to Audrey’s astonishment, Andrea began to grant an occasional pressinterview, and he did not discourage the ubiquitous paparazzi who werenever far from their door and even popped up outside Sean’s school. Audreyloathed those moments, but Andrea thought it was all very amusing andglamorous. Alas, he went further: of course his wife would return to films, hetold journalists: “She is a great actress, and it would be criminal to depriveher of something she loves.” Indeed, Dotti had captured a star for a wife, andhe expected that she would continue to be his trophy as one of the world’smost alluring celebrities.

She was in training to be an Italian housewife and, she hoped, eventually amother to Andrea’s son. “I worked nonstop from when I was twelve until Iwas thirty-eight,” she said. “I feel a need to relax, sleep in the morning, takecare of my child. Why should I resume the work and life I rejected?”

Why, indeed—especially when she learned of her pregnancy in June ofthat year?

Audrey kept the house in Tolochenaz, which was hers according to thedivorce terms, and where she and Sean spent many weekends and schoolholidays in retreat from the constant pursuit of photographers. At first,Andrea regularly accompanied them to Switzerland, but professionalobligations required him to remain in Rome, even on weekends. To avoid yetanother mishap, Audrey spent the last ten weeks confined mostly to bed at LaPaisible. In Lausanne, on February 8, 1970, she underwent a cesareanoperation and gave birth to a boy she and Andrea named Luca, after hisyounger brother.

The Dottis were, for the present, the picture of a happy couple with theirtwo children, and Audrey said she would be glad to have more. But herdoctors, considering her age and history, advised against that. Said Andrea:“You shouldn’t tempt the devil.”

But it wasn’t Audrey who was assailed by temptation. While she spent aquiet life with her boys at La Paisible and waited for her husband’s weekendor monthly visit, he continued to work in Rome by day and to frolic by night,

often in the company of glamorous women. These were colleagues, heprotested—or former patients, or advanced students. In any case, Audreythought it better to return to Rome in May with the two boys and to devoteherself to family life. This seemed, for a time, to temper her husband’sschedule. Exhausted after the cesarean delivery and the Swiss winter, she wasglad to have their household staff. And with no financial or psychologicalincentive to work, she did not. Scripts were duly forwarded by her agent, sheread them, and dutifully they were returned.

In the autumn of 1970, Audrey was approached by a Europeanrepresentative of UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. Would shebe willing to appear in a special Christmas television program? Audreywould have simply to be seen briefly with a group of youngsters, singingwith them and greeting the hosts of the program in New York. The programwas to be called A World of Love.

She readily agreed, and on December 22, 1970, she was seen in Americafor the first time in three years. She sang and spoke in flawless Italian withthe children—many of them rescued from dire poverty—and then she ledthem in song. The filmed record of that brief appearance shows the childrencrowding around her, competing for the chance to hold her hand, whileAudrey reaches out and gathers them into her capacious embrace.

# Chapter Fifteen

1971–1986

“I’M AFRAID I may have nothing to express in a movie, since I’m muchfulfilled at home,” Audrey said in 1971.

Home was the Dottis’ penthouse, a busy spot in the center of Rome. Oncea cardinal’s residence, it measured about fifteen thousand square feet and hadsoaring ceilings and painted frescoes. The place easily accommodated theparents, two boys, a live-in staff and vast company for dinners—which werefrequent, as Andrea loved to entertain colleagues while stepping into thelimelight to exhibit his famous wife. They eventually sold the penthouse andrelocated to a smaller but no less sumptuous apartment in a neighborhoodthat had more abundant parks and trees nearby. For herself, Audrey preferredless exhausting social events like small dinners for old friends visiting Rome—the Pecks, the Wylers, the Zinnemanns and Kate and Lou, for example.

Among Audrey’s closest confidantes was the beautiful but ill-fated moviestar known as Capucine. Born Germaine Lefebvre, she had been brieflymarried as a teenager and then went on to bedazzle a legion of men—mostnotably, William Holden, with whom she made two movies. Audrey andCapucine had more in common than a past lover: they were both prone tobouts of serious depression, and at such times they offered each other asympathetic listening. While Audrey found that either work or love (or lovingduties) was an effective remedy, Capucine was often close to suicide andcounted very much on Audrey’s empathetic friendship. From the 1960s, shelived in Lausanne, not far from La Paisible, and when she was in good spirits,she, too, was a sensible and compassionate companion on whom Audreycould rely.

Audrey doted on her sons. “She did all the things that mothers do,”according to Sean: she awakened them in the morning, helped with theirschoolwork, read to them, took them to the movies and arranged for them tovisit friends. “She used to surprise my friends with how casual she was,”recalled Luca. “They expected something incredible, and instead they foundjust a nice person.” According to Sean, “she was also clear about what sheexpected of us…[and she] was as gentle as she was strong—the velvet gloveand the iron hand.” For the boys’ sake, she refused, for the moment, toresume her career. But she did accept a lucrative offer to make four one-minute commercials in a Rome studio for Exlan, a Tokyo wig manufacturer:she received more than $\$ 1$ million for a half-day’s work. That was the onlytime she was paid to appear before cameras in the eight years between April1967 and May 1975.

BY 1974, AUDREY’S life had all the appearances of an enviably comfortableroutine. She had enough money to satisfy both her needs and her caprices;her sons were healthy and well mannered; and she was the respected Signorala Contessa, the celebrated actress who had married an esteemed physician. Ifthe paparazzi would just leave her and the boys in peace, she said…

That year, Italy was traumatized by a kind of political unrest that oftenturned vicious and even homicidal. A wave of thefts and assaults affectedmany wealthy and politically active families, and many children of celebritieswere besieged by kidnappings and subsequent calls for ransom. Andrea wasvery nearly abducted at gunpoint near his office, but he was quickly saved bynearby carabinieri. Thereafter, the Dottis were always accompanied by abodyguard or two.

Audrey felt that life in Italy was starting to resemble wartime Holland, andshe did not want her boys to be in jeopardy or to live amid violence. Thusfourteen-year-old Sean followed Audrey and Mel’s suggestion that he attenda Swiss boarding school. Luca was only four and of course was not to be sentaway to school, but the brutalities in Rome were increasing as the so-calledRed Brigade swung into action. With that, the Dottis agreed that the boy

would be safer with Audrey in Tolochenaz, which she essentially made herprimary residence. This decision was both logical and reasonable at the time,and for a while, Andrea traveled back and forth on weekends. That summer,at age forty-five, Audrey was again pregnant—and for the fifth time, shemiscarried.

Simultaneously, the formidable Baroness van Heemstra gave up her homein San Francisco and came to live with Audrey. For over a decade, she hadworked raising funds to help train Vietnam veterans in peacetime jobs. For abrief time, Ella was her daughter’s de facto chief of staff at La Paisible,assuming the role of manager and putting to good use her experience as aLondon concierge. But she was, as Sean said, “a grande dame,” and whileAudrey made a comfortable life for her mother, “their personalities were notwell suited.” Ella turned seventy-four that year, and soon her health began tofail; over the next decade, she required ever more medical attention.

“I am incredibly busy,” Audrey told a journalist early in 1975. “Peoplealways ask me if I’m not bored just being a wife and mother. I’m not—not atall…I think you need time to live, to invest in the things you care for themost. For me, that is raising my boys. Children grow up by themselves, ofcourse, but they do need to be given love. That they can’t do by themselves.”

In January 1975, Frings sent yet another screenplay for her to consider, andthis time, Audrey was not so quick to reject the project. James Goldman hadwritten a witty and touching script about the middle-aged Robin Hood andMaid Marian, years after their colorful youth. He has returned from theCrusades, battered and weary, to find that she has become a nun and theabbess of a community in the English countryside. The wicked sheriff ofNottingham still scours Sherwood Forest in search of revenge against Robinand his merry men, for Little John has survived, along with Friar Tuck andWill Scarlett.

Goldman had written the award-winning play and film The Lion in Winter,about Henry II; his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine; and their sons, all pretendersto the English throne in the twelfth century. Among the distinctiveachievements of Lion was its fidelity to history and medieval life, on the one

hand; and the bold use of modern English diction and humor, on the other.Goldman had brilliantly brought Henry and Eleanor to life as figures whowere larger than life and altered the course of history, yet who bickered,bargained and plotted like any family caught in the fierce throes of politics. Incontrast, the main characters of Robin and Marian, for all their verisimilitude,were legendary. History itself was at stake in the earlier film; only theresumption of romance mattered in the new film. However sincere its charmand its understanding of the poignant impossibility of recapturing youthfulpassion, the new script was mostly a star vehicle.

Goldman’s screenplay appealed to Audrey perhaps because she sawMarian as a woman like herself. Each had given up one life for another thatwas radically different, and each had found that, however introverted, she stillhankered for romance. She also liked the idea of the fee that was offered— $\$ 1$million for thirty-six days of work. “It’s not that she was destitute,” saidRobert Wolders, who was later her companion, “but she had to replenish hercoffers.” There were, after all, the expenses of La Paisible and of her mother;and Audrey decided to buy another property, a small chalet in Gstaad.

The director of Robin and Marian was to be Richard Lester, who wasespecially skilled with stories that required a delicate blend of comedy andswift action and famous for two films starring the Beatles. Her leading manwas Sean Connery, and the cast included Robert Shaw, Nicol Williamson,Denholm Elliott and Kenneth Haigh—all of them dependable British players.The film was scheduled to be made in Spain between late May and early July,which seemed to Audrey an astoundingly quick plan. “Because my husbandencouraged me to do it,” she packed for Spain—accompanied by Luca andhis nanny; her personal hairdresser; her makeup artist; and an assistant. Shealso went with “stomach aches and clammy hands, because after all thoseyears, I didn’t know what to expect.”

The press, of course, buzzed with news of the so-called comeback ofAudrey Hepburn. “I never said that I was going to quit acting, to retire,” shesaid defensively. “Retirement means that if you do another picture, that’s a‘comeback.’ I’m not having a comeback. I may never make another movie!”One of the reasons she had enjoyed the long hiatus, she added, was that she

always found acting before the cameras a nerve-wracking business. “I’malways nervous when I start a picture. You take an awful chance every timeyou make a film. You never know how it’s going to come out.”

That must have occurred to her many times during the brief but tryingweeks in the forest and fields near Navarre. For one thing, she did not like therapidity of it all—one or two takes, and that was it for Lester, who knew whathe wanted and was not at all interested in protracting the romantic elementsof the story. Audrey had been accustomed to a longer time for shootingmultiple takes and for discussions with the cameraman as to what might beher best look in a particular scene. None of that seemed to matter here.

Nor was she amused or impressed when, during a sequence in which shewas to drive a wagon through a shallow river, the horse and cart turned over,and she and three other actors were plunged into knee-deep water.Recognizing a superb bit of comedy that he could never have planned andimplemented, Lester kept the camera rolling, sent Connery in to improvisedialogue, and included the scene in the picture to great comic effect—and toAudrey’s outspoken dismay. “It was actually very frightening even thoughthe water wasn’t deep,” she recalled. “With those heavy nuns’ habits gettingwaterlogged and pulling us down, it made things difficult.”

She was equally frustrated when she had a bout of laryngitis one day andcould manage only a gravelly rasp. No matter, said Lester: much if not mostof the picture would have to be postsynchronized in a recording studio in anycase. But when he heard the scene as recorded, he felt her hoarseness wasright for the tender scene with Nicol Williamson. The director’s biographerdocumented the production: “Down to the smallest detail, like having tomake do with an aluminum chair from her trailer instead of the canvas varietynormally provided, Hepburn let it be known, albeit in her supremely ladylikemanner, that she was used to better things.”

Richard Shepherd, who had produced Breakfast at Tiffany’s and who nowhad the same function for Robin and Marian, said at the time, “Audrey couldget along with Hitler, but Lester is not in her scrapbook of unforgettablecharacters.” If this was the new wave of filmmaking, she did not like it. “I’ve

never made a film so fast, and I would like to have had more time”—perhapsespecially since the circumstances of the thirty-six-day shoot made her“petrified the first day,” as she said, and “still shivering and shaking beforeeach take.”

When released in 1976, the film had mixed reactions from the critics, butAudrey’s return was heartily welcomed. She was forty-six when she acted inthe picture, and her smooth-skinned loveliness and remarkably youthfulfeatures were widely noted.

WHILE IN SPAIN, Audrey caught sight of some European tabloids that featuredcolor photos of her husband, cavorting in this or that nightclub with this orthat slinky young woman. They are just friends, said Andrea, who affectedshock when she expressed her suspicions after her return to Rome.

For the present, she did not pursue a divorce. “I hung on to both marriagesas long as I could, for the children’s sake. You always hope that if you lovesomebody enough, everything will be all right—but it isn’t always true.” Asthe summer heat enveloped Rome, she and Luca repaired to La Paisible. “Ithink she knew from the beginning who [Dotti] was,” said Sean, “yet I thinkshe dreamed and hoped that somehow she could change that. And I think shewas gravely disappointed when she realized she couldn’t.” As Audrey lateradmitted ruefully, “Dotti was not much of an improvement on Ferrer.”

According to Sean, Audrey loved both her husbands dearly and sustainedher marriages as long as she was able. “What she didn’t do was to speak upand be heard when she needed to, and she didn’t put up healthy boundaries.”He was referring, of course, to Dotti’s blatant infidelities: “My stepfather wasa brilliant and funny psychiatrist—but he was a hound dog. He just didn’tknow how to be faithful. Not a good choice of husband if what you arelooking for is security.”

Audrey was, according to Robert Wolders, “humiliated” by all this. “It wasespecially painful for her to have a second marriage fail.” As for Dotti, he

was frank but defensive: “I was no angel. Italian husbands have never beenfamous for being faithful.”

Security was not to be found in her second marriage, but she was not yetprepared to terminate it. Audrey allowed very few friends and no journaliststo the Dotti apartment, and when she had to submit to an interview, she wentto the home of a friend like Arabella Ungaro. There she met a few reporterswhen she was promoting Robin and Marian early in 1976, telling them,“There’s not one drop of tap water in my house today. From June toNovember, I had no hot water! I had to bathe at my husband’s studio. Youmight say I went to Spain last summer to make Robin and Marian just so Icould take a bath!”

Audrey agreed to travel to the United States for publicity surroundingRobin and Marian, and Andrea accompanied her. In New York, she wasscheduled to appear on the Today show, but she canceled because she wasunfamiliar with the interviewer, Barbara Walters, and no one would promisethat her private life would not be discussed. “She must have matters underher control,” said Dotti, “and she’s afraid of surprises.” He was quite right,and when Audrey felt she had lost that control, her anxieties multiplied.Asked to field questions at a press breakfast, she was visibly tense. “Herhands shook noticeably and she smoked without letup,” one reporter noted.

That March of 1976, the Dottis proceeded to Los Angeles for the Oscarceremony, at which she announced the statuette for best picture. “On camera,she was all serene elegance,” according to the same reporter, “but backstage,she was so nervous that she lost her purse and then refused to go to the pressroom after the telecast.”

Audrey was happier to attend the American Film Institute’s Salute toWilliam Wyler, to whom she paid a gracious tribute. “I’m not trying to becoy,” she told a journalist, speaking of Wyler, Wilder, Cukor, Donen andZinnemann,

but I really am a product of those [directors]. I’m no Laurence Olivier,no virtuoso talent. I’m basically rather inhibited and I find it difficult to

do things in front of people. What my directors have had in common isthat they’ve made me feel secure, made me feel loved. I depend terriblyon them. I was a dancer, and they managed to do something with me asan actress that was pleasing to the public.

By the spring of 1978, Audrey’s life with Andrea was effectively over,although she continued to tell the press that she was happily married; thedivorce decree would not be final until 1981. She took a small house with agarden, which she loved, according to Sean, “and regarded it as a workinggarden, cultivating the plants and then using the flowers in our house.” Thefinal revelation precipitating her commencement of legal action had been herdiscovery that, in her absences, Andrea conducted his romantic trysts in theirhome. “In her mind, this was the greatest failure of her life,” according toRobert Wolders. Refusing to believe that she could not change her husband’shabits by some sublime force of love, she simply blamed herself. And withthat, her depression became so profound that, for perhaps the first time in herlife, she seriously considered suicide.

As if on cue to alleviate her deepening despair, a script then came toAudrey’s door. At once, she agreed to appear in a movie called Bloodlinebecause, she said later, the director was her old friend Terence Young.*21That could have been the only reason she accepted a script that was utterlywithout merit. The immediate catalyst for her quick affirmative reply wastwofold: she needed to act like a survivor, and she would be paid over amillion dollars. The story, filmed between November 1978 and February1979, took her to New York, Paris, Rome and Sardinia. Luca was enrolled inRome’s Lycée Français and Sean was at a Swiss university, so Audrey agreedto work on location—but for no longer than three weeks at a time, so that shecould return home for visits.

At forty-nine, Audrey portrayed a character originally written in Sheldon’snovel as a twenty-three-year-old heroine; with a few adjustments, the rolewas forthwith reshaped for her—that of a woman who inherits a family-owned pharmaceutical house and who is threatened by people with a varietyof motives to kill her. No amount of rewriting remedied the witless story andscript (“Why would anyone want to do this to you?”). Like Audrey, the other

players could not resist the hefty fees offered; her co-stars included BenGazzara, James Mason, Irene Papas, Michelle Phillips, Omar Sharif andBeatrice Straight (Audrey’s old friend from the cast of The Nun’s Story).

In addition to the monumentally dreadful story and script, there weremultiple problems as filming began. “There was Irene Papas, who keptsaying she’d forgotten how to act,” recalled Straight, listing the troubles;“and James Mason, muttering he never again wanted to make a film hewasn’t also producing and directing; and Audrey, who had come with herown bodyguard but decided that on balance she’d rather be kidnapped by theMafia than have to complete the picture—so all in all, it wasn’t one of thebest.” Anxious throughout the production, Audrey smoked almost nonstop—on camera as well as off.

She arrived in New York for the first scenes, only to discover that manyyounger crew members were not quite sure who she was. But her co-starsdid, of course—most emphatically, Ben Gazzara, who thought that“something was already happening” at their first casual meeting.

The filming proceeded to a lush spot on the island of Sardinia, whereAudrey, almost desperate for affection, was remarkably bold in approachingGazzara, then still married to the actress Janice Rule. Awaiting his call to theset, he was reading a book when he noticed Audrey standing in front of him.The book, he said, had been good company the previous night, when he couldnot sleep. She had had trouble sleeping, too, she said, adding: “When ithappens to you again, feel free to call me. We’ll keep each other company.”For the moment, that was that.

Then, in Paris, Audrey and Ben had a kissing scene that was (in his words)“no movie kiss.” In Munich, they had lunch together one afternoon, andAudrey confided not only that Andrea had been unfaithful in her absences,but that he had chosen their home for his trysts. She was, she admitted, sodistraught that she had seriously contemplated suicide. The relationship wasconsummated very soon after. “No promises were made,” he recalled. “Forus it was going to be an ‘on-location romance.’” Or so Ben Gazzara intendedit to be—“end of movie, end of romance,” which, he admitted, was his

custom.

Much of the dialogue between Audrey and Ben had to be dubbed in Paris,where the affair continued at the Hôtel Crillon, “a night filled with far morefeeling than any other we’d had together.” The picture was completed, inearly 1979.

When Bloodline was released that June, the critics were appalled and thepublic bored by a movie of remarkable absurdity that might have been betterdirected by a first-year film student. “Faceless chic…bloodless, ludicrous andclumsy” were among the quieter journalistic dismissals. But the best verdicton the picture was delivered in character by the stalwart James Mason: “Ican’t take any more of it!”

By that time, Terence Young had already signed for his next job, whichwas to direct a film in Korea; Gazzara was to have a starring role, and noneother than Sean was engaged as a production assistant. Hence for Audrey,there were two reasons to visit Korea.

But after Gazzara began his work abroad, he discouraged Audrey fromvisiting: by this time, he was involved with a woman named Elke Stuckmann,who would become his third wife. There was no contact between him andAudrey until late that year, when she learned that they were in Rome. “I wantto see you,” she told him, calling his hotel suite. He replied that he was busy.According to Gazzara, he rang later to offer an explanation. “She answered,but I said nothing. A very long time passed with neither of us saying a word.She didn’t say my name. She simply whispered ‘Good-bye.’”

“Obviously I wasn’t in love,” Gazzara explained later. “I was flattered thatsomeone like that would be in love with me. But I didn’t know how deeplyshe was in love with me until I left her. She told others, not me, that I hadbroken her heart. She was so kind and sweet. And I hurt her.”

About this time, director Peter Bogdanovich sent to Ben (with whom hehad already collaborated) the first draft of his new script, called They AllLaughed. In considerable detail, Gazzara told Bogdanovich about his affairwith Audrey. “I took note of it all,” said the director, “and used this for the

character she eventually played opposite Gazzara in They All Laughed… Herreal life became the inspiration for the character I [re]wrote for her in ourpicture: a woman devoted to her young son, braving a jealous, philanderinghusband on the boy’s behalf, finds respite in a brief but intense love affair.”

Meanwhile, when Audrey learned that Ben would be in the picture, shesigned on at once, unwilling to abandon hope of some sort of continuingliaison with him—and perhaps not paying much attention to the script thenbeing rewritten. But as the new pages arrived, she agreed to participate,Gazzara said, “to play out our romance on the screen.” Perhaps she assentedto perform (in what was now so obviously a template of her own life) for thesalary: $\$ 1$ million for six weeks of work, plus a generous account forexpenses. With her presence guaranteed, They All Laughed was scheduled forproduction in late spring and early summer 1980. Bogdanovich also hiredSean as his personal assistant and gave him a small role in the film, a gesturethat of course pleased Audrey.

In early 1980, as filming approached, a brief meeting between Audrey andBen convinced her that the relationship was over. At once, she reneged on herpromise to participate in They All Laughed. That seriously threatened thefilm’s prospects—no Audrey, no film, many unemployed people, Sean out ofa job and a lot for her to justify publicly, as she would have to defend anaction unprecedented in her career. After some thought, she recanted herwithdrawal and made the picture, which was shot in New York between Apriland July 1980. “Audrey showed a lot of courage,” according to Ben Gazzara.That was as it may have been, but at that point he did not know that anotherman had replaced him in Audrey’s affections, and that she could now, withmore equanimity, perform her unusually explicit love scenes with Ben.

“AGEING DOESN’T BOTHER ME, but loneliness does,” she had said in the autumnof 1979, when she was fifty and working with Ben, for whom her love hadbeen unrequited.

After the divorce from Mel Ferrer, Audrey had been, as Givenchy said,

“miserable.” In 1968, not yet forty and no longer being offered sympatheticroles, she had embarked on a somewhat frantic period of nervous socializingin Rome. Then, in little more than a whirl of quixotic and ill-advised romancethe following year, Audrey had married a much younger man with style andprofessional credentials—a man who flattered her ego, to be sure, but whoeventually could not conform to her idea of a proper husband.

Benighted William Holden, who was often overwhelmed by his demons,could not have given her the children she so desired—nor could RobertAnderson, who in any case was steeped in grief over his wife’s recent death.The affair with Albert Finney ended over the strong likelihood of a threat toher relationship with Sean. And then there was Ben Gazzara, who saw histime with Audrey as a pleasant, short-term escapade with no furtherresponsibility. Reviewing her passional life, she might have thought that shehad not been, as the saying goes, lucky in love.

But just after Christmas 1979, Audrey was introduced at a dinner party to aman named Robert Wolders. Born Robertus Jacobus Godefridus Wolders inRotterdam, the Netherlands, in 1936, he had acted in a few televisionprograms and movies before he met Merle Oberon, the leading lady in hislast picture. Five feet ten inches tall and attractive, with expressive greeneyes, subtle humor and a keen mind, Wolders was an asset at any Hollywoodgathering and enormously appealing to Oberon, who was twenty-five yearshis senior. In 1975, after their joint work on a picture, they were married andlived at her home in Malibu until her death at the age of sixty-eight inNovember 1979.

Of the evening Audrey and Wolders met, she said, “I was charmed withhim, but he didn’t register much. We were both very unhappy: he was gettingover the death of Merle, and I was in one of the worst periods of my life, thelow ebb of divorce. So we both cried into our beers.” Fortunately for them,they could communicate in their native Dutch as well as their expressiveEnglish, and their shared national background was no small element in theformation of a bond.

“I got a kick out of exchanging a few words with her in Dutch,” Wolders

recalled. “But I thought that would be it.” Contrary to cynical whisperings,Wolders was no vulgar opportunist, for Oberon had bequeathed him(according to writer Sheilah Graham) a “great collection of jewels…[and]Mr. Wolders sold them all at auction for several million dollars.” Very soon,he was Robbie to Audrey and Rob to her friends.

In the spring of 1980, Audrey was in New York, in residence at the HotelPierre during the production of They All Laughed; Wolders was in LosAngeles. She rang Rob, after which he told himself, “That’s it—I have to goto New York.” He did so. “We had to be very discreet. She was still married,even though unhappily, to Andrea. Eventually, we realized the only thing todo was for me to move to Europe and live in Switzerland.”

THEY ALL LAUGHED did not find much favor with critics or audiences, whowere confused by the bittersweet and not very interesting stories of severalnot very interesting couples. The action was badly paced, frenetic onemoment and languid the next, and it was difficult for audiences to know justhow they were to feel about anyone. Those aware of Audrey’s real-life affairwith Ben Gazzara—politely alleged by gossip columnists at the time—maywell have felt a sort of winking guilt, especially during the embarrassing andawkward bedroom sequence.

But the real crime of the picture was that it gave Audrey no chance toappear anything other than bored. She trotted around the streets of Manhattanin a state of blank bemusement, wearing a black jacket, very tight jeans,stiletto-heeled leather boots and huge dark glasses—a Manhattan discodenizen aiming for the high life but reaching into low dives and bedroomswith the private detective hired to pursue her. “Mr. Bogdanovich treatsAudrey Hepburn so shabbily,” wrote the New York Times movie critic, “thatif this were a marriage instead of a movie, she’d have grounds for divorce.”As for the male lead: “Mr. Gazzara can’t even smile convincingly.”Evidently, the critic did not know why.

A tragic corollary of the production was also the most unhelpful element in

the film’s unfortunate destiny. Bogdanovich, then forty-one, had met andfallen in love with a twenty-year-old Playboy model named Dorothy Stratten,whom he cast in his picture. At the time, she was married to an unbalancedhustler named Paul Snider. Two weeks after Bogdanovich completed filming,she moved into the director’s home and told Snider she was leaving him. OnAugust 14, he lured her to their former apartment, assaulted her and then shother to death and turned the rifle on himself. Despite Audrey’s name, thisnegative publicity made it impossible for the director to find a distributoruntil late the following year.

IN JULY, JUST after Audrey returned from filming in New York, Ella suffereda third stroke. “I have just brought her back from the hospital,” Audrey wroteto her father’s wife, Fidelma. “I have been nursing her day and night, herheart is very bad and she has just had a third stroke…I have been strugglingto find a way to come to see Daddy—but everything always happens atonce!…Added to all this, my marriage is in bad shape so am suffering on allsides…I am very torn about all this, but I can only do the best I can.”

To Audrey’s relief, the infirm Ella liked Rob when he arrived. “There wassome tension between Audrey and her mother,” he recalled, “because hermother was very strict and severe and had difficulty showing all the affectionshe felt—and she felt a great deal for Audrey, but she couldn’t express it. Soshe would use me as a conduit because she knew I would convey all that shefelt to Audrey, plus she was very tickled by the fact that we could speakDutch.”

The life Audrey and Rob shared had a quiet, almost elegiac routine. Theyrose early, took a light breakfast, walked their Jack Russell terriers, putteredin the garden, read the mail and newspapers and shopped for meals at thelocal market. After a light lunch, they had an afternoon siesta, and thenAudrey allowed herself a piece of chocolate, took a stroll through nearbyvineyards and returned to the house. She did a few household chores,strolling about with her pack of cigarettes and her nightly drink of scotchbefore dinner. In the evening, she and Rob watched tapes of favorite

television shows, and they retired early. This was not the madcap life of jet-set celebrities but the serene style of retired country gentlefolk. Only rarelydid a special event lure them to Paris, Rome, New York or Los Angeles—anawards ceremony for her or a close colleague (William Wyler and FredAstaire, for example), or a few days of work that paid handsomely. 22 Almostalways, she traveled with her dogs, and when airline attendants objected, sheprevailed. “It’s the only time I act like Audrey Hepburn the movie star,” shesaid.

In 1981, a sad episode brought them to Dublin, where Audrey’s father,then ninety-two, was also failing. Since 1959, they had met only once, whenhe and Fidelma accepted her invitation to visit La Paisible. His withdrawn,remote attitude was unchanged even in his last days, and doctors said theyhad no idea how long he would linger. Audrey and Rob departed after twodays, during which Ruston (like Ella) could admit his regrets and proclaimhis pride in her only by speaking these sentiments to others. He died withinthe week.

In the summer of 1982, at the time her final divorce decree from Andreawas announced, Audrey’s dear friend Cathleen Nesbitt died at ninety-three.Ella finally succumbed in August 1984, after ten years of devoted care byAudrey and her staff. All during her adulthood, Audrey had sent gifts of cashto her parents and paid for extraordinary care when necessary.

“I was lost without my mother,” Audrey said later. “She had been mysounding board, my conscience. She was not the most affectionate person—in fact there were times when I thought she was cold—but she loved me inher heart, and I knew that all along. I never got that feeling from my father,unfortunately.”

There were other losses, too, and they affected Audrey very deeply.William Wyler and Kathryn Hulme died in 1981, George Cukor in 1983 andMarie Louise Habets in 1986. Each of them had grown closer to her duringthe years after their collaborations; each was in a way a parent figure; eachhad cherished and encouraged Audrey. Her memories of them were indelible,and their names were often in her conversations.

IN 1986, AUDREY took a role in her only movie made for television—LoveAmong Thieves, directed by Roger Young. He arrived at La Paisible late oneafternoon to discuss the production, and his hosts offered him a drink. Hethought he should decline—but not after Audrey piped up, “Well, I’m havinga drink!” Over glasses of Glenlivet, they talked about the shooting schedulein Arizona and California.

Later, in Los Angeles, the cast gathered for a script reading at the home ofRobert Wagner, who was starring with Audrey. Everyone seemed pleased,but during a break in the reading, she motioned to Roger Young to stepoutside for a moment. “Listen, Roger,” she whispered, “R. J. [Wagner’snickname among close friends and colleagues] is really a big television star.You’ve got to help me—I can’t let him down!” He calmed her nerves andinsisted that she would, of course, be splendid in the production. Later thatafternoon, R. J. motioned to Roger to step outside for a moment: “Roger,you’ve got to help me! That is Audrey Hepburn in there—she’s a majormovie star, and I don’t want to let her down!”

According to Young, neither one let the other down. “The script [byStephen Black and Henry Stern] was written with the Audrey of Breakfast atTiffany’s in mind—and this impossible anachronism was what the producerdemanded.”

The early scenes were appropriately filmed with Audrey’s character as herown age, which was fifty-eight in 1987—and that is what she preferred toplay. But despite Audrey and Roger’s disagreement with him, the producersaw the first scenes and insisted on turning back the clock. “She said shewould try to please him,” Young recalled, “but she understandably becamemore and more uncomfortable with the project. And she was proven right bythe critics, who were incensed that the movie had taken away the matureAudrey Hepburn and made her dance on the end of a string as a youngerversion of herself.” The film was not what it should have been, said Young,and he assumed full responsibility for it; years later, he said, “I let her down,and it pains me to this day.” Audrey felt, quite rightly, that the blame was not

Young’s but the producer’s.

As for Robert Wagner, an actor held in high and affectionate regard, hevery much enjoyed reviving a friendship with Audrey that had begun yearsearlier, when they were young players at Paramount. “She was not merelywonderful to work with,” he recalled, adding memories of his visits to herand Rob at La Paisible. “Everything about her that was so good was reflectedin her home, her furniture, the art, the flowers—even her dogs. And herkindness was extraordinary, not just to me but to everyone on the production.And of course she was so good, always a loyal friend staying in touch withCapucine, who was going through so many bad times. She raised the bar foreveryone, and I felt so blessed to visit her at home in the years after ourmovie, and to have her friendship.”

After Love Among Thieves was broadcast on February 23, 1987, itvanished from the network’s library, and no viewing copy was available inany television archive as late as 2005. As for Capucine, she later committedsuicide at her home in Lausanne at the age of fifty-nine.

# Chapter Sixteen

1987–1990

IN THE AUTUMN of 1987, Audrey and Rob took a holiday trip to the Far East.One of her cousins, working in the diplomatic corps at Macao, on the Chinesecoast, had invited her to be an honored guest at the International MusicFestival held there, which had scheduled a concert benefiting the UnitedNations Children’s Fund. She and Rob gladly agreed to include the event intheir schedule.

Founded in 1946, UNICEF works to save, protect and improve the lives ofchildren in more than 160 countries by making available immunization,education, health care, nutrition, sanitation and clean water. Funded entirelyby voluntary contributions from individuals, foundations, businesses andgovernments, it has always been nonpartisan and nonprofit and has, since itsinception, worked free of discrimination and without political agenda.UNICEF’s priority has always been to meet the needs of the mostdisadvantaged children in the neediest places of the world; in this regard, ithas responded to the results of natural disasters as well as civil andinternational strife.

“Due to my own early experiences, I can testify to what UNICEF means tochildren,” Audrey told the audience at the festival. “I have kept a long-lastinggratitude to them and a trust in what they can do.” Her remarks were brief butdeeply felt, and she was besieged by the press to elaborate.

From Macao, she and Rob proceeded to Tokyo, where Audrey had alsoagreed to be mistress of ceremonies for a concert by the World PhilharmonicOrchestra, again because they were performing a benefit for UNICEF.

Christa Roth, who was special events coordinator for UNICEF and itsgoodwill ambassadors, met them in Tokyo, arranged the details and veryquickly became Audrey’s close friend and confidante. “She was so natural,relaxed and beautiful,” Christa recalled. “It seemed inevitable that everyonewould pay attention to her, and they did. She started by putting me at ease—there was nothing of the prima donna, nothing of the great movie star orfashion icon about her. She was just there to help a cause she believed in.”

Christa had arranged a press conference at the hotel, where Audrey, whohad done her homework, introduced the orchestra members and discussed thework of UNICEF. “We had picked a room that accommodated about twenty-five or thirty members of the press,” Christa recalled. “But we looked outsideand saw a line around the corner, so we had to move to the ballroom. Hereffect on people in Japan was phenomenal. She had always been a fashionidol for Japanese girls, and now the international press discovered that shewas also a serious woman with serious concerns.” That day, according toChrista, was like a national event.

“I guess everyone reaches a point in his life where he wants to find outwho he is and what he wants his life to be,” Audrey said. Back at La Paisiblefor Christmas, she reached that point. Was there not something more shecould do for UNICEF? In her own estimation, her career had begun to fade inher mind like a watercolor exposed to the sun—perhaps especially in theharsh light of the essential silliness of her recent movies. She was paidexceedingly well for them, and so there was no anxiety for her own and herfamily’s future. But now that Sean was twenty-seven and Luca seventeen andshe seemed comfortably settled with Rob, what would attract her energy, andwhat was the deepest need of her nature? She was fifty-eight, and she wanted—indeed, needed—a new and deeper purpose in her life. She was, as KateHulme had said, hungry for something more.

Her visits to Macao and Tokyo guided her in the right direction. As shehad said so often since her own childhood, she was drawn to care for childrenwhen she was little more than one herself; she had longed to be a mother andwould, had she been able, have borne several more. “I’ve been given anenormous privilege,” she said as she began to alter her entire life that season.

“It’s to speak for those children who can’t speak for themselves. It’s an easytask, because children have no enemies. To save a child would be such ablessing.”

“And so she came to us,” Christa said. “She said that if she could give hername and her fame to UNICEF in such a way that it would help our work,she wanted to do that. That was how it began.”

At first, UNICEF officials in New York and Geneva said they would bepleased if Audrey would be a kind of media symbol, making publicstatements, being mistress of ceremonies at fund-raising dinners or galabenefits or appearing in television or radio announcements asking fordonations.

But that was not her way. She insisted on taking her cue from the actorDanny Kaye, UNICEF’s first goodwill ambassador: from 1954 almost to hisdeath in 1987, he had traveled the world on behalf of suffering children. Herfame, Audrey reasoned, had a clear benefit she could now exploit. She couldattract attention—and so she would focus the eyes of the world on what wasnecessary to save the poor, the starving, the uneducated, the abused childreneverywhere. She could speak for those who had no forum; she couldapproach those in power and beg—even demand—that whatever hostilitiesengaged men running powerful nations, children everywhere must not beblithely permitted to suffer for the sins of the elders.

ON MARCH 1, 1988, Audrey wrote her formal application to be accepted as agoodwill ambassador for UNICEF. Answering the pages of questions, shegave a summary of her background and early life, her dance studies, herwitness to the German invasion of Holland, the tragedies of her family, thedeprivations of wartime, the Battle of Arnhem—and her clear memory of therelief provided in 1945 by the Red Cross and UNRRA. She informedUNICEF that she was a citizen of the United Kingdom, that she traveled on aBritish passport and that she was fluent in English, Dutch, French and Italian.

On the application form, she was asked to reply to the question “Why doyou come to UNICEF?” Her answer sealed her acceptance: “I have alwaysaccepted opportunities to help whenever offered [to] me, such as Christmas-card sales, Christmas TV fundraising in Rome, the Macao Music Festival andthe ‘Music and Peace’ Concert by the World Philharmonic Orchestra inTokyo—all benefiting UNICEF.” She concluded: “I have been offered byUNICEF an opportunity to assist with any project on which I might be useful—this is for me an immense privilege and an answer to my longing to helpchildren in whatever small way I can.” That might have been Sister Luke’sreply to the question “Why do you want to go to the children of the Congo?”

A week later, she received word of her appointment as a goodwillambassador for UNICEF, for which she would receive the compensation ofone American dollar per year. Her travel expenses would be paid by theorganization and its contributors, but they would be at nothing like celebritystatus, because the funds were supervised by the United Nations itself. Often,the lowest fares and accommodations had to be sought, which meant manystops before reaching a destination.

Eight days after her acceptance and a series of immunization injections,Audrey and Rob set off to visit the east African nation of Ethiopia, then thepoorest nation in the world. The degree of personal risk here was very high,as there were epidemics of bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis, typhoid fever,malaria, rabies and meningitis. “She and Rob traveled in military planes,sitting on sacks of rice,” recalled Christa Roth. “She asked for no specialconsiderations, and she got none.” The goal of the trip was to call attention tothe severe drought conditions there, and, according to UNICEF archives,Audrey received more media coverage than any goodwill ambassador in itshistory.

She visited the Ouiha Health Center and, with an interpreter’s help, spokewith mothers and children as well as the doctor of the makeshift clinic. Shewalked through a refugee camp, where people attempted to loosen the driedsoil for planting; she took parched and hungry children in her arms; shediscussed with people the construction methods they used when they hadcash gifts for water projects. “I’m very impressed by the people of Ethiopia,”

she said at a press conference that evening,

and by their beauty, by their dignity, by their patience and by theirenormous desire and will to help themselves—not simply to sit therewaiting…They deserve help not only because they are the poorestpeople in the world and are receiving the least aid, but because they area brave people and they do so much for themselves.

And then she told the press about UNICEF: “There aren’t any bannerssaying, ‘This is a UNICEF project.’ The important thing is that, given thespade that UNICEF can give them, they will dig a well. What we have tomake sure is that they don’t use the spade to dig graves for their children.”

Next day, Audrey again met with the press.

Surely caring is better than killing. We care for our own children whenthey go through a crisis, when they have an accident or are stricken bydisease—not only during that moment, but also through what may be afairly long convalescence. If we can do that for our own children, Icertainly think we can do it for all those silent children that I sawyesterday and today at the refugee camp. And I firmly believe that thosechildren are our sacred charge.

As she said to a reporter from Time magazine, “It is a menacing emergencyhere now [in Ethiopia]. As Gandhi said, ‘Wars cannot be won by bullets, butonly by bleeding hearts.’ I think we can help all these beautiful, silentchildren.”

Her colleagues at UNICEF were at once impressed by a major differencebetween Audrey’s work for them and that of other volunteers. It is standardprocedure that celebrities, like politicians and others, read speeches preparedand written by experts. But Audrey researched and wrote her own texts,preparing and rewriting her remarks both for the press and for her UNICEFreports. At home, she read books and journals about the country she was tovisit, studying like a scholar preparing for an important examination—and

then, after her research, she put questions, in writing or by telephone, to hercolleagues at UNICEF headquarters. “You can’t just get up and say, ‘Oh, I’mhappy to be here, and I love children,’” Audrey said of her homework. “No,it’s not enough to know that there’s been a flood in Bangladesh and seventhousand people lost their lives. Why the flood? What is their history? Whyare they one of the poorest countries today? How are they going to survive?Are they getting enough help? What are the statistics? What are theirproblems?”

Christa Roth recalled Audrey’s method in preparing her talks and remarksfor press conferences and fund-raisers. “Sometimes the New York office sentrough speeches for her, or an outline, and then she wrote a new one inlonghand—and in large print, because she preferred not to use her glasseswhen she glanced at her remarks.”

The organization’s central archives contain an enormous cache of materialrelevant to Audrey Hepburn’s voluntary tenure with UNICEF—hundreds ofpages in her clear handwriting, speeches written and rewritten, notes addedand removed, books and articles noted and referenced, questions put toUNICEF staff. “When I visit sick children and then report to their communityleaders or to the press,” she noted in one report, “they know that I’m withUNICEF, and that thrills them more than Breakfast at Tiffany’s.”

When someone objected that there have always been suffering childrenand there always will be—and that perhaps one merely prolonged thatsuffering by treating them, Audrey had a quick response: “Okay, let’s startwith your grandchild. Don’t buy antibiotics if he gets pneumonia; don’t takehim to the hospital if he has an accident. It’s against life, against humanity, tothink that way!”

That year, Audrey began to travel on a United Nations passport, as“Audrey K. Hepburn.” And to Horst Cerni, a UNICEF photographer, shewrote after her first four trips: “I am tickled pink by my little red U.N.passport!!!! It’s a sore temptation not to ‘show off ’ with it…UNICEF iskeeping me going—and young!”

Over the next five years, her schedule never spared her energies, and 1988provides an example of the actions she undertook on behalf of UNICEF—work that filled seven to eight months of every year. “I auditioned for this jobfor forty-five years,” she said, “and finally I got it. I always felt verypowerless when I saw the terrible pictures on television. But I was offered awonderful opportunity to do something.”

Early in her travels, some former colleagues were astonished. “Never in amillion years would I have predicted that Audrey would give so much, soselflessly and at such personal cost to a cause like UNICEF,” said StanleyDonen. “In the years we made movies together, Audrey was much moreconcentrated on her own work and its gratifications. So this is a trueevolution. Audrey’s really grown up; she’s come of age and entered anotherstage of life where her concern for others extends beyond her concern forherself.”

“No,” countered Rex Harrison, “it’s just the sort of thing she would do.She was brought up in Holland during the war, remember. That’s a verydifferent sort of background from American kids. She understands theurgency of hunger and deprivation in a personal, immediate way.”

Leaving Ethiopia on March 18, she and Rob spent a week at home, whereAudrey prepared for a trip to New York. On March 23, she gave a pressconference at UNICEF’s Manhattan headquarters. Thirty-five journalistswere present, and after their questions were answered, she gave threeindividual interviews. The same day, she appeared on two network televisionprograms to discuss the needs of the Ethiopian people, and on the twenty-fourth, she was driven to the two major morning programs for the samepurpose. Four more television appearances were on the schedule that day, andbetween interviews, she recorded television appeals for UNICEF, attended anadvocacy luncheon and went to an evening reception for major contributors.The workday lasted twenty hours.

This schedule would have wearied even an ambitious political candidate,but Audrey did not stop. The next day, March 25, she attended acongressional breakfast in Washington, met with members of the Foreign

Affairs Committee and fielded questions from the Washington press corps;she also gave interviews on no less than six radio shows. On Saturdaymorning, March 26, she and Rob flew to Toronto, where reporters were atfirst more interested in her career than in humanitarian endeavors. She smiledgraciously and deflected those questions, instead going straight to the issue ofEthiopia’s desperate need for water. “Miss Hepburn was fully forthcomingwith answers—even to tough political questions,” reported George Kassis ofUNICEF’s Canadian Committee. After the press conference, she granted nineinterviews and made three media appearances.

On the twenty-seventh, she flew to London for an eight-day fund-raisingtour and the next day was seen on nine British television programs.

“I was a little cynical about the set-up at first,” wrote one British journalistwho trailed her around London,

but as soon as Ms. Hepburn began speaking, all doubts fell away. Hercommitment is passionate and sincere. She seemed near tears as shetalked about “the heart-rending and also heart-warming” sights she hadseen in Ethiopia. Someone asked a rather hostile question about theEthiopian government’s controversial resettlement policy, but Ms.Hepburn fielded it intelligently, admitting that the government hadpanicked in the famine of 1985, but that conditions were nowimproving.

Later that afternoon, during an interview at her hotel, Audrey welcomedthe same journalist, while gratefully accepting a large scotch whiskey fromRob. “I’m not a lush,” she said, “but I’ve been up since four and I need apick-me-up.” The reporter noted that she “chain-smoked, too, [and was]clearly ragged with exhaustion.”

That day, Audrey spoke of Rob’s participation in her new vocation:“We’ve done all this together. He’s just as passionate about it as I am, and sosupportive.” The following year, he was engaged by UNICEF as Audrey’smanager—“to coordinate/facilitate field missions, advocacy appearances,media interviews and participation and meetings and conferences of

Goodwill Ambassador Audrey Hepburn, and [to] assist Miss Hepburn in thepreparation and execution of these activities on behalf of UNICEF.” Shecould not have managed this important work without him, and UNICEFrecognized this. In 1989, Rob was paid $\$ 2,200$ , and from September toDecember 1991 another $\$ 1,500$ —token compensation for the countlessdetails he supervised and the interference he ran on Audrey’s behalf. “Audreywanted Rob to travel with her,” according to Christa. “I arranged the basicsfor the programs in each place, and Rob protected her from unreasonabledemands and kept her on schedule, too. She wanted things properly prepared,and he was a great help in that regard.”

“Each time [we traveled],” he recalled, “she deliberated carefully overwhether she could make a difference. She studied endlessly and becameextremely knowledgeable. But she was not trying to be Mother Teresa orvying for sainthood.”

After a brief return to Tolochenaz, Audrey gave an international pressconference in Geneva on April 6, and then she and Rob hurried to Turkey forthree days, where there was a massive UNICEF effort to immunize childrenagainst measles, tuberculosis, tetanus, whooping cough, diphtheria and polio.She visited clinics and helped with injections before speaking to reportersabout epidemics that unnecessarily kill hundreds of millions of childrenannually. A whirlwind journey to Los Angeles for the Oscar telecastfollowed; she and Gregory Peck gave awards, and she insisted on makingtime for more than fifteen interviews to bring UNICEF’s work to greaterpublic awareness in California.

Readers of Vogue saw her photo in an advertisement for Revlon that year.For this, Audrey received a fee of $\$ 50,000$ —to which she added another$10,000 and donated the entire sum to the victims of the Armenianearthquake.

For the remainder of 1988, she was on field missions to the poor ofVenezuela and Ecuador, and she spearheaded fund-raising events in Austria,Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Ireland and America.By Christmas, she had visited fourteen countries and raised more than $\$ 22$

million. In the days of movie promotions, she had agreed to only three or fourinterviews in a day; for UNICEF, she did no less than fifteen daily in NewYork and Washington and at least ten elsewhere. When someone expressedadmiration for the sacrifices she was making, her response was swift: “It’snot a sacrifice! A sacrifice means you give up something you want forsomething you don’t want. This is no sacrifice, it’s a gift I am receiving.”

During these five busy years, she was no less anxious in front of crowdsthan before. “I get very nervous, you know, when I have to speak at theseconferences.” Those who were with her took note of her anxiety, her shakinghands, her dry mouth. “The whole thing terrified me, and still does. Acting issomething quite different from getting up in front of people over and overagain in so many countries. Speaking is something that is terribly important.”

Audrey was no less anxious about television interviews. Karen Cadle, asuccessful independent producer, booked stars on the Hour Magazinetelevision program from 1980 to 1988. At the beginning of Audrey’s workfor UNICEF, and just before the show ended its run, Karen approachedAudrey about appearing. “We met at a Los Angeles hotel,” Karen recalled. “Ithought she was a remarkable woman, but I also found her shy, introverted,quiet and a bit scared about the idea of coming on the program.” But becauseit would benefit UNICEF’s cause, Audrey agreed. “Of all the stars and all thenotable persons we booked over eight years,” Karen continued, “she was themost anticipated person of all.”

When Audrey arrived at the studio for the taping, she said to Karen, “I justneed two things: a cup of coffee and—do you have any bourbon?”

“I realized then just how nervous she was. But we came up with what shewanted, and Audrey felt better. Still, she needed a lot of reassurance beforeshe went on the show. I was happy to give her that, and I told her that theaudience would love her—which of course they did. I then told the host ofthe show to begin the conversation gently, to talk about Audrey’s two grownsons and then move on briefly to her movies before spending the majority ofthe time speaking about UNICEF.

“But it was plain to see that Audrey was never comfortable before anaudience. She did relax for one moment, however. She had to smile at thehost’s first question, which was ‘Tell me about your two daughters.’” Afterthe first segment of the show had been taped and there was an interval,Audrey came to Karen and asked, “Did I do anything wrong?”

AUDREY OFTEN REMINDED listeners that the specific problems that causedchildren so much suffering came from greater causes than famine, drought,floods or any natural disaster. “We are dealing with a far more ominous threatthan sickness and death,” she said in April 1989.

We are dealing with the dark side of humanity—selfishness, avarice,aggression. All this has already polluted our skies, emptied our oceans,destroyed our forests and extinguished thousands of beautiful animals.Are our children next?…It is no longer enough to vaccinate them or givethem food and water and only cure the symptoms of man’s tendency todestroy everything we hold dear.

Audrey’s voice broke, and she brushed away a tear before continuing:“Whether it be famine in Ethiopia, excruciating poverty in Guatemala andHonduras, civil strife in El Salvador or ethnic massacre in the Sudan, I sawbut one glaring truth: these are not natural disasters but man-made tragediesfor which there is only one man-made solution—peace.” She never lost sightof the larger issue: even UNICEF’s programs would be threatened as long asnation continued to lift sword against nation.

In February 1989, Audrey visited Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador andMexico, supervising the openings of new drinking water systems in slumareas and surveying rural health centers. She also met with the vice presidentof Guatemala, the president of Honduras and the president of El Salvador andoffered specific programs to benefit the children of Central America. InApril, she appeared before the House Foreign Operations Sub-Committee andthe House Select Sub-Committee on World Hunger. “There is no deficit inhuman resources,” she said in a strong voice. “There is only a deficit in

human will.”

That same month, she spent five days in the Sudan, where she found amalnourished boy of fourteen lying on an earthen floor. “He had acuteanemia, respiratory problems and edema—swelling of the limbs,” she saidlater. “And that was exactly the same way I finished the war.” Audrey alsosupervised deliveries of food and medical supplies from Khartoum to Kosti.According to UNICEF archives, “she also traveled the difficult roads to therebel-held Southern Sudan, where she met with rebel leaders.” She thenvisited camps for refugees.

There was one final role she accepted in a commercial film. Just after hersixtieth birthday, in early summer 1989, Audrey received her usual fee of $\$ 1$million for a few days of work in Steven Spielberg’s romantic fantasyAlways. Dressed in a plain white sweater and white pants, she portrayed Hap,an angelic guide to a young pilot (Richard Dreyfuss) who has just died in anairplane accident. “You’ve had your life, and anything you do just foryourself is a waste of spirit,” she says, urging him to return unseen to earthlylife to help others and to free himself from painful memories. Without heavymakeup to cover the lines of character and age around her eyes and mouth,and with her chestnut hair drawn back and tied at the neck, Audrey was afigure of radiant simplicity in a film candied with the usual Hollywood brandof bogus mysticism. Speaking almost in a whisper, and with the accent ofwisdom instead of large gestures or expressions, she was quietly credible as aguide to a mysterious life beyond expectations.

At the same time, she was looking for a text that could be set to music—asin Macao and Tokyo, that had been a way to raise substantial funds forUNICEF. She wanted something that would not require her to attend a galadinner and, wearing a stunning Givenchy gown, solicit large donations fromwealthy patrons. Instead, at her suggestion, UNICEF offered to commissionthe composer and conductor Michael Tilson Thomas to create a concertpiece. Audrey suggested that they might somehow use The Diary of AnneFrank. “I was exactly the same age as Anne Frank,” she said. “We were bothten when war broke out and fifteen when the war finished. I was given thebook in Dutch. I read it, and it destroyed me. This was my life.”

“We both reread The Diary of Anne Frank and highlighted our favoritepassages,” he recalled, “and then we sent them to each other.” On February28, 1990, Audrey wrote out forty pages of excerpts from the diary and postedthem to Michael; she then made a tape recording. “I listened to her reading,”Tilson Thomas added, “and I developed the idea of composing the kind ofmusic that could be a counterpart to her voice and intonation.”

They met several times during the late summer and early autumn of 1989,mostly in Miami Beach, where Tilson Thomas resided during the months ofhis annual commitment as director of the New World Symphony, which hefounded in 1987. “After I began to organize the text, Audrey and I discussedhow much the libretto would refer to the Holocaust. It had to make thatconnection, of course, but we wanted to stress the overall hopefulness of thebook.” The piece was, after all, to be used for a UNICEF benefit, and theyworked each day to emphasize the theme of the optimism of childhood. “TheAnne Frank spirit was forgiving,” said Tilson Thomas. “This is not a grim,horrific piece, although it is sad and disturbing. Anne is a special person, awonderful spirit, even though we know she had an unhappy ending.” ForAudrey, “She is certainly a symbol of the child in very difficultcircumstances, which is what I devote all my time to now. She transcends herdeath.”

Once his composition was complete, Tilson Thomas played a pianoversion for Audrey, who liked it enormously—“but she was afraid of it at thesame time,” he added, “because at last it dawned on her that she would haveto do this in performance. Some parts were very intricate for her vocalentrance and exit, even though I had tried to write so that there was someleeway for her. Nevertheless, it was tricky, especially for people who don’tread music. But we worked hard and finally got it together.” Above all,Audrey appreciated that the composition was musically dramatic andevocative, and she would not be required to act it. “She was very firm aboutthat,” the composer recalled. “She did not want to try to be—or to sound like—Anne Frank, but rather to read it sympathetically.”

During her working sessions and rehearsals with Michael Tilson Thomas,Audrey confided her thoughts about working for UNICEF. “I was so lucky in

my career, from the very start,” she said. “I didn’t know much of anythingwhen I began, but I got parts in which I could pretty much just be myself.Then all this stardom and celebrity took off. But what is the purpose of allthat if you don’t do something constructive with it?”

They presented the world premiere of his composition From the Diary ofAnne Frank on March 12, 1990, in Philadelphia and then performed the workin Chicago, Houston, New York and London. Reviews of both the work andthe performance were most enthusiastic, and music critics everywheredeclared it an important composition that belonged in the standard catalog.

That year, Audrey was asked to be the host for a documentary series oftelevision programs about the great gardens of the world, and so she traveledfrom April to June for the filming—in England, France, the United States,Japan, the Netherlands, Italy and the Dominican Republic. The producers atPublic Broadcasting presumed that she would require a team of peopleaccompanying her: a personal assistant, a hairdresser, a makeup artist, awardrobe mistress. They also knew that those people would of course addseveral hundred thousand dollars to the budget.

But as they were trying to raise the money, producer Janis Blackschlegerhad a phone call from Audrey: “You know, I was thinking—if you could getme a hair dryer every fourth day wherever we are, and an ironing board andan iron, I’ll do my own hair and I’ll do my own makeup and I’ll do my ownwardrobe.” Blackschleger protested, but Audrey laughed: “No, no—I like toiron!”

And that was how she saved the company an enormous amount of money—doing all her own chores while she traveled with the crew for threemonths. “She was always on time and ready to work,” recalledBlackschleger. “She could give lessons on celebrity behavior.” Gardens ofthe World was a miniseries aimed at television release in 1991, but then itwas decided to expand it to eight segments. By that time, Audrey was unableto do additional commentary, nor to introduce viewers to the lush gardens.The series was finally broadcast after she died.

To no one’s surprise, it was then learned that Audrey had donated her feeto UNICEF. She had loved walking among the great gardens for this series,which brought back memories of her summer when she had toured gardenson the English coast with her mother—and of course, she loved her gardensat La Paisible. Careful not to upstage the flowers, she wore only the simplestoutfits, and her delivery of the text was both natural and full of quietenthusiasm.

A FUND-RAISING CONFERENCE and musical gala brought her to Oslo, on August29, 1990. After addressing the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, Audreywas asked to present the great mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade to theaudience at a benefit concert.

“How would you like to be introduced?” she asked the singer.

“As Flicka,” she replied, using the nickname known to all her friends andfans. “Backstage, Audrey and I spoke mostly about our children,” sherecalled years later. “And it was great fun for me to tell her that, when I wasabout eighteen or nineteen and working as a salesgirl at Tiffany’s in NewYork, she came in to pick up an order of printed stationery, and I waited onher. That was a day I never forgot!”

Before, during and after these engagements, Audrey continued her travels—most remarkably, to the provinces of Vietnam and to the slums of Thailandand Bangladesh, where she discussed programs for homeless children, for theeradication of slums and for women’s rights. “My task is to inform, to createawareness,” she told a journalist who challenged her effectiveness. “It wouldbe nice to be an expert on education, economics, politics, religion, traditionsand culture. I’m none of those. But I am a mother, and I will travel.” Whenshe saw a need somewhere in the world, she telephoned Christa Roth inGeneva, or their colleagues in New York: “Why not send me?”

For Audrey, the matter was simple: “Giving is living. If you stop wantingto give, there’s nothing more to live for.”

ON APRIL 22, 1991, the Film Society of Lincoln Center, New York, paidtribute to Audrey Hepburn. Excerpts from her films were screened, and therewere laudatory comments from some of her co-stars and directors. “I thinkit’s quite wonderful,” she said when she rose to speak after the prolongedapplause, “that this skinny broad could be turned into a marketablecommodity.”

“I never thought of myself as beautiful,” the skinny broad told aninterviewer at the time. “I’d like not to be so flat-chested. I’d like not to havesuch angular shoulders, such big feet, and such a big nose.” But then sheseemed embarrassed and said, “When you see what is happening in theworld, it’s so trivial to talk about looks. Actually, I’m very grateful for whatGod has given me. And there’s a lot more—so much more—that I must do!”Asked if she would like to make more movies, she replied, “It was fun oncebut it wouldn’t be fun now.” That season, as the tributes and awardcitations accumulated, Audrey was hailed as one of the finest actresses inAmerican film history.

But she was not an American actress. She never took Americancitizenship, she never owned a home in the United States, she was never amember of the American movie community. Like some of the great Europeanstars—perhaps most notably Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and IngridBergman—she worked for American companies. Garbo and Bergman hadmade films in Sweden before coming to America, and Dietrich was wellestablished in the German cinema, but Audrey was not known to Americanaudiences before Roman Holiday.

Although her accent was less pronounced than those European women, shehad a similar kind of understated European elegance and a slight air ofdetachment, which she used as an effectively alluring quality. Garbo andDietrich, whatever their talents, carefully calculated their public personae anddoled them out in morsels of meticulously controlled photographic andcinematic images: everything was for effect, and their stardom was perhapsvery much a matter of lighting. Both women eventually retreated into a kindof eremitical privacy, sad most of all because they deprived themselves ofany real human communion for a long time. Having presented themselves asif they had the motto “Nothing is as attractive as indifference,” they becamethe ultimate casualties of the remote illusions with which they so fullycooperated.

Bergman, on the other hand, was far more involved in the world and neverrelied on her beauty or her reputation to determine the variety of her roles.She had a more realistic approach to age, a far broader talent and a muchgreater range than Garbo or Dietrich, and her career extended so far that infifty years she mastered five languages (Swedish, German, English, Frenchand Italian) on stage, screen and television.

Garbo, Dietrich and Bergman were always and obviously European stars.Audrey, on the other hand, did not seem entirely European to Continentalaudiences; nor did she seem quite English to the British; in fact, she did notseem entirely anything, which may have been why writers relied on wordslike elf, gazelle, nymph, gamine, sprite and doe for their descriptions.Obviously she was a woman, or a girl-woman, but her sensuality was neitherflagrant nor exploited by herself or by her employers, and when at last shegot to make something like love on screen, some viewers shifted a trifleuneasily in their places. In a way, she was like Tinker Bell (James Barrie’s,not Walt Disney’s): her origins were shrouded in a kind of ethereal glow.

If her admirers considered Audrey’s career, they could count only elevenfilms made partly or completely in Hollywood—the remaining eighteen wereproduced in Europe, where she always felt more at home; she came to theUnited States only when she had to. That did not make her a European actressor a European woman in the eyes of most American critics and moviegoers,

who (whether they admitted it or not) wanted Audrey to be American. But inlife, if not always in art, she was in every way a European woman.

FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS beginning in early 1991, Audrey’s work for UNICEFwas primarily European fund-raising, but in September 1992, after repeatedrequests, she was finally permitted to visit Somalia—a country on the EastAfrican coast that was torn apart by civil war, drought, famine and politicalanarchy. Audrey, Rob and a small team from UNICEF landed in Mogadishuwithout visas, because there was no government. Nor were there roads, norany guarantee of safe passage, since killings for the smallest materials weredaily experiences. They found that the country had no electricity, no postalservice, no telephones—and almost no sustenance. “She insisted on seeingthe worst of the worst,” according to Madeline Eisner, who was on thatmission.

“The country is in total anarchy,” she said after her return. “There is noinfrastructure, and there have been four years of the most atrocious civil war.I thought I was prepared for what I saw, because I read the articles and sawpictures on television. But nothing can prepare you for the reality. What is anabstraction on the written page becomes a horrifying reality in person. Flyingin to Somalia, I saw hundreds and hundreds of graves around everysettlement and every village. Along the roads are dead animals, people likewalking phantoms—and children, thousands and tens of thousands of them,who are only just barely alive. They have little shacks made of a few twigs.Children are being snuffed out every day by starvation. They disappearslowly, with no energy to swat the flies that cluster on their faces and eyelids.There were huge trucks being loaded up with the bodies of children who haddied the night before.”

Audrey, Rob and a small team from UNICEF went to a feeding center inKismayo, then north to Mokomani and back to Mogadishu. From there, theywent across the southern border into Kenya.

“It was a living nightmare: there were these thin, thin, thin children of all

ages—small and just a little bit bigger—who to me seemed to have gonealready. And their eyes were like enormous pools of—of questioning. Theylook at you with such—I don’t quite know how to say this—as if they areasking, ‘Why?’ Some of the children have no light in their eyes. Most ofthem refuse food, because they are beyond wanting to eat or being able to eat.It is unacceptable to see children die right in front of your eyes. There werefifty-five thousand people in one refugee camp—half of them children,starving to death right before your eyes.”

She then spoke more frankly and with greater passion than ever, and sheopened her heart about the political situation.

“I am becoming more raw, more hurt, more angry, feeling the pain moredeeply. It’s really not to be believed how these people live, away from theirhomes in Somalia, and who knows when they can go back. The cattle aredead, the crops are gone. Families have lost their villages, their little homes.Most of all, they are losing their children every day.”

Asked to comment on the political situation, she was clear: “Politics bydefinition is supposed to be about people, for the welfare of people. I don’tbelieve in collective guilt, but I do believe in collective responsibility.Somalia is our responsibility. It’s certainly Britain’s responsibility and theItalians’ responsibility, because they colonized the country. And they shouldbe doing more—they have an obligation to those people from whom theybenefited for so many years.

“Humanitarian means human welfare and responding to human sufferingand that’s what politics should be, ideally. That’s what I dream about.Think about it—four hundred thousand Somalis are in refugee camps. Theyfled the war and hunger. And here—it’s as if they came here only to die—thisis really hell.”

She resumed her contact with the refugees, embracing babies and theirparents, encouraging children to take a little food that was available—but thechildren could no longer eat. “I saw a little boy, rail-thin, just sitting with abit of cloth around him—he was just bones and eyes, and he was struggling

for breath. He obviously had a respiratory infection. I just wished I couldbreathe for him, but while I was there, he lay down—and then he was gone.”

And with that description of just one child’s death, Audrey could no longerreport the awfulness of it all. She broke down and wept.

“She generated hope and goodwill with dignity and compassion,” saidMartha Hyer Wallis, her friend from the time of Sabrina. “She gave so muchof herself to so many people.”

RETURNING TO TOLOCHENAZ in mid-October after press conferences inLondon to discuss their African journey, Audrey and Rob hoped for a fewweeks of rest before proceeding for UNICEF activities in California, but shewas feeling unwell, with stomach pains, indigestion and a colicky abdominaltenderness. Local doctors could not determine a specific cause, and Audreypresumed her indisposition was due to a virus or bacteria she had contractedin Africa. She was put on a regimen of metronidazole, an antibiotic that isoften effective against parasitic infections; unfortunately, this powerfulmedication can have unpleasant side effects, and Audrey suffered badly fromthem—nausea, violent diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy, or tingling in thehands and feet.

Her condition worsened, despite the drugs. She then decided to have testsin Los Angeles before resuming her work there. “Etiology unknown” was thefirst report: the source of her infirmity could not be determined. One of herphysicians recommended that Audrey enter Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fora laparoscopy, a surgical examination of the interior of the abdomen andpelvis. The procedure was performed on November 1, and it revealed awidespread cancer that had begun in the appendix and enveloped her colon.A partial colectomy was performed, and Audrey was placed on intravenousfeedings, with no normal ingestion of food or drink permitted. When herelder son informed her of the diagnosis and procedure, she was not surprisedand remarkably calm.

In the last week of November, Audrey began the first round ofchemotherapy, which she tolerated well. Recovering at the home of a friendin Beverly Hills, she was briefly optimistic—until she was overcome bysudden and severe abdominal pain, the sign of a bowel obstruction.Frightened but composed, she returned to Cedars-Sinai. On December 1, asecond surgery was performed, but her disease had spread so widely that itwas beyond remedy.

When she emerged from anesthesia, Sean told his mother that the interiorincisions were too “irritated” from the previous surgery to operate again.“Neither the boys nor I could acknowledge that she was dying,” RobertWolders said later with admirable candor. “We perhaps made a mistake innot telling her how ill she was. I think that was very unfair to her, becauseAudrey was as realistic about death as she was about life. When she began tosense that she was dying, she made us promise that we would let her go whenit was time. We promised, but I don’t think we followed through.”

She wanted desperately to go home to Tolochenaz for Christmas, butdoctors warned that a routine commercial flight could be disastrous in herfrail condition; still fed intravenously, she now required a morphine pump tocontrol the agonizing pain. When he heard the details, Givenchy arranged fora private jet to collect Audrey, Sean, Rob, a nurse and the dogs and to bringthem to Switzerland. They departed Los Angeles on December 19 andarrived home next afternoon. Still unable to take anything by mouth, Audreyremained in bed for most of the holiday. For all that, she insisted it was thebest Christmas in her life, for she was surrounded by undiluted love.

“My one wish for Christmas would be peace,” she had said. “Peaceespecially for the children of the world. Only then will the water we providequench their thirst, the food nourish their bodies, the medicine make themwell—and only then will they live to play and learn, and their parents willlive to love them.”

A few close friends were invited for the holiday, Christa Roth amongthem. “Frail though she was,” Christa recalled, “she took a basket anddistributed little presents to everyone, personal mementos. She gave me a

black-and-white Givenchy scarf.” Givenchy arrived, too, and Audrey askedRob to take down a coat from a closet. “Take the blue one, Hubert,” she saidin a barely audible voice, “because blue’s your color.” She took the coat,kissed it and held it out to her friend. “I hope you will keep this coat all yourlife.” On his flight to Paris that evening, Hubert de Givenchy, wiping awaytears, kept the coat around his shoulders.

The days at La Paisible were cold but sunny. Despite the intrusivepaparazzi, buzzing in their helicopters above La Paisible like vultures,Audrey insisted on trying to walk a bit each day around her beloved gardens,pointing out to Sean or Rob or the housekeeper which plants or trees wouldrequire special care. Wrapped in a sweater and down coat, she sat and inhaledthe winter air, raising her head toward the sunlight and whispering, “Mmmm—delicious.”

On Sunday, January 17, 1993, she made her last effort. “Oh,” shewhispered, “I am just so tired.”

Over the following two days, Audrey slept intermittently. As she slipped inand out of consciousness, she said several times, to whomever was at herbedside, “They are expecting me…the Amish people…the angels…they arewaiting for me…working in the fields.” To Luca, she said, “I’m sorry, butI’m ready to go.”

“My life has been so much more than a fairy tale,” Audrey had said adozen years earlier. “I’ve had my share of difficult moments, but it’s as ifthere was always a light at the end of the tunnel.”

On Wednesday, January 20, the minister who had officiated at Audrey’smarriage to Mel was summoned; later, Mel arrived, too, as did Andrea. Lucawas there with Sean, and the house staff, and a nurse. After some quietprayers at Audrey’s bedside, everyone left the room. Christa Roth thenarrived for a brief visit and remained with her. Audrey was dozing,apparently without pain.

EXCEPT FOR TWO SCRIPTS and her Oscar statuette, Audrey Hepburn kept norelics from her career, but she did have boxes and albums full of photos thattold the story of a remarkable life.

There was the seven-year-old Audrey Ruston, gazing serenely in her firstpassport photo, her dark hair cut short and straight, with a stylish swatch ofbangs strategically combed by her mother. And there she was at nine, withthe cool and elegant baroness. Her father’s photo, yellowed and creased,showed him holding her hand tentatively, a distracted look clouding hisfeatures.

In other snapshots, she could be recognized as a rambunctious teenager,suddenly reed tall and lean, an apprentice dancer waiting to leap into anystory—and then she was a leggy chorine, high-stepping onto the Londonmusical stage. There was a tender image of her leaning on the ample bosomof Colette, who was reading aloud from Jacques Porel’s Fils de Réjane. Andof course, there were photos of Audrey as Gigi, wide-eyed and innocent, butdetermined that she could not be bought, thank you. Photos of Princess Ann,variously elegant and playful during her Roman holiday, were neatlyarranged with production stills from Sabrina, in which she had worn her firstGivenchy wardrobe. In her working script for Funny Face, there were snapsof Audrey, all in black but for the dramatic white socks, bounding joyfully inher mod-expressive dance. And in the pages of her My Fair Lady script wereher notes: how to make the character come to life, how to make everythingbetter.

There, too, were the first wedding photos—the golden girl, with thechaplet of flowers, and her handsome, protective groom. And there was thegreat cache of glossies of her boys, albums that documented their lives fromthe cradle…and Audrey with Andrea, both of them trying against all odds…

But most of all, there were the dozens of still photos from The Nun’s Story,the role and the film that gave her a lifetime of precious friendships and thatforever altered something in her life—precisely what that was, she could notsay at the time, but as she had written to Marie Louise Habets and KathrynHulme, the experience of making that film had thrust down very deep roots

that might take years to flourish:

“All I can tell you is that any resemblance between the present Hepburnand the former one is purely accidental. I have seen and learned so much andhave been so enriched by a milliard experiences that I am and feel a differentperson.” In that letter, written twenty-five years before she lay dying, Audreyhad written of the hardships of working in Africa, which provided her withmemories from which she hoped to be enriched for years to come. “Delvinginto the heart and mind of Sister Luke, I have also had to dig deep down inmyself…The seeds of all I have experienced have fallen on neatly preparedground, and I hope will result in harvesting a better Audrey.”

Years later, those who worked with her at UNICEF, and those who felt thebreadth of her caring, her compassion and her effective work in Africa andaround the world, knew firsthand the result of that harvest. The circle hadclosed; art had been enfolded into the core of her being. As she onceexclaimed about her garden in full flower, so it could now at last be said ofher own life: “It is all so impossibly—so wonderfully—exquisite.”

INSIDE LA PAISIBLE, all was quiet as Audrey’s sons, Robert Wolders and a fewothers tried valiantly to maintain their composure. They were about to goback upstairs, to bid a last farewell to Audrey as she lay sleeping. ThenChrista summoned them, and when they entered the room, everything wasstill and peaceful. All traces of suffering had vanished and there was, aseveryone recalled, the same indelible smile on her lips that they had knownso well over the years. As Audrey had said, she was ready, and the otherswere waiting for her.

The Art of Alfred Hitchcock

*1 The admirable Italian actress Valentina Cortese worked in Britain andAmerica for a time in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when she wassometimes billed as Valentina Cortesa, as she was in this film. But her truename, which she much preferred, is used here.

*2 When the film was released in 1953, Trumbo’s name was omitted: he hadbeen blacklisted in the notorious anti-Communist hysteria of the time. IanMcLellan Hunter “fronted” for Trumbo as creator of the story and secretlyshared a portion of the screenwriting income with him. When the picture wonAcademy Awards for best story and for best screenplay, the statuettes werepresented to Hunter (for story) and to Hunter and John Dighton (forscreenplay), which is how the screen credit then appeared. The Academy ofMotion Picture Arts and Sciences rectified the matter forty years later, andthe Oscar was posthumously presented to Trumbo in 1993. Since then thererelease prints of Roman Holiday carry the credit: “Screenplay by IanMcLellan Hunter and John DightonStory by Dalton Trumbo.”

*3  In Rome, Alberto De Rossi eventually made strategic makeup changes dueto the circumstances of lighting, weather and other contingencies. He sopleased Audrey that she asked for him on five of her subsequent Europeanfilms; his wife, Grazia De Rossi, styled Audrey’s hair for four of them.

*4 Taylor’s title was drawn from no less a source than

John Milton, whose seventeenth-century poem Comusaddressed the goddess of England’s Severn River(hence its Latin name, Sabrina):

Sabrina fair,

Listen where thou art sitting

Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,

In twisted braids of lilies knitting

The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;

Listen for dear honour’s sake,

Goddess of the silver lake,

Listen and save!

*5 The La Jolla Playhouse was revived in 1983 on the campus of theUniversity of California at San Diego, where it is a thriving and award-winning regional theater company.

*6 After Sabrina, Givenchy designed Audrey’s wardrobe for Funny Face,Love in the Afternoon, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Charade, ParisWhen It Sizzlesand How to Steal a Million. In 1954, he made a fittings mannequin that wasunchanged for the rest of her life.

*7 Audrey had briefly been represented by Lew Wasserman at MCA, but shepreferred a smaller agency with a European sensibility.

*8 The ageless Cary Grant, in Charade, was the egregious exception: thetwenty-five-year age difference seemed not to matter.

*10 Lou and Kate lived together for more than thirty-five years, sharing astrong and unsentimental Catholic faith and an unwavering commitment tohuman welfare. “My neighbors say that I am still a nun,” wrote Lou to theauthor of this book in 1984, three years after Kate died at eighty-one, in1981; Lou died a decade later at eighty-six; her double name, Marie Louise,did not have the hyphen habitually and incorrectly added by others.

*11 Audrey requested and was given as her dresser a woman she hadbefriended named Adelia Buonis, who had performed the same functionduring War and Peace. She also asked that her former assistant, CarloPierfederici, be her driver during the filming of The Nun’s Story. “He needsthe work and he is a gem,” she wrote to Henry Blanke.

*12 Audrey, her director and many who contributed to the film were awardedprizes worldwide, but Oscars eluded them; she did, however, receive tophonors in 1959 from the British Film Academy and the New York FilmCritics Circle. That was the year of Ben-Hur, which, perhaps to no one’ssurprise, won eleven Academy Awards: a traditional Hollywood “religious”movie, it was burdened with mere spectacle and self-conscious pieties, and itlacked the depths of Zinnemann’s filmnone of which seemed to matter in thevoting. Simone Signoret was voted Best Actress for her performance in Roomat the Top.

*14 The discrepancies between this account of Audrey’s planned participationand that given in my book The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of AlfredHitchcock (1983) are explained by the fact that, in 2004, previouslyunreleased details concerning No Bail for the Judge were at last madeavailable to the public from the Paramount archives.

$\ast _ { 2 1 }$ The film was based on a novel by the popular writer Sidney Sheldon.Evidently he and Paramount believed that his own name in the title wouldsell tickets, and so it was released as Sidney Sheldon’s Bloodline.
