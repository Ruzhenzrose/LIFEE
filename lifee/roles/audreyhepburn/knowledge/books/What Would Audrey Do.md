About the Author

# Introduction

Audrey Hepburn came to the attention of most Americans in September1953, when she got above-the-title billing as Princess Ann in Roman Holiday— capturing the heart of her costar, Gregory Peck, as well as a generation ofmoviegoers who wondered: Who is that young woman? Her name, we soonlearned, was Audrey Kathleen Hepburn-Ruston, she was the daughter of abaroness, and within weeks of the film’s release her gamine style, hersingular offscreen fashion sense, and even her haircut were copied by ageneration of women throughout the world.

At a time when the prevailing notion of the acceptable way for women todress was highly sexual, with a very obvious silhouette of large breasts, a tinywaist beneath a full skirt, and mincing heels, by her example, Audrey offeredanother way for women to dress, behave, aspire to, and even be.

And almost fifty-five years since we first saw Roman Holiday, Audrey isstill showing us how it’s done. As a style icon, her influence is unrivaled. In2006, New Woman magazine voted her the Most Beautiful Woman of AllTime. On Seventh Avenue, in Hollywood, in the halls of Vogue, Peoplemagazine, or InStyle, to describe something (or someone) as “very Audrey” isshorthand for the absolute height of chic.

Today, fashion designers are the new rock stars. On television, shows likeAmerica’s Next Top Model and Project Runway attempt to demystify thefashion world, and not an awards show goes by without stars being asked:“What are you wearing?”

But Audrey was—and still is—the first. Every fall or spring, it seems,another designer mimics the clean lines of her crisp white shirt, the littleblack dress, or beautifully fitted Givenchy-esque suit. Often without realizingit, the best dressed among us are still reveling in the lessons Audrey taught.

When you see someone wearing oversized sunglasses with an eveninggown, that’s not original—that’s Audrey. Ballet flats outside of a dancestudio? Audrey was the first. The straight line of a black sweater and fittedblack trousers that every fashion editor in the world seems to favor? Waybefore Prada had fashionistas dressing like they were en route to a beatnikfuneral, Audrey was appearing that way— quite radically for the time—in themid 1950s.

But the way she dressed was almost the least of what makes Audrey cool.Decorator Jeffrey Bilhuber, who has worked with some of the most stylishwomen of our time, believes that Audrey is still so compelling today becauseof who she was: “Audrey never systematically schemed to become a star—she had stardom within her . . . it didn’t have to be created or manufactured.It was always there. She would have been as admirable a math teacher as shewould have been a movie star, because she was predestined for greatness— 一she was what she was.”

Her cultural influence is still so iconic that in September 2006, Gapunveiled the Audrey Hepburn™ Pant to Middle America (much to thechagrin of many of her fans—“nothing less than a travesty,” said one fashionblogger—and her more proper Hollywood friends) with a television ad thatfeatured a computer-generated Hepburn dancing to the very non-AudreyAC/DC’s “Back in Black.” The fact that the campaign was okayed by hersons Sean Ferrer and Luca Dotti, that Gap made a generous donation to theAudrey Hepburn Children’s Fund, mollified few people. “They also made herlook much thinner than she was in real life,” complained a close friend ofAudrey’s.

As to whether Audrey would or would not have sold herself out like that,the jury is still undecided—had her first marriage to Mel Ferrer not imploded,he might have tried to broker some kind of a deal. But those who knewAudrey knew (as Cary Grant did) that “in spite of her fragile appearance,she’s like steel,” and doubt she ever would have allowed anything so crasslycommercial to occur under her name or image. On the other hand, they knowshe would have done practically anything to help promote the good work ofUNICEF.

Audrey was the first celebrity of her stature to use her fame to help othersand, beyond that, to help those whom most people did not care about, orbarely thought of. Especially today, when the prevailing notion of celebrity ispure ego satisfaction—“I am famous, therefore I am [and therefore: you oweme]”—and the bar for being considered famous is sinking lower and lower(appearing on a reality television show, being picked up for DUI, having ablog), Audrey could be considered quite radical because she used her famefor something other than her own personal gain.

As Robert Wolders, her companion and spouse in everything but name andher partner during the happiest years of her life, observed, “Audrey sensed at

a very early age that fame or stardom doesn’t mean that much. So she made aconscious decision within herself—she was very realistic, and aware that shehad to do something with this notoriety, this attention she was getting.Something to help others, if she could. And this was something that she wasborn with.”

Today, Audrey’s sentiment is increasingly prevalent among the moreenlightened celebrities. As Matt Damon recently observed of fame, “I thinkit’s incumbent on us to do as much good as you can within the sphere ofinfluence that you have. Otherwise, it’s just a waste of resources.”

But before George Clooney and Angelina Jolie, even before OprahWinfrey was doing so, Audrey and Rob were flying in little planes to some ofthe most desolate places on earth—Ethiopia, El Salvador and Nicaragua,Sudan, Bangladesh, and finally, Somalia, the one that broke her heart.

Another more interesting question might be: Why, more than fifty yearsafter Roman Holiday was released, is Audrey Hepburn still being held up as astyle (and in our opinion life) icon? Since we first met Audrey in 1953, andafter her untimely death in 1993, she has rarely been off the cultural radar.Robert Wolders thinks the answer is simple (although mildly depressing inthe society we find ourselves in today): No one has taken her place.

Oh sure, there have been a few pretenders to the throne (JacquelineKennedy Onassis, Grace Kelly, Sofia Coppola), but really, has anyone, couldanyone, replace Audrey? We’re going to go out on a limb here and say no.But rather than get depressed over this (and the fact that we shall never, inthis lifetime and quite possibly the next, be able to eat all the carbs we wantand never gain weight), let’s study Audrey’s life lessons and learn what wecan from her.

As a woman of her influence and stature, Audrey has had dozens of bookswritten about her. Although her face and the on-screen characters she createdare famous, there is still much we don’t know about Audrey.

Yes, she had a twenty-inch waist that an early Hollywood PR man insistedon encircling in a dog collar as a publicity stunt and having a photographertake a picture of. Hubert de Givenchy remained her friend for life, and wasthe executor of her estate. Although renowned for her mesmerizing eyes, shedid not wear makeup at home. She knew how to iron. She was handy andcould fix things. She did not like to drive. Her two divorces almost killed her.She had trouble gaining weight and enjoyed eating bowls of pasta.

And in case you’re wondering—she was not an American, and not evendistantly related to Katharine Hepburn.

She smoked two—and occasionally three—packs of cigarettes a day herentire adult life, yet had such personal self-discipline that she could eat asquare of dark baking chocolate and stop at that. Winner of two Oscars (oneposthumously), she was nominated four times and was one of the few peopleto win an Oscar, a Tony, an Emmy, and a Grammy. But Audrey’s real dreamwas to be a wife and mother. “Even when I was a little girl,” she said, “what Iwanted most was to have a child. That was always the real me. The movieswere fairy tales.”

In spite of her memorable, beautiful visage, Audrey did not considerherself attractive. Rob Wolders thought “she was like a child that refused tobelieve how good she looked.” But her friend Audrey Wilder said she musthave had some sense of her influence on modern twentieth- and now twenty-first-century fashion. “When she saw so many copies of herself walkingdown the street, how could she not?” she observed rightly.

But let’s not kid ourselves, there are ways that AH was like us, and waysthat she was way better that we are. Yes, she was born with great beauty, anenviable bone structure, and a manner that made practically everyone she metfall instantly in love with her. She also rarely exercised, ate whatever shewanted, enjoyed a Scotch in the evening, and remained an enviable 110pounds her entire adult life.

(How did she do it? Don’t worry, we’ll get to that.)

On the other hand—and this is where the real lessons begin for us—herpersonal life was not the cakewalk she wanted the world to believe it was. Inreality, her experience was full of tremendous heartbreak. (“Until Rob, shejust didn’t have much luck in the man department, did she?” said DominickDunne, a friend.) There were miscarriages, personal betrayals, loneliness, andunfaithful husbands. Still she kept going.

And truth be told, she was not St. Audrey (a term she detested), nor thesimple, ethereal princess that Gregory Peck fell in love with.

Life, wrote the seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, is“nasty, brutish, and short.” Wow. And this was before the invention of CNN,BlackBerry addiction, and Internet dating. Today, politicians (granted, not themost stylish group at any level) are at one another’s throats. The stock marketis up, or it is down. Etiquette (basic or otherwise) is at an all-time low. Even

the people we traditionally look to for fun-loving advice—the Hollywoodstarlet or her East Coast counterpart, the socialite—are too busy doing a perpwalk, checking into Promises, popping Adderall, or neglecting to wearlingerie in public to be of much help to us.

Who, then, can we turn to?

In the beginning of the twenty-first century (much as we did for most ofthe twentieth century), we look to Miss Audrey for advice. For consolation.For encouragement. For answering the inevitable question: What the heck amI going to wear today?

What follows, then, in one handy volume, is the full Audrey Primer. Frombeginner lessons (Iron your shirt! Stand up straight!) through the advanced(getting out of that marriage without losing your mind), What Would AudreyDo? will show you how to navigate both the shoals and the high points ofyour life.

WWAD? is not another Hepburn biography, but a primer in what we canlearn—today—from Audrey’s life lessons. There is Audrey’s beauty andstyle, obviously, but also how to run your life, how to rebound after a brutaldivorce. Two brutal divorces. We also explore her interior life, her sensitivity—this is what made her a great actress, after all, but also made her intenselyvulnerable to the slights of the world, and Hollywood is a notoriously toughtown. How did she keep going?

“Audrey was such a regular, down to earth person, that when I read someof what people write about her, I don’t recognize her,” says Rob Wolders.With close to ten years of research, interviews with Audrey’s friends, family,and those she loved, as well as access to new sources of information,WWAD? is the ultimate Audrey go-to guide.

For those of you who don’t know your history—and really, whatAmericans do?—we’ve got enough biographical information here to satisfythe most devoted Audrey fan. Audrey’s place in pop culture? Her role as acultural icon? How she influences designers and style icons today? Allcovered. Dating tips from Audrey? Got it. How to get some Audrey Style foryourself? We’ve got it right here. In short, how to make your way through thevagaries of your own life by using AH’s experiences as an example. Soinstead of merely considering Audrey as a style icon (a simple enough thing),we are going to study the underpinnings of her life as philosophicalguideposts for decisions we make in our own lives.

Because face it, while we might not have Audrey’s enviable figure (heck,we know we don’t), there are still so many lessons we can learn from her.How to overcome adversity. How to create the life that you want. How to bea fashion icon in your own corner of the world. (And forget what Hollywoodtells you—size has almost nothing to do with it.)

Think of this book as Audrey 2.0, because like Audrey herself, WWAD? isa Zen koan with a soupçon of style thrown in. And because frankly, while sheplayed both a princess and a Givenchy-clad call girl with equal aplomb on-screen, the real Audrey was smarter, tougher (at times), funnier, strongerwilled, more vulnerable, earthier, and far more worldly than the public eitherknew or imagined.

And someday—whether you are a precocious eighth grader, a sorority gal,out in the world and working, dating three guys at once, a stay-at-home mom,or an Oscar-winning actress with a few style issues of your own—you willthank us for lifting the curtain on All Things Audrey. Because really, don’tyou think we could all use some Audrey in our lives, right now?

# chapter 1

# Audrey as Movie Star

“I Worked my ass off.”

—AH

Audrey Hepburn was a movie Star.

It is almost as if the gods had smiled down and chosen her. By the age oftwenty-five she had survived the Nazis, almost starved to death, kissedGregory Peck, met Givenchy, been scared as hell, won an Oscar, won aTony, been engaged, been alone, grown up without her father, beendiscovered by William Wyler, charmed Colette, posed for a soap ad inLondon, and been on the cover of Time magazine (when appearing on thecover of Time meant something).

In short: She was not like us. Because no matter how much they wanderaround with their T-shirts and Starbucks coffee cups, their sunglasses andbaseball caps, movie stars are not like us, they are not meant to be—they are“us” writ large: the us we wish we could be. Like all great women (and men),history smiles down upon them. As the Greeks, successful presidentialcandidates, and Madison Avenue know: If we did not have heroes, we wouldcreate them.

“She struck me as being very alert, very smart, very talented, veryambitious.”—William Wyler, upon meeting AH in 1951

# BEFORE SHE WAS A STAR

Before they get discovered, some stars land a soap opera gig, like DemiMoore and Alec Baldwin, others walk down Hollywood Boulevard in achicken suit handing out flyers for a local Mexican restaurant, as did BradPitt. Although she was—honestly—practically an overnight success, here isAudrey’s verbatim account to powerful Hollywood columnist HeddaHopper1of (some of) what she did in London’s West End before her bigbreak.

“In London I did High Button Shoes twice nightly for three years. That wastwelve times a week, plus ballet classes. Then I did another show twelvetimes weekly. While in this show, the same producer, Cecil Landeau, wantedto do cabaret. He said anybody who’d like to make an extra shilling could bein it. After the show at 11:30 at night, I would go to Ciro’s by 12:00, makeup, and do another show. All dancing. I would get home by 2:00. I madeeleven pounds in the first show; and twenty pounds in the second. So I wasdoing eighteen shows weekly and earning in American dollars $\$ 150$ a week. Iwas completely nuts. The same producer was a very ambitious man—hedecided to do a Christmas show in pantomime for children. He called itChristmas Party. He asked if we would like to do it. There were four girlsand we said, ‘Let’s.’ I must say I was the only one to stay after a week ofrehearsals. I would get home by 2:00, eat, and go to sleep. At 10:00 a.m. Iwould be in rehearsal. I was very ambitious and took every opportunity. Iwanted to learn and I wanted to be seen.”

In spite of her ethereal aura, Audrey’s work ethic was formidable. At thisearly stage of her career, she was doing twenty-one shows a week inLondon’s West End, and even took on a Christmas show to get (as she put it)“a big fat pay packet.” Then, she appeared in the chorus of a light musical,Sauce Piquant (and was paid fifteen pounds a week). “An extraordinary thingfor me,” she recalled. “I was a girl in the chorus but the critics singled me out. . . [I] was astounded to see my name mentioned.”

Some of her cast mates were less than thrilled. “I can’t stand it,”complained a more voluptuous dancer, Aud Johanssen. “I’ve got the best titson stage, and yet they’re all staring at a girl who hasn’t got any.”

In September 1951, Audrey’s luck was about to change even more whenshe did a screen test at Pinewood Studios in London for a movie calledRoman Holiday. The director, William Wyler, said that he was looking for agirl without an American accent, someone you could believe might actuallybe a princess. They had been looking on two continents, auditioningthousands of would-be Princess Anns, but without success.

Wyler didn’t feel like sticking around and conducting the tests himself, sohe chose a few girls to be tested for the lead female role and put ThoroldDickinson in charge.

Dickinson had worked with Audrey before in a small British film calledThe Secret People, so he knew what she was capable of. For the test, they did

a few scenes from Roman Holiday, but since Paramount wanted to see whatshe was like as a person, he loaded a camera with a thousand feet of film andjust let it roll—getting Audrey to speak about the war, the Allied raid onArnhem, and hiding out in a cellar. It was “a deeply moving thing,” herecalled.

At Wyler’s request, the camera kept rolling, and someone told Audrey shecould leave. She stayed put. “I didn’t hear anybody say ‘Cut!’ ” she said.“Only one man here has the right to say ‘Cut’ and I won’t move until I hearhim.”

“Cut!” said Dickinson. But the camera kept rolling as Audrey sat up in herroyal bed, stretched sexily, clasped her hands behind her knees, smiled, andasked how she’d done.

When the results were flown to Wyler in Rome, he found them irresistible.“She had everything I was looking for—charm, innocence, and talent. Shewas also very funny. She was absolutely enchanting, and we said, ‘That’s thegirl.’”

The studio fired off a cable to Richard Mealand, their representative inLondon: “Exercise the option on this lady. The test is certainly one of the bestever made in Hollywood, New York or London.”

# AUDREY: THE BACKSTORY

Audrey Hepburn was born Edda Kathleen van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston inBrussels on May 4, 1929. Her mother was a Dutch baroness whose ownaspirations of becoming an actress and opera singer were discounted by herfamily because of their place in society. “When I was younger,” she oncesaid, “I wanted to be thin, beautiful, and an actress, now isn’t it ironic that Ihave a daughter who’s all three?”

Audrey’s father, Joseph Hepburn-Ruston, was a charming Anglo-Irishbusinessman with strong Nazi inclinations. The Hepburn-Rustons had adifficult marriage, made worse by Joseph’s support of Hitler, his alcoholabuse, and his eventual decision to channel some of his in-laws’ wealthtoward fascist causes.

It is said that Audrey, always a sensitive child, hid under the dining roomtable when her parents argued.

In May 1935, Ruston did the unthinkable: He walked out on his wife andsix-year-old daughter on the eve of World War II, leaving them to fend forthemselves. The loss of Audrey’s father haunted Audrey well into adulthoodand her two failed marriages. She considered her father’s disappearance “themost traumatic event in my life” and remembered that her mother’s hairturned white overnight.

As an adult, Audrey rarely spoke to the press of her childhood or herfather. “There was a great deal of pain involved, because, before the war heleft us,” she recalled. “My mother explained very sweetly that he’d gone on atrip and she didn’t think he was coming back. I was terribly jealous of otherlittle girls who did have adoring daddies, and all that.”

Talk show host Phil Donohue, in a 1990 interview, asked Audrey if livingunder the Nazis made her insecure. “That is not what made me insecure,” shesaid. “My father leaving us is what left me insecure. It stayed with methrough my own relationships. When I fell in love and got married, I lived inconstant fear of being left. . . .”

Despite her father’s disappearance, there was joy in young Audrey’s life.Growing up in the Dutch town of Arnhem during World War II, she hadalways loved ballet, which she began studying at the age of eleven. Dancewas an escape for Audrey, an attempt to find beauty in an unkind world. Aschaotic as the war years were, she always continued with her lessons. It gavea center to her world. In fact, she gathered up the neighborhood children andgave them lessons at her grandfather’s home, installing a barre in his largeentrance hall with its black and white marble floor. “I gave classes for allages,” she remembered. “I accepted what was about a dime a lesson. Weworked to a gramophone wound by hand.”

By 1944, as the Germans marched across Europe, Audrey was dancingendless hours in shoes that were worn to shreds but impossible to replace.Finally, she resorted to the only, painful, alternative— wooden ones.

But even the rigorous beauty of ballet could not keep reality at bay. Hermother’s family, the van Heemstras, were rumored to be part Jewish, and afavorite uncle and cousin were executed as enemies of the Third Reich.Occupying forces confiscated Audrey’s ancestral home and bank accounts.Though just a child, she distributed anti-Nazi literature during the war andbarely escaped capture by the Germans.

Even while playing the princess in Hollywood, Audrey never forgot the

suffering she and others endured under the Nazis. At fifteen, she was inHolland during “the hunger winter”—the last winter of the war, 1944-45,where so many died of starvation and a tuberculosis epidemic that there was ashortage of caskets. She ate tulip bulbs and tried to make bread from grass.Many days she only had water to drink, and drank a great deal of it in orderto feel full, or went to bed in the afternoon in order to conserve her strength.

By the time Holland was liberated, Audrey was five feet six, weighedninety pounds, and was afflicted with anemia, asthma, jaundice, and otherdiseases stemming from poor diet. Having suffered from varying degrees ofmalnutrition from the age of eleven through sixteen, Audrey’s metabolismwould always be affected by her traumatic adolescence. As an adult, shestruggled, always, to keep weight on. While her famous gamine figure wouldbecome celebrated in the coming years, it was, in fact, a combination ofgenes (she had the exact same figure as her father’s mother) and tragiccircumstance.

# Audrey’s Actors Studio Moment

Audrey never took a single acting lesson in her life. But for all of youactors/models/spokespeople who wonder “How the heck did she dothat?”—meaning: Be such an incredible actress?—here is AH ontechnique. . . .

After Hedda Hopper asked her, “How do you conceive of a part youplay?” Audrey responded, “Something happens in you. When you reada book, you make your own interpretation of the characters . . . when Ifirst read a book I see them. It happens very clearly.”

Audrey had never had formal training. She studied dance before shedid films, and had voice lessons before her Gigi appearance onBroadway, to help her voice project beyond the first few rows. Butbeyond that, it was pure instinct. Or very good natural ability.

“God kissed her on the cheek, and there she was,” said Billy Wilder.

In the Exceptionally Lucky Break Department, Audrey and famedHollywood photographer Bob Willoughby met one morning in March 1953,after he got a call from his agent asking him to go over to Paramount to coverthe publicity shoot of a young ingénue who had just created a big impressionwith her role in William Wyler’s soon-to-be-released film Roman Holiday.

Ah—these starlets! They were generally very nice and sincere, and waitingfor their big break, like everyone else in L.A., but Bob was hoping for moreimportant assignments. After all, he was twenty-five years old and alreadyshooting for Harper’s Bazaar and Look.

Bob was ambitious. He wanted to see the world, move on to bigger things,maybe head to Paris, do some artsy stuff. But, his agent reminded him, it wasthese assignments, usually for fan magazines— the precursors of Us Weeklyand People and InStyle—that kept him in food, film, and darkroomequipment.

“Bob—you’re poor and you need money and get your ass over there,” hisagent said bluntly, as any good ten-percenter should.

So Willoughby packed up his cameras and headed over to the StillsGallery on the lot. There, he caught up with Bud Fraker, the head portraitphotographer.

While waiting for their subject, a vision floated out of the dressing room.Fraker caught Bob’s eye—“She’s something, isn’t she?”

Bob was so taken aback at her beauty that his jaw practically hit the floor.

Yes.

So that explained why Paramount was going all out with the phalanx ofpublicists and makeup and wardrobe people; even the studio’s head designer,Edith Head, was there. Obviously, this entire setup was a big deal. Thisyoung woman—whoever she was—was not just another hungry nobody fromthe Midwest with a ninth-grade education and perfect skin. Bud set up behindthe huge eight-by-ten studio portrait camera as Bob sorted out his own shots.

It was only during a break in shooting that someone thought to introducethem: “Bob, this is Audrey Hepburn.”

Miss Hepburn, just a year younger than Bob, took his hand and smiledwith an energy fated to melt men’s hearts. Like almost everyone else whomet Audrey, Bob practically fell in love with her on the spot. His earlyapathy turned to enthusiasm. It was only later, after seeing Roman Holiday,that he realized she really was the princess she portrayed.

Bob went home that night and tried to describe Audrey to his mother, but itwas hard to convey her magic.

He had met the most unique young woman today. . . . “She’s in a movie,Roman Holiday, with Greg Peck. She plays a princess, and word on the lot isthat Peck insisted she get top billing alongside him—otherwise, he told hisagent, he’s going to look like an idiot. And she’s a complete unknown!”

Wait, he told his mother, wait. “Let me develop the prints and you’ll seewhat I mean.” It was hard to put it into words, but he had a feeling thatknowing this girl would change his life.

Whatever it was, she had it.

# Audrey and Stardom: What Was It?

When Audrey first graced the screen as the princess in RomanHoliday, her early life was far more harrowing than she let on, and shewas also a good deal more ambitious—and strong willed—than sheappeared. Below, some star setting tips for everyone.

# Rule No. 1: Be Memorable

As a star, or even as an unforgettable person making your way in theworld, you do not want to be like everyone else.

Even at a young age, Audrey knew what worked for her and whatdidn’t. She had a very strong vision of her place in the world and, inthis sense, was very much like a princess. Robert Wolders observed,“She was secure in her values and early on found a level where she feltand functioned best. Her personal style was a result of herunwillingness to compromise on those values and to focus on what isbasic and real. She showed a good deal of stubbornness toward outsideinfluences, always insisting on what felt natural and comfortable.

“Her sense of appropriateness and decorum was happily mixed witha sense of irony and humor—not taking yourself too seriously, butseriously enough.”

# Rule No. 2: Be Modest

It sounds like an oxymoron, doesn’t it? Stand out in the crowd and be

modest. But in addition to her will and ambition (and a talent that shewas perhaps only beginning to recognize), Audrey had a very realmodesty that was encouraged by her upbringing. A modesty that wasrare to come by—and not at all encouraged in Hollywood. Herprofessional ascent was swift and decisive, and she had a great deal tobrag about. In the following year she would win a Tony Award forOndine, a play she was performing on Broadway, and both an Oscarand a Golden Globe Award for Roman Holiday.

Still, Audrey never forgot where she came from. This core ofcertainty was one of her strengths. Years later, she would remembersomething her mother said to her—“ ‘Considering that you have notalent, it’s really extraordinary where you’ve got.’ She said it in themiddle of all the lovely successes I was having. She wasn’t putting medown,” Audrey reasoned. “She was saying how fortunate I was.”

# Rule No. 3: Maintain a Sense of Wonder About Your Life and theWorld

Having survived World War II and then landed in Hollywood, Audreywas lucky as hell, and she knew it. One might ask, did she have anysense of what the impact of Roman Holiday might be when she madeit?

“Not at all,” said Audrey, “I had no sense, period! I was awfully newand awfully young to be doing my first movie, and thrilled to be doingit. But I was not even aware of the significance of doing a picture withWilliam Wyler—who William Wyler really was. . . . He came toEngland, looking for an unknown for the picture, which in fact was myonly qualification.”

On some level, though, she knew that her life was about to change.Audrey’s response when she learned of Paramount’s decision to casther as the lead in Roman Holiday was touching in its simplicity: “Lord,help me live up to all of this.”

Modest. Extremely talented. Strong willed. Shy. Beautiful. Disciplined.Hidden. Audrey was all of these things and more. “The test of a firstrate intelligence,” wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald, “is the ability to hold twoopposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability tofunction.” Maybe these conflicting dichotomies are what made Audrey

# BE A MOVIE STAR IN YOUR OWN LIFE

While you might not be discovered by William Wyler, or have above-the-titlebilling with Gregory Peck (on your first major movie), we can all learn fromAH—some advice on how to be a star in our own life. And then pass themagic on.

Take yourself seriously. Audrey was lighthearted, but never silly. Modest,but not lacking in confidence. It doesn’t matter where you are on the foodchain—the point is to imbue yourself with the grace and guts that Audreyhad. And move forward.

We know we are asking you to walk a fine line here: Take yourselfseriously (but not too seriously). Because if you don’t, no one will.

YOU are a Star—act like One. Again and again, in speaking with thepeople who worked with Audrey (on her films, during photo shoots, forUNICEF), they said that you met her once, and you never forgot it.

Tzetzi Ganev, the legendary designer with Western Costume in LosAngeles who worked with Edith Head and practically every star of the mid tolate twentieth century—Julie Andrews (“the top of the top”), Lauren Bacall,Greer Garson, Deborah Kerr (“fabulous”), Anjelica Huston, Natalie Wood,Liz Taylor, Barbra Streisand, Bette Davis (“a tough lady. She would chew thedirector to pieces if she didn’t like something”)—says that “the ladies of thattime were so well groomed. They were so well prepared—they were madeup, and their hair was done, the high heels they were going to wear, and theirmakeup, and the stockings!

“Now there is no such thing—actresses today they come without makeupfor fittings, without proper underwear, without shoes, the proper heels, theysay—oh I forgot! I forgot the bra, so they come without the bra, and theydon’t have the bra they are going to wear!”

Tzetzi shakes her head. “Stars today just don’t know how to behave. . . .” 2Surround yourself With great people. Audrey was well-mannered, but shegenerally got what she wanted, and that is because she surrounded herself,professionally, with people who operated at a very high level. When Hedda

Hopper asked her about the details of her Paramount contract, she said, “Ihave no regrets. I had very good agents. I think if I deserve more money, I’llget it. I have a very happy contract.” Her agent, the former boxer Kurt Frings,was (according to Audrey’s first husband, Mel Ferrer) a “devoted andfanatical defender of her interests.”

Move beyond your fears. In spite of the grace and calm that she portrayed on-screen or while giving a speech in public, Audrey suffered from stage frighther entire life. In 1991, she was honored by the Film Society of LincolnCenter, and Ralph Lauren was with her backstage before she walked out togive her acceptance speech. He remembered her as being so nervous, “pacingback and forth.”

The director of the tribute, Wendy Keys, has a similar recollection. If therewas just one moment she could keep in her mind, it was AH walking onstage.“She threw her shoulders back, and this beautiful white chiffon skirt swirledaround her legs as she walked out to greet those people who were so thrilledto see her. It was heightened by the fact that she was so nervous. The sight ofher back, with that beautiful French twist and those shoulder blades likenobody else’s— it was a moment I’ll never get over.”

Have a vision. Even at a very young age, Audrey had an instinct for whatworked for her and what didn’t. Develop yours. And not to get too New Ageyor anything, but before you walk onto that stage, into that boardroom, ontothat airplane, take a few minutes, sit quietly, center yourself, and think aboutwhat it is that you want to accomplish. Then, feel it, really feel it—and allowthe experience into your life.

Look the part. We will get to the specifics of this later, but Audrey said thatwhen she wore Givenchy’s clothing, she felt protected. As a strugglingchorus girl starting out in London, she understood the power of clothes (Shehad just one scarf, which she “knew how to tie seventeen different ways,”recalled a friend). And with the first money she earned as an actress—a smallrole in Monte Carlo Baby, shot in May 1951—she bought her first piece ofcouture, a Givenchy coat.

Hire a good publicist. Birth, Marriage, and Death—in the old days, that’show often members of society wanted to be in the press. Now, with theadvent of cable television, youtube, Us Weekly, Perez Hilton, videostalkarazzi, the Forbes list, IPOs, , the opportunities to end up in the mediaare endless. Is this a good thing? Probably not. All the stuff we know about

celebrities and our public figures today is just noise. And once the press getsa hold of you, they can lift you up, but they can also—and probably will—bethe first to drag you down, as we see in the increasingly public dramas ofBritney, Lindsay, Paris, etc. Being a publicity hound can backfire, so chooseyour appearances carefully.

For this reason (among others), AH generally disliked dealing with thepress. She was just too private a person and, as she became more famous,grew wary of the intrusive questions she was forced to endure (mostly aboutthe state of her marriage to Mel—or lack thereof). In fact, once she marriedher second husband, Dr. Andrea Dotti, in 1969, and moved to Rome, shelimited interviews to half an hour because she believed that after that, thereporter would start asking personal questions.

But—and here is her dichotomy—if she had to promote a movie, or a goodcause like UNICEF, she was more than happy to speak to the press, becauseshe knew she could use her fame to do some good.

# How to Stay Out of the New York Post’s Page Six

Up-and-coming stars of today, take note: Richard Johnson is thecharming and exceedingly well dressed editor of Page Six, theinfluential (and occasionally feared) gossip column that is the first thingcelebrities, former presidents, Ford models, and media movers andshakers on both coasts—and either side of the Atlantic—read eachmorning.

If you behave yourself, you have nothing to worry about—in fact, aPage Six mention can be considered a positive. But if you end up on hiswrong side, or in a holding cell downtown without Bert Fields’snumber on speed dial—watch out. Fortunately, Audrey never had toworry about embarrassing items showing up on Page Six. As Johnsonrecalls, “We didn’t write much about her when she was alive, becauseshe didn’t do much besides her humanitarian work—she was a perfectlady. And Robert Wolders, her companion at the end, was a well-mannered, well-dressed man who knew how to handle things. I wasimpressed.”

And if you don’t hire a publicist, be your own good publicist. If you are aboutto do something in public, ask yourself, “What would Audrey do?” And ifthat doesn’t give you pause, think about how it would look on the front pageof the New York Post or the National Enquirer. And act accordingly.

Throw a tantrum once in a While. Okay, AH never did this, but if youoccasionally throw a tantrum, it can be extremely memorable, especially ifyou don’t normally behave like a diva. The only known instance of Audreybehaving badly 3was during the extremely arduous filming of My Fair Lady.She had been training nonstop for several months, in addition to singinglessons, dancing lessons, elocution lessons with a professor from UCLA,putting up with Rex Harrison’s ego, and practically carrying the entire pictureherself. One fateful day, the musical director, André Previn—possibly takingpity on all of her hard work—finally let her know that her singing voice wasnot going to be used in the film.4 She said, “Oh,” walked off the set, out thedoor, and went home.

The next day she returned and apologized.

Don’t be afraid to disappear. From the way she naturally conducted her life,Audrey understood the inherent appeal of not making yourself too available .. . to the press, your fans, that guy who wants a date on Saturday night. Shealso realized that you need to take time out for yourself. In the middle of anarduous day of shooting, Audrey would skip the commissary and have a quietlunch in her dressing room—even if it did cause one (male) columnist toaccuse her of being stuck-up. She felt that she needed to conserve her energyand not fritter it away socializing.

When she was single, after a long week on the lot, Audrey wouldoccasionally hole herself up in her apartment on weekends, reading, resting,and listening to her beloved jazz records, and just gearing up for the week tocome. So don’t be afraid to disappear for a while. In other words, leave themwanting more.

Don’t trade on your personal tragedies. Audrey certainly had some heartbreakin her life—life during WWII; her father leaving her mother when she wassix years old—but she did not dwell on it. And she very pointedly did notdwell on it in the press to score points, raise her Q Score (frankly, she didn’thave to), jump on Oprah’s couch, or promote whatever movie she was in atthe time.

Audrey kept her private life and her public life separate. Something wewould all do well to keep in mind these days.

Be enigmatic. A natural sense of discretion will give you the reputation ofbeing enigmatic. This is very good for a movie star, and you, to emulate. Italso makes people wonder and, who knows, just might even raise your stock.Live the part. When Audrey was starting out, she had very little money. Bythe time she was a world-famous movie star in the late 1950s, she was buyingFamous, her Yorkie, diamond collars at Van Cleef & Arpels. Clearly, sheunderstood the role of the starlet and could look—and live—the part. Buyquality, not quantity.

# DEALING WITH THE PRESS

Instinctively—like so much else she did—Audrey was genius with the careand feeding of the press. And, like it or not, dealing with the media is often apart of our modern lives. You might decide to run for president, you mightwin American Idol, you might be involved in a coup d’état with the PTA. Inany event, there is a very good chance that you, like Audrey, could findyourself at the receiving end of an interview. Herewith, a few things to tilt theodds in your favor.

Charm the beast. Audrey was so successful with the press because she wasalways, most notably, herself. Whether being interviewed by Hedda Hopperearly in her career, or a People magazine reporter in the late 1980s, she wasalways light, funny, focused, and charming.

When dealing with the press, charm is your ally. Be lighthearted, becharismatic. Pretend it’s a first date. Build rapport with the reporter—seducethe heck out of him/her (metaphorically speaking, of course)—you’re amovie star, after all! When in doubt, use the George Clooney rather than theRussell Crowe model. While truculence looks great on the screen or whileshooting a Calvin Klein print ad, it was a tone that AH never adopted, andgets tiresome in a one-on-one interview. Remember: You’re the one whowanted to be a star, so don’t bail out now.

Whether you choose the patented Tom Cruise “Hey, isn’t life wonderful?”high energy/laugh a lot through the entire interview and reveal nothingtechnique, or the enigmatic “I am an artist” Pacino mode, make sure you have

a game plan going in.

Also, it helps to know that unless you are being interviewed by the WallStreet Journal, Anderson Cooper, or Diane Sawyer, most reporters are reallylazy and don’t do their homework. (They never did any in school, why startnow?) And entertainment “reporters” are probably the worst. Use theirinherent slackerdom (very non-Audrey, we might add) to your advantage.With some effort, you can almost chart what the questions might be, so havea few responses ready.

And if you really get stuck for an answer, smile winningly and then say,“Boy, that’s a great question. . . .” And leave it at that.

Ditch the PR person. You didn’t get where you are by following the rules.With the reporter standing by, tell your corporate PR flunky that you “canhandle this” and show them the door. This will make you look like amaverick and will create a false sense of intimacy between you and thereporter. A false sense of intimacy that you will, of course, exploit fully toyour advantage.

Keep them at arm’s distance. If you are a world-famous actress, physicalseparation is terrific for keeping the press hounds at bay. During her offhours, living in a small village in Switzerland, rather than Bel-Air, and beinggenerally inaccessible was Audrey’s way of dealing with the picayuneattention that came with having one of the most recognizable faces in theworld.

Just say no. The first time AH was supposed to be interviewed by BarbaraWalters in 1971, she turned her down because she had not heard of her anddid not want to answer personal questions. In the years that followed, Barbarabecame a bit more well known, and AH was interviewed by her in 1989.

Hold your ground. No matter what the reporter asks, always hold yourground and answer the question that you want to answer. In a rare filmedinterview following a 1963 press conference announcing the making of MyFair Lady on the Warner lot, the reporter repeatedly tries to corner Audreyand put words in her mouth. She waits, thinks, sometimes asks him to clarifyhis question, occasionally gives him a dazzling smile, and answers exactlywhat she wants. It is quite a performance.

When dealing with the press, the main thing is: Don’t be intimidated; holdyour ground, and try to have as clear a sense as possible of what you want tosay before you go on—that way, you will make sure that you get your point

across.

Ask for final edit. If you are on a news program, ask if you can have finaledit. Unless you are Bill Clinton, it is very unlikely you will ever get this, butwhat the heck—it can’t hurt to ask. Conversely, find out if the show is live,or live to tape. Although (possibly) more nerve-racking, this is potentiallybetter for you, since the producers cannot edit your comments to make youlook silly. Given the kinder media era she grew up in, Audrey never had toworry about any of this.

Don’t live in the press. There are some people (you know who you are) wholive to be in the media. They could be Madonna, they could be the owner ofthe local car dealership who never met a reporter he did not like. Remember,if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword, so the best thing to do iseither stay out of the press as much as possible or use it to your advantageonly when you want to, as AH did.

# On the Red Carpet (or Elsewhere)

Kevin Mazur is one of the preeminent photographers today—a celebfavorite (and all-around nice guy), he has shot Bruce Springsteen, Sting,U2, Dylan, JLo, and Marc Anthony, among others. A regularcontributor to the pages of Rolling Stone and Us Weekly, he is often theonly outsider allowed backstage and on the red carpet at major celebrityevents.

Although Audrey never needed any advice about looking great forthe camera, here are Kevin’s tips for the rest of us.

1. “Have fun! If you have fun with the camera and enjoy yourself, itshows!”

2. “Position yourself sideways to the camera. Don’t stand straight on,that makes you look flat and heavy. Twist your hips and shoulders.”

3. “Try a bunch of different poses—someone like Audrey wasalways great on the red carpet because she really knew how to pose.She gave photographers a lot to work with—she could look serious,smile, look sexy, all within about five minutes.”

4. “Before a big event (say, a wedding), study magazines like Us or

People and see how your favorite stars pose, and what might work foryou. Then try them yourself.”

5. “You want to raise your chin a little, in case you have a few extrapounds; you don’t want any ‘wattle’ under the neck. But don’t tilt yourhead too high, it will look odd.” Practice in front of a mirror if youmust.

6. Finally, stars are comfortable in front of the camera because it’spart of their job. . . . Emulate them—and remember, the camera is yourfriend. Be like Audrey: Use your eyes and flirt with it a little.

7. Again, Kevin reiterated that the main thing is “to have fun with it.Enjoy yourself—that’s the main thing. If you do, that will come acrossin the pictures.”

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Sign autographs? Yes. Within reason. When she shot Gardens of the Worldwith Audrey Hepburn for PBS in 1990, executive producer JanisBlackschlager remembers her stopping briefly to sign autographs in front ofthe Plaza Athénée when she stayed there. “There were always people waitingout front, with thirty-year-old pictures,” she recalled. “And Audrey got a kickout of seeing them again.”

Be extremely low-key? You bet. A friend (granted, a rather clueless friend)was recently seated next to an older gentleman with beautiful blue eyes at adinner party. “And what do you do?” she asked politely. “Oh, I sell saladdressing,” he replied.

A few moments later she realized: Paul Newman.

Although it was practically impossible for her to go unrecognized as Mr.Newman sometimes could, Audrey was the same way.

Care What people Said about her On the Internet? No. AH would neverhave Googled herself. For starters, she would probably be a little freaked outat her extreme popularity (2,110,000 pages in English alone, and counting—and that’s not even including Japan or China).

Would the blogs have affected her? Would she have read something likeTMZ, gawker, or (god forbid) Perez Hilton on the Internet? No.

Throw her weight around? (such as it was) No. She didn’t have to. Because

of her inherent grace (or star quality, or upbringing), people tended to listento Audrey when she spoke. If anything, she was the anti-diva.

There is only one known instance of Audrey even mildly pulling rank,ever, and that was on the set of Two for the Road. Audrey and Albert Finneyand Stanley Donen, the director, were ready to roll, and production was beingheld up for some reason. What was the delay? Audrey wondered. JacquelineBisset (in one of her first acting jobs) was having problems with her makeupand was not quite ready.

“Yes, but I’m ready,” Audrey said quietly.

And . . . action.

Answer her own telephone? Absolutely. Social chronicler DominickDunne was with her in her hotel suite in the 1980s in New York City and heremembers her picking up her own calls, “Hel-lo” in her melodic voice. Herfriends still miss that voice.

# HEPBURN VS. HEPBURN

Although the two Hepburns—Katharine and Audrey—were confusedthroughout their lives (and still are today), these screen icons could not havebeen more dissimilar.5Kate barreled through life doing exactly as she pleasedfor ninety-six years. She had zero interest in marriage, Republicans, orwearing sunblock, didn’t care whom she ticked off, and smoked three packs aday for twenty years before giving it up by going cold turkey at the age offorty.

While she trumpeted her originality, Katharine Hepburn is a distinctAmerican archetype. Invariably described as being of New England stock, aMayflower descendant, and more than a little intimidating (think QueenElizabeth II, Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce, or Barbara Bush), these arenot women who need our help. They’re blue-blood tough guys: reserved,unironic, and often married to much handsomer men they terrorize intosubmission with their intelligence, cojones, fierce backhand, and Mummy’scharitable lead trust on their side.

While Hepburn was known for her style—Those trousers! Thoseturtlenecks! Those cheekbones and graceful stride!—these gals are not. Well,

they might possess style of a sort (i.e., the Church Lady, or Talbots circa1973), but this is not the first thing that comes to mind when their namescome up. Given to A-line skirts, triple-strand pearls, and sensible shoes, theyare emotionally reserved, opinionated, arch—and you can bet they’ll let youknow exactly how they feel on any given topic, be it the presidential race,what color to paint the sunroom, the best way to fire the help, or how to raiseyour children.

With her modesty, grace, less sartorially tomboyish fashion sense, and—dare we say it?—inherent European sophistication, Audrey is the anti-Kate.Because while people might be in awe of the indomitable Miss Kate, theytruly love Audrey.

# Romance Central

“I have more sex appeal on the tip of my nose than many Women have in theirentire bodies. It doesn’t stand out a mile, but it is there.”

—AH

Audrey’s dating life was, like her, both discreet and a heck of a lot of fun. Bytwenty-four she had already been engaged to (and ended it with) Englishbusinessman James Hanson, was on the fence about marrying über male MelFerrer, was madly, madly in love with Hollywood’s resident bad boy WilliamHolden, and was going on the occasional date with Senator John F. Kennedyfrom Massachusetts. (Mary Gallagher, a secretary in his office, remembersthat “the whole office was impressed when she walked in. She was asgraceful as a swan and carried a long, slim, red umbrella.”)

Still, like so much else, Audrey conducted her personal life with a greatdeal of élan. Did she ever question that the man in her life was not madly inlove with her and did not want to marry her . . . like, yesterday? Did she sitaround on Saturday night, waiting for the phone to ring? Did she ever try onan evening dress and ask her significant other, “Does this make me look fat?”Please.

She’s Audrey.

For Audrey, love was very important. As she admitted, “I was born with anenormous love of people, of children. I loved them when I was little! I usedto embarrass my mother by trying to pick babies out of prams at the market.”In a later interview in Vogue, she wondered, “What makes two people happy?It’s like fingerprints: Each one is different. Personally, I need a lot of loving,being loved and giving love. Real love. After that, the rest takes care ofitself.”

But on the other hand, given her childhood, she already knew a great dealof loss and death, and the inherent uncertainty of the human experience. Afterher father left her mother, she knew one hard reality: “Whatever you lovemost, you fear you might lose.”

This was Audrey’s dichotomy—the princess who had experienced suchheartbreak, such death and fear and loss, and kept going. The smiling,

graceful young woman with the old soul. The modest girl who seemed tohave no sense of her beauty and her talent, who was on the verge of havingthe world and all its possibilities laid at her feet.

Although first known for her “style,” that shorthand phrase that does littleto convey the depth of a person, Audrey was a combination of vulnerabilityand strength of character. Perhaps this, even more than the ballet flats orcropped black pants she is known for, is the source of our lasting intrigue inher. Like many creative people, Audrey had deep reserves of emotional needthat she was not afraid to tap into.

As she herself put it, “It always boils down to the same thing— not onlyreceiving love, but wanting desperately to give it, a need to give it!”

And it is, perhaps, this emotional courage that draws us to her still.

But while we might not win an Oscar our first time out of the gate, or dateBill Holden (or who is his modern equivalent—George Clooney? JamieFoxx?), there are still many lessons that Audrey can teach us in the romancedepartment.

# The Pregame Warm-up

How did Audrey get ready for a date? As a single, twenty-four-year-old young woman about town, she admitted:

“I like to have a good hour [to dress for a party]. I take a slow bath,make up, and dress. Then I go to the party and forget about myappearance. Later in the evening I go to the powder room, look in themirror, and say, ‘My God, this is what I’ve been looking like allevening.’ I like parties if I feel like going. Nightclubs occasionally fordancing. It’s fun if there’s someone you want to spend the time with. Iprefer quiet evenings.”

Keep it light. We believe dating is the most Audrey-esque experience youcan have. For starters, look at your life through the prism of Audrey Hepburnand think of all the wonderful adventures you’ll have—zipping throughRome on the back of a Vespa, browsing through Tiffany’s with thathandsome writer, going from being a dowdy Village bookworm to the toastof Paris (well, it could happen). In your Audrey Dating World, keep youroptions open—you never know what might happen next.

For this reason (like AH), we love dating, and—at least until you have a

ring on your finger—advocate dating a bunch of people in your singlehood.In our opinion, dating is the time to be most like Audrey—have fun! Becompelling! Keep your eyes peeled for your own handsome costar.

Audrey met her first serious beau, James Hanson, in the summer of 1950,after she had finished The Lavender Hill Mob, a comedy where she made aminor appearance—one sentence long—with Alec Guinness. She is Chiquita,in an airport lounge, where Guinness calls her over and hands her a wad ofbills: “Oh, but how sweet of you,” she coos, and gives him a thank-you kisson the forehead.

Hepburn and Hanson immediately hit it off. Audrey was twenty-two.Jimmy was twenty-eight, six feet four, and the multimillionaire scion of aYorkshire trucking industry company. He had served heroically in WWII (atthe age of seventeen), from 1939 to its end, with the Duke of Wellington’sregiment in North Africa, Italy, and Greece. Back safely from the war, hedressed impeccably, owned his own plane, and frequented the best nightspotsof London and New York. He loved beautiful women, in particular, actresses.Most recently, he had been seen about town with Jean Simmons, but that wasquickly forgotten once Audrey entered the picture.

As Hanson recalled, “We met at a cocktail party in Mayfair at LesAmbassadeurs, a very popular place, and we were attracted to each otherright away. I invited her for lunch next day, and we soon fell in love, becameengaged a few months later. She was a one-man woman, and it was arelationship of that kind. We became extremely good friends. Everybody sawin her this wonderful life and brightness and terrific strength of character. Shewas a very strong young woman who clearly had the determination she wasgoing to need in order to achieve what she did. She had done a couple ofsmall parts in movies, and her career was just about to blossom. There was nodoubt about that by anybody who saw her.”

Audrey as dating coach. "Discretion is the better part of valor,” saidShakespeare’s Falstaff. In this regard, take the numero uno Love Lesson fromAudrey and keep your personal affairs (largely) to yourself. We’re not sayingdon’t have a girly lunch with Connie Wald 6out by the pool. We’re justsaying don’t go on Oprah Winfrey and jump up and down on the couch thenext time you fall in love.

Brooke Astor, herself an Audrey-esque paragon of virtue and coolness,

never spoke about that sort of thing. “How many loves have you had?”someone had the temerity to ask her in her later years. And she had the equaltemerity not to answer. She would never say, she responded cheerfully,“that’s how I count myself to sleep.”

Don’t reveal your hand. A further corollary of this is: “No daylight on magic”(as Cecil Beaton so famously advised the royal family—a lesson they havesince so famously forgotten). As an actress, as a European brought up in a“nice” (albeit fractured) home, as an essentially private person, Audrey knewthat there was no reason to let everyone see the workings behind the grace.Hubert de Givenchy, one of her closest friends, described her as “shy . . . ifshe had worries she would not show them.”

In this era of the Barbara Walters confessional and People magazine tell-all, discretion is such a rarity that a little mystery goes a long way.

The attractor factor. Everyone we spoke to loved Audrey. Everyone. RobertWolders, the photographers she worked with, seamstresses from WesternCostume in L.A., a guy who had lunch with her at a picnic table during a filmshoot and spoke with her for about fifteen minutes. People met Audrey andnever forgot her.

As her friend Jeffrey Banks admitted, “You looked into her eyes and foundyourself basically agreeing with everything she said.”

Now, we can’t give you the specific formula for being so charismatic. Partof it might be her history. Part of it, certainly, has to be her beauty. ButAudrey took a genuine interest in whomever she was speaking to. As BobWilloughby recalled, “Audrey was not one of those Hollywood types to havea conversation with you, and spent the entire time looking over your leftshoulder to see who else had just come in the room.”

We’re not naming any names here, but if there is the slightest possibilitythat you are ever guilty of this, keep Audrey in mind when you go to yournext cocktail party.

And consider yourself warned.

Juggling lessons from a world-famous actress. Okay, you’ve attracted abunch of promising dating possibilities, but how do you keep them frombumping into one another on your radar screen? Simple, you just do. We’renot saying lie or be deceitful to those you are spending time with (very non-AH), we’re just saying that some information is definitely on a need-to-knowbasis. For example, while shooting Sabrina, Audrey dated JFK, kept Mel on

the back burner in New York City, fell madly in love with her costar,William Holden, and still found time to star in a movie with HumphreyBogart.

That’s our girl.

Audrey and Mel Ferrer were introduced by Gregory Peck, who knew himwhen they started up the prestigious La Jolla Playhouse together. Tall,hyperactive, hyperenergetic, and hyper (hyper hyper hyper) ambitious, Melwas an actor, a radio, stage, and film director (and performer), poet,raconteur, hustler, legendary know-it-all, Hollywood adviser to HowardHughes, Princeton graduate, and possibly the first member of the SocialRegister to appear as a hoofer in the chorus of a Broadway musical, You’llNever Know.7

There was almost too much talent for one man to contain! Born a dozenyears before Audrey, in Elberon, New Jersey, on August 25, 1917, he hadspent most of his early life in New York City. His father, Dr. José Ferrer, aprominent Cuban-Spanish surgeon at St. Vincent’s Hospital in New YorkCity, died when Mel was four.

Audrey and Mel met in July 1953, at a party in London, where Audrey hadreturned for the premiere of Roman Holiday. Married three times, twice to thesame woman,8the father of four was instantly attracted to Audrey. “It wasfascinating to watch Mel move in on Audrey,” remembered Radie Harris, arespected Hollywood journalist who had known him since 1936. “After thatfirst meeting [with Audrey], Mel never let go, and they were inseparable.”

Audrey soon fell in love with the sensitive, soulful character he portrayedin the movie Lili. She also loved his voice, and the way he jokingly signed hisname “Mellifluous.”

Assess the field. We’re not saying act like Field Marshal Rommel here, butwhen you are in the midst of dating a bevy of beaux, or trying to winnow thefield, try to take a clear look at the situation and make the decision that is bestfor you.

When Audrey became involved with her Sabrina costar, William Holden,he was thirty-five years old, warm, handsome, charming as hell—no matterwhat happened, Holden was one of those guys who would always becharming as hell—and at the peak of his career, having just starred in two ofBilly Wilder’s greatest pictures, Sunset Boulevardand Stalag 17.

Audrey did not let the fact that he was a renowned ladies’ man, unhappilymarried to his long- (very long-) suffering wife, Ardis, or had the beginningof a brutal alcohol addiction, stop her from falling in love with him. (“Wecould make beautiful babies together,” she said.) But once things got seriousand she learned that he had had a vasectomy and could not father any morechildren, she quietly put an end to it, as she knew they would never marry.

For Audrey, marriage and children was a deal breaker. And she wasalways clear that that was what she wanted.

Go easy on accepting gifts. Okay, this might just be us, and we are fairly old-fashioned, but we think it is slightly déclassé to be overly enthusiastic (orsuggestive, or demanding) about accepting big-ticket items from boyfriendsand admirers.

Of course, once you are engaged or married, all bets are off. Jewelry,artwork, the occasional horse or drum set, a bouquet of daisies handed to youover a picnic blanket in the park—all are welcomed tokens of affection.

But the Cartier watch Mr. Wonderful gave you for Christmas, when whatyou really wanted was a four-carat stunner? We don’t want to advise you onhow to play your hand, but if you really want to make a statement, tryhanding the little red leather box back to him and saying “no thanks.”Without saying very much—that’s saying something.

Plus, these days it is cooler to buy your own bling, if for no other reasonthan to show the world that you can.

And while we love Jackie, she was far more avaricious than our Audrey.When a man was dating JKO, particularly if he was a Greek shipping tycoon,he was expected to put up the goods. The first time she spent time on theChristina (when she was First Lady and Ari was ostensibly dating her sister,Lee), Ari saw the meager (to his mind) state of Jackie’s jewelry selection andimmediately summoned Van Cleef & Arpels in Paris and presented her witha stunning ruby and diamond bracelet.

Lee was heartbroken and JFK furious, but Jackie nonchalantly wore it backto the White House when she returned.

Clearly, very non-AH behavior.

As a widow in NYC, Jackie accepted substantial donations from BunnyMellon, Robert F. Kennedy, Lazard Frères moneyman André Meyer, and Ari,all to help purchase her apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. An amount thatcould have bought the apartment several times over.

Again (and we are not making any judgments here), very non-AHbehavior. Perhaps it was her experiences during WWII (or her Europeanupbringing), but Audrey was not very materialistic. Yes, she liked nicethings, but she was not flashy, or showy.

Closing the deal. Ladies (and men), don’t be afraid to put your cards on thetable and ask for what you want. A good friend of ours showed true AudreyStyle when, after dating a wonderful man for about five months, he took herout to breakfast and said, “It’s obvious we are perfect for one another, and inlove with one another, and I would like us to live together for a year to seehow things go . . .”

Almost before the words were even out of his mouth, she said (in thekindest way possible, of course), “No way.”

Ever the deal maker (because he did not want to lose her), he said, “Well,what were you thinking?”

“I’ll live with you for one month, that’s long enough to see what’s goingon.”

Now, we don’t know if it is related—but she moved in, and two weekslater they were engaged.

In her own life, Audrey never encountered this situation, as men met her,fell in love with her, and wanted to marry her almost immediately. (“I wasnever engaged, just married,” she once said wistfully of her romance withMel Ferrer; and with her second husband, Dr. Andrea Dotti, she had a three-week engagement, marrying just six weeks after her divorce from Ferrer wasfinal.)

The Goodbye Girl: Exit gracefully. From the workplace to dating to the finalday on a film set, Audrey knew that how you end a relationship is almost asimportant as how you begin—and says quite a bit about you.

We see this as AH ended (somewhat regretfully) her engagement to JamesHanson. After Gigi and Roman Holiday, her life just kept speeding up. Shehad half a day off between the close of the Broadway show and having topack and leave for Rome to start the picture. She loved James and wanted toget married . . . it just seemed that there wasn’t any time. She was in NewYork, or L.A., then Rome, and now back on the road with Gigi. And herfiancé was still back in London. As she told Anita Loos, “When I found Icouldn’t find time to attend to the furnishing of our London flat, I suddenlyknew I’d make a pretty bad wife. I would forever have to be studying parts,

fitting costumes, and giving interviews. And what a humiliating spot to put ahusband in . . . making him stand by, holding my coat, while I signedautographs for bobbie soxers!”

After Roman Holiday finished shooting, she and James had a conversation.According to Hanson, Audrey said, “I really don’t think I want to get marriedat this time. I hate to do this to you. I love your family. . . .” James took it likea gentleman, and remembered, “There was disappointment, yes. But therewas no rift or rupture, just a natural decision made by both sides.” 9

They were still so friendly that they continued to see each other when theycould. At Christmas, Hanson flew to Chicago and spent the holiday with her.As Hanson recalled, “We spent a happy Christmas in Chicago, after whichwe parted as good friends.”

Perhaps the early exit of her father and the trauma of World War II madeAudrey extra sensitive to endings. Perhaps because she was so sensitive tohurts, she was even more careful with others’ feelings, but if Audrey brokeup with you, she let you down easy. And with one notable exception (meanieMel Ferrer, which we will get to later), Audrey cherished her friendships andnurtured them her entire life. You might no longer be making a film together,or be the main man in her life, but once she revealed her heart to you, youwere on Team Audrey forever.

The "what might have been” factor. With use of your newfound WWAD?knowledge, this will be the prevailing sentiment among old admirers (whowill, of course, be half in love with you forever after you so gracefully letthem off the hook). The inherent wistfulness (mostly on their part, natch) ofthe situation is why you want to be a cool Audrey chick when ending things,and not the scary, quasi-stalker ex-girlfriend type.

This sentiment also gives rise to endless country music songs, a ratherromantic ennui, one heck of a backstory, lack of appetite, and prominentcheekbones (all positives in the dating world, by the way), that final scene inCasablanca. . . .

An additional upside of your behaving so proactively is that he willinvariably miss you for the rest of his life, because he will never see you in aratty bathrobe in the morning, bitching about “Why didn’t you go out and getmilk?” You will never argue about whose turn it is to take out the garbage(his, always). He might not even have seen you wearing eyeglasses instead of

contacts.

This glowy, romantic haze has no basis in reality, of course. But what theheck—sometimes it’s cooler to walk, and be seen through the prism of theone that got away. God knows, this is what Audrey did with James Hanson,and with Bill Holden. Decades after they parted, Holden was beinginterviewed on television. “Who was the love of your life?” the host wantedto know.

Bill got a soft look in his eye, forgetting, for a moment, that a camera wason him. “Audrey,” he said finally. “Audrey.”

If all else fails, hit “Delete.” But having said all this, there is one specificinstance where Audrey was so hurt, so betrayed about what happened to herthat she simply cut the man out of her life. And that is with Mel Ferrer.

During her fourteen-year marriage to Mel, Audrey put up with a lot—perhaps because of their son, Sean, born in 1960, perhaps because of societyat the time. Mel, even to those who liked him, was a handful. “Mel was astrange guy,” recalled Dominick Dunne. “I mean, I liked him . . . but he usedto be so grumpy, he was a grumpy man!”

“Mel was a pain in the ass,” says photographer Bob Willoughby, whoremembers him endlessly fussing with Audrey on film sets and slowingthings down.

Even their son, Sean, in his memoir, Audrey Hepburn, An ElegantSpirit,felt that Audrey stayed in the relationship longer than she should have for herown good.

But once she and Mel divorced in 1968, that was it: Mel was crossed offthe list forever.

Audrey did not see him or speak to him until they saw each other againduring Sean’s first wedding ceremony in 1985. Mel had wanted to have thefirst dance with her but she refused, believing, quite rightly, that she and Robshould share that honor.

Touché.

# MEETING AUDREY, MEETING MEL, MEETING MOM

Cecil Beaton, compulsive diarist and the future costume designer for My FairLady, first met Audrey and her mother at their flat in Mayfair on July 23,

1954. They had moved to London in 1948 after the war, to try to improveAudrey’s chances of becoming a ballerina. While Audrey moved from balletto the occasional modeling stint to appearing in the chorus of West Endmusicals, her mother supported them both by working as a manicurist, in aflorist shop, and finally as manager of 65 South Audley Street in Mayfair, anideal situation as it gave them both a place to live.

It was here that Beaton met them.

Beaton was an English dandy of the old school, a Victorian esthete whowore his suits one size smaller because he thought it flattering. He loved theBritish royal family beyond all measure and was secretly, caustically bitchytoward practically every public figure who had the misfortune to cross hispath.

He once famously, terribly, described “the other Hepburn”— Katharine—as “the egomaniac of all time . . . a raddled, rash-ridden, freckled, burnt,mottled, bleached and wizened piece of decaying matter. It is unbelievable,incredible that she can be exhibited in public.” And this was while they wereworking together (quite successfully, she thought) on her 1969 Broadway hit,Coco. “She is a dried up boot,” he decided.

On the other hand—and thank goodness for us—Beaton loved Audrey.

He had heard from Anita Loos what a delightful creature she was, “howfull of talent.” He knew that she had recently been given the leading part in afilm called Roman Holiday, which, he was convinced, “will bring her at thetop of her profession.”

The night of Audrey’s party, Beaton did not miss a thing. “If there were asafety pin, he’d find it,” Andy Warhol said of him.

He was the first to arrive at Miss Hepburn’s flat. “I spoke to the mother,Baroness Heemstra, a lady with a rather charming rolling accent, who told methat her daughter was dressing, was always late. Wouldn’t I have some horsd’oeuvre, a martini? The guests, like all film people on social occasions, wereunconsciously late. Mel Ferrer arrived, a charming, gangling man . . . who,no doubt as a result of his theatrical career, has developed a slightlyprofessional charm of manner. He described A.H. to me as ‘the biggest thingto come down the turnpike.’”

Energetic, addicted to deals and the telephone, both full of himself and abit of a user in that modern American way (and not particularly kind to thosewho could not further his aims), Mel was the anti-Audrey—the kind of man

who attended an Ivy League school and never let you forget it. Needless tosay, Mr. Ferrer was never as universally loved as his future (fourth) bride.

# The Dating Game

Match the beau Audrey was dating to the film she was making at thetime . . .

Audrey appeared. “A new type of beauty,” assessed Beaton, “huge mouth,flat Mongolian features, heavily painted eyes, a coconut coiffure, long nailswithout varnish, a wonderfully lithe figure, a long neck . . .” Still, it wasAudrey’s possible fame that fascinated Beaton. “A.H.’s enormous potentialcinema success, with attendant salary, seems to have made little impressionon this delightful human being. She appears to take wholesale adulation witha pinch of salt: gratitude rather than puffed-up pride. Everything very simple

about and around her: no maid to help her dress, or to answer the door to theguests. . . .”

Not surprisingly, Beaton found himself attracted to her. “In a flash, Idiscovered A.H. chock-a-block with spritelike charm, and she has a sort ofwaifish, poignant sympathy. Without any of the preliminaries I felt that shecut through to a basic understanding that makes people friends. Nothing hadto be explained: we liked one another.”

# THE AH RULES

Forget being a Rules Girl. Instead, opt for something much hipper and be anAudrey Girl.

Date like Audrey. Until there is an engagement, a ring on your finger, or avery serious conversation about where the two of you are going (initiated byhim, of course), keep your options open and keep dating. Don’t act like youare the wife until you actually are the wife (if this is what you want). You’rebusy. You have a life, Bill Holden’s on line two. The worst thing you can dois put your life on hold, waiting for him to get his act together.

Let’s say you would like to get married—something that was definitelyimportant to Audrey. Now, Audrey never had the problem of the man in herlife not asking her to marry him, because frankly, every guy who met herwanted to marry her. Immediately. But back here in the real world, there aredefinitely some Audrey-inspired game plans to help us out.

Don’t talk about yourself . . . except perhaps in the mildest way. Boring!Audrey’s upbringing was almost Victorian in that it was considered bad formto be too showy. In today’s transparent Internet culture, if someone reallywants to find out about you, short of your credit report and the interest rate onyour mortgage—and heck, they can probably figure out that, too—they will.

Flirt like hell. It’s good practice, and it makes the day go faster. Plus, itnever hurts to have the butcher (the waiter, the guy who makes yourcappuccino in the morning) on your side. It also keeps your energy up andmoving in the right direction. Whether you’re waiting in line at the MotorVehicles Department, or running errands on a Saturday morning, it makes lifemore entertaining.

Aim high. Face it, any woman who had Gregory Peck, Hubert de Givenchy,

Ralph Lauren, Nancy Reagan, Albert Finney, Richard Avedon, KevinAucoin, Steven Meisel, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, David Niven, CaryGrant, Fred Astaire, Gary Cooper, William Holden, Isaac Mizrahi, MichaelKors, Rosemary Clooney, Jeffrey Banks, Steven Spielberg, William Wyler,Peter O’Toole, Stanley Donen, and Bill Clinton as admirers must have beendoing something right. If you are going to get in the game, by all means—don’t sell yourself short in the romance or friendship department. Youdeserve the best.

Keep a clear head. As an Audrey Gal, you do not date one person for years(and years and years), waiting for him to make up his mind.10Look at yourromantic situation realistically. With today’s loosened societal structures, youcan tell in a few weeks (or even sooner) if someone is the right person foryou.

And listen to people—when someone tells you something, such as, “I wantto get married (someday), I just don’t want to get married now,” 11believehim. Then make the decision that is best for you.

This will save you a lot of heartache in the long run.

Don’t dumb yourself down. AH never had to act like a dumb blonde,because, frankly, she wasn’t. If some guy is intimidated by your essentialAudrey-esque fabulousness, then you don’t want him in your life, anyway,because the entire point of having a personal relationship is to encourageeach other and raise your standards as high as you can.

R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Otis and Aretha knew what they were talking about whenthey said “respect yourself.” If you are dating someone who is not treatingyou properly, go to Washington and have dinner with that cute senator fromMassachusetts. If you are married and your husband insists on continuing todate, dump him. In other words, don’t be a doormat, and don’t make yourselftoo available.

Keep the real estate. Don’t give up your apartment or home to live with aguy, and if possible, keep your former residence in your own name, in casesomething happens (ahem) in the future. If all goes well, you can always passit on to your children, or nieces or nephews in years to come. Audrey boughtLa Paisible, her home in Switzerland, in 1965, and kept the house throughboth of her marriages and her long-term relationship with Robert Wolders.

Have your own gig. AH was a working woman her entire life, and although

she was married for a time, she was largely in charge of the care of her twosons and her mother, and she also helped out her father. Which leads to . . .

Have your own money. Whether you have a job, work for it, or have yourown inheritance . . . money is freedom.

Include him in your life and your activities. That is, once you have beeninvolved with someone, and trust the situation. For example, if you’ve justwon an Oscar and a Tony, and are currently starring in a Broadway show (asAH did with Mel in Ondine) and are dating an actor, do him, and yourself, afavor: Bring him on as your costar. The critics and producers might cry,“Machiavellian!” 12but hey, at least you’ll be able to spend time together, andit will give you something to do on the weekends when you can study yourlines together.

Disappear for a While. After you’ve closed that hit on Broadway (orwhatever), don’t be afraid to go to Switzerland and rest for a while byyourself, as AH did after a three-month run starring in Ondine on Broadwayin 1954. Mel chased her halfway around the world and begged her to marryhim.

For men, absence really does make the heart grow fonder.

Never underestimate the power of the grand gesture. Once things are settledand you decide to marry, all bets are off—or on (as it were). In August 1954,for his thirty-seventh birthday, Audrey sent Mel a platinum Rolex watch with“Mad About the Boy” (they both loved Cole Porter) engraved on the back.Mel took this as a sign that Audrey was ready to commit to him. He flew toSwitzerland where she was vacationing and formally proposed. And sheformally accepted.

# Movie Magic

Of course, part of the reason we think people fell in love morequickly in the old days was that they had better dialogue. Here areAudrey Hepburn (as Reggie Lampert) and Cary Grant (as Peter Joshua)in Charade, meeting at the ski resort of Chalet du Mont d’Arbois inMageve, Switzerland. Audrey is stunningly dressed in a Givenchy skiensemble, and Cary Grant is, well, Cary Grant. Needless to say, they

are both Euro cool.

CGDo we know each other?AHWhy，do you think we're going to?(annoyed）I don't know-how would I know?

AHBecause I know an awful lot ofpeople and until one of them dies，Icouldn't possibly meet anyone

AH(coolly)Quitter.

# THE AUDREY/GEORGE CLOONEY CONNECTION

Rosemary Clooney, the great American song stylist (and aunt of George),also knew Audrey and Mel in 1953, when Audrey first came to Hollywood.Seated on a couch at a small party at the River House in New York Citythirty-five years later, she tells her own Audrey story.

“Audrey and I knew each other at Paramount—our dressing rooms werenext to each other.” Rosemary smiles, remembering. “She was lovely!

"I was married to José Ferrer13at the time and one night I invited her homefor dinner—it was just the two of us, and after dinner we were sitting,watching television, I think, and she asked me, ‘What do you think of MelFerrer?’ And I said: ‘Oh my god, he’s the worst— he’d walk over anyonewho got in his way, he steamrolls women to get what he wants, he’s terrible. .，

“She didn’t say much, just ‘hmmmmmmmmmm.’

“Later, after she’d left, I spoke to José and said, ‘I think I said somethingthat maybe I shouldn’t have—’

“And he said, ‘What’s that?’

“ ‘Well, I had dinner with Audrey—she asked what I thought of Mel, and Itold her.’

“José said, ‘Big mistake.’

“ ‘Why?’

“ ‘She’s dating him!’

“ ‘What!’

“ ‘You didn’t know that?’

“ ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’

“ ‘Everyone knows!’

“ ‘Nobody told me!’

Telling the story in 1999, Rosemary gave a great laugh—well, what canyou do, it was a while ago, and now, what the heck, it’s a great anecdote. Andwhat happened at the end? “Audrey and I later joked about it and sheeventually forgave me,” recalled Clooney.

But no matter what outsiders thought of the match (and who knows, really,what goes on between two people, because clearly, in the beginning theyloved each other), Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer were married in a civilceremony at Buochs, Switzerland, in the parlor of the local mayor’s house onSeptember 24, 1954. The next day, they repeated their vows at a religiousceremony in a thirteenth-century chapel in Bürgenstock. Audrey wore alyrical Pierre Balmain dress with a crown of white roses, looking as hopefuland impossibly beautiful as any bride.

Her mother wept through the entire ceremony.

# PLAN B: IF HE HAS NO INTEREST IN SAYING, “I DO”

If, on the other hand, he does not want to make the ultimate sacrifice, wemean commitment, you have a few decisions to make. And, of course,Audrey is here to help you make sure they are good ones.

Be the decider. If your ultimate goal is to get married, make a clear decision:Either marry the guy or break it off and move on, as Audrey did with JamesHanson, Bill Holden, and JFK.

Don’t be the eternal girlfriend. You know the one, the slightly woebegonegirl who hangs around forever—decorating his apartment, buying the sheetshe is too busy too buy, cooking elaborate (with many, many hard-to-findingredients) four-course dinners for him every night, and not asking too manyquestions about what the future might bring. And waiting, waiting for him topop the question.

The Eternal GF might get mad, she might sulk, she might complain to hergirlfriends or mother about how he “needs more time” and “isn’t ready” tomake a real commitment just yet. But still, like Penelope at her loom in thetower, waiting for cunning Odysseus, she waits. And waits. And waits.

Please.

Whatever your age. Whatever life experiences brought you to a placewhere you think it is okay to hang around and wait for scraps (or, worse, thatthis is the way it is supposed to be), listen to us, and if you’re not going tolisten to us, listen to Audrey: Don’t Be That Woman.

If a man wants to be with you—wants to marry you, perhaps raise childrentogether, hang out in the South of France, wake up next to you every day forthe rest of his life, bring you coffee in bed—he is going to close the dealpronto (as Andrea Dotti would have put it). And no amount of love, will,desire, or “hanging in there” on your part is going to make it happen.

Dating is not like a Law & Order episode, where possession is nine-tenthsof the law, because frankly, you could cook dinner for him, clean his car, andpick up his dry cleaning for the rest of your life and still not get what youwant.

And whatever you do—don’t fall into the trap of moving in with the guy,believing that this will invariably lead to a walk down the aisle, which is whyAudrey never did anything like this when she wanted to get married. Don’tbe half-assed. And trust us: Men respect power (in themselves and others).

Treat yourself with the respect you deserve, and the guy you are with will,too.

Don’t demean yourself by hanging around forever. Asking “When are wegoing to get married?” is as pointless as asking “Do you love me?” or worse,“Does this make me look fat?” When you’ve reached the point where you areasking those questions, it is clearly time to shake the whole thing up withyour Holly Golightly-inspired consciousness. So go to Rome for the summerand shoot a movie, get your hair cut, sell your screenplay for a nice six-figuresum, buy those Manolos you’ve been coveting, rent a convertible, and driveup the coast (say, to Maine).

There is just no way Audrey would hang around waiting for some guy tomake up his mind. In 1953, while AH was in San Francisco with the roadtour of Gigi, columnist Dorothy Kilgallen asked if she’d “always had thismany beaus buzzing around her.” She replied, “Well, I’ll say this—I’ve neverwanted for one—not since I was seventeen, anyway.”

Take his name. No matter how liberated or evolved your man (says he) is,remember: Every man secretly wants his wife to have his surname. It’s apride thing.

If you are an author or world-famous actress, you might have to keep yourname professionally, but in your private life, take his. While Audrey mayhave been “Audrey Hepburn” above the credits, she was proudly “AudreyHepburn Ferrer” or “AHF” (or later, S. Dotti) in her personal life.

Sometimes, you just have to laugh at ’em. After Audrey broke up withHolden, he promptly went on an extended world tour and tried to forget herby seducing a different woman in every country. Which he pretty muchmanaged to do. Back in Hollywood he told AH the story, perhaps to makeher jealous, but her response was to laugh and say, “Oh, Bill . . .”

Be a riddle Wrapped Up in an enigma. Keep them guessing about yourpersonal life. When AH shot Roman Holiday, the gossips were awash instories that she and Gregory Peck were having a romance. In fact, he had justmet the woman who would become his second wife (the journalist VeroniquePassani). Knowing the real story, Audrey and Greg had a lot of laughs aboutthis.

Behave well. Be gracious and remember: Real life (like Hollywood) is alot like high school—everybody talks!

Be yourself. Dating is really the perfect time to get out in the world, learn

what you like, negotiate what works for you, and, quite frankly, have fun.Having said this, the best way is to just be relaxed and be yourself. Easiersaid than done, perhaps, but just think of how much people will like youwhen they see your real personality.

Enthusiasm—not coolness—is cool. Audrey had enthusiasm in spades.Dominick Dunne’s first memory of her is at a dinner party at Gary Cooper’swhen she first arrived in Hollywood.

“Rocky Cooper ran a fabulous house . . . ,” he recalled. “This was whenpeople made an effort, when women wore jewelry to dinner. . . .” He didn’tknow her then but she was seated down the table from him, and Billy Wilderhad just said something that made her laugh. “Oh, she had a great laugh,”Dunne recalls. “Such a great laugh from such a tiny woman. I loved it.”

So if you feel strongly about something—a joke you just heard, the latestSimpsons movie, the Republican Party—let people know.

Keep the faith. And finally, this is probably the most important Audrey-esque attribute to take to heart. At the risk of possibly belittling theimportance of your personal life, this will serve you well not only insocializing, but at work, in life, everything—and that is: Have faith.

No matter what happens—never lose sight of what you want and also ofthe belief that it will (somehow) all work out in the end. As Martin LutherKing, Jr., said, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands inmoments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times ofchallenge and controversy.”

So wherever you stand in your life right now—and believe us, there maybe some dark days someday—keep going, keep going. As Audrey did.

And look at it this way: If nothing else, you will have some great stories totell your grandchildren.

# How to Meet (Movie Star) Cute

You’ve seen it in the movies. Stars are always meeting and falling inlove in the most opportune ways—at a bookstore, in an elevator, on theTitanic while it is sinking. . . . It’s terrific. Here are some Audrey Waysto meet your own leading man (or lady).

# Meet at work.

Face it, Hollywood is one giant dating pool, with the best-lookingpeople in the world meeting on movie sets, at the gym, Pink’s hot dogstand, the craft services table. Not only is there is a lot of downtime tohang out and socialize, but people are often paid (a lot) to get throwninto inherently romantic situations to see what develops.

Frankly, we think this is fabulous!

Why don’t you mimic this? Recent studies say that more than $4 3 \%$ ofpeople meet their spouse/significant other at the office . . . because thisis where people are spending $9 3 \%$ of their waking hours, anyway, sowhy not?

# Don’t overlook the nice guy.

AH admitted herself that she barely would have given Rob W. a secondlook when she was younger, but in her Third Act, this kind,gentlemanly, and, quite frankly, très handsome man was Audrey’s beauideal. After years of disappointment, here, finally, was a man who hadher best interests at heart.

And still does.

# Become famous.

How you accomplish this is up to you, but we think it is best to do thison the strength of your accomplishments, rather than infamy. ThinkCharles A. Lindbergh or Jonas Salk rather than O. J. Simpson. Sowhatever you’re doing, try to be the absolute best you can be. Right outof the box, Audrey was a star—above-the-title billing, an Oscar, anEmmy, and the cover of Time magazine, all within the same year.We’re not saying it’s fair, we’re just saying it’s true. So whether it beinventing the Internet, collecting comic books, or writing a column forthe local newspaper, become obsessed with something you are reallygood at, and raise your profile accordingly, because famous people getlots more dates than the non-famous.

# Let friends fix you up.

The old reliable is still the best way to meet people. In fact, Audrey metboth her husbands and Rob Wolders through friends introducing them.

# SEX APPEAL $\ c =$ THE .7 SOLUTION

What do Audrey Hepburn, Kate Moss, Twiggy, Sophia Loren, MarilynMonroe, Liz Taylor, Raquel Welch, and even Elle “The Body” Macphersonhave in common? Their waist-to-hip ratio is .7.

Let us explain. According to Dr. Devendra Singh, a psychologist at theUniversity of Texas at Austin, who has spent the past twenty-five yearsstudying the correlation between body shape, health, and perceptions ofbeauty, all of these women—in addition to being legendary beauties—haveone thing in common: Their waists are noticeably narrower than their hips.

In scientific terms, this is known as WHR—the waist-hip ratio— and,according to Dr. Singh, this very scientific ratio is what makes men findcertain women attractive. For everyone who failed in biology, the hourglasscurves of a woman (along with clear skin, bright eyes, and glossy hair)signify fertility, and men are biologically programmed to act accordingly.“Basically,” says Dr. Singh, “a man wants a woman who is strong, who ishealthy, and can bear healthy children and be able to raise them.”

In a 1995 study, Dr. Singh studied males from Africa, the Azores, HongKong, India, the Netherlands, and the United States. Volunteers were given aselection of photographs of females of different shapes and sizes and asked torank them in terms of physical beauty. “They all selected the same women,”Dr. Singh says, somewhat amazed. “They all seemed to like women with alow waist-to-hip ratio. We also wanted to see how early it starts. In Americaand India, eight-year-old boys selected the same women as the grown-ups.They looked at the women and said, ‘That’s the one that’s beautiful.’ ” Dr.Singh compares this low-WHR instinct with people’s innate love of sugar:“You don’t have to teach a kid to like chocolate,” he observes.

Totally un-PC, but probably true.

So here’s the deal with the .7 solution—are you optimistic enough to find outyours? To determine the ratio, divide your waist measurement (in eitherinches or centimeters) by your hip measurement. Ideally, you want somethingin the .7 to .9 range. And putting aside for a moment your secret dream oflooking like a Marc Jacobs model, there is a medical reason for keeping aneye on this measurement. Research shows that people with “apple-shaped”

bodies (with more weight around the waist) face more health risks such asdiabetes or heart disease than those with “pear-shaped” bodies who carrymore weight around the hips.

And what does this “belle” curve have to do with Audrey—who did notcarry much weight at either her waist or her hips? If her dress form atGivenchy’s atelier is to be believed—and god knows, we think it is—Audreymaintained an impressive $3 1 \% ^ { 6 } \ – 2 2 ^ { 6 } \ – 3 1 \% ^ { 6 }$ her entire life. But at the end of theday (spoken like a true man), Dr. Singh says that “in spite of all thesescientific commonalities, beauty is still a mystery.” 14

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Ask a guy out first? That would be a no. Without even intending to, Audreywas probably one of the first (as were most of the women in the 1950s) RulesGirls.

Offer to pay On a date? See above.

Try Internet dating? Okay, for starters, she is Audrey Hepburn, and half thewomen on the site are probably using the term “Audreyesque” to describethemselves. To say nothing of all the Audrey fan sites that she would nodoubt be a little freaked out by.

Keep her (romantic) cards close to her chest? Yes. Audrey had her share oflove affairs, but did we know about them? No. “She had her romances,”observed Bob Willoughby, “but nobody really knew it at the time.” When itcame to her love life, Audrey knew enough to keep ’em guessing.

Hesitate to ask a fiancé for business advice? No. In fact, James Hanson wasvery helpful when AH was just starting out. Signed to a restrictive contractwith a British studio, as an old friend of Lew Wasserman’s of MCA, Hansonwas able to “put in his two cents’ worth” to improve her contract withParamount. And he did.

Believe in love at first Sight? Yes. Audrey met her second husband, Dr.Andrea Dotti, at a Mediterranean cruise hosted by Princess Olimpia Torloniaand her industrialist husband, Paul-Louis Weiller. Andrea was an assistantprofessor at the University of Rome. Handsome, witty, charming, and nineyears Audrey’s junior, he quickly became smitten. He said that he and

Audrey fell in love “somewhere between Ephesus and Athens. It was not thatshe came to cry on my shoulder about the breakup of her marriage. . . . Wewere playmates on a cruise ship with other friends, and slowly, day by day,our relationship grew into what it is.”

For her part, Audrey said, “Do you know what it’s like when a brick fallson your head? That’s how my feelings for Andrea first hit me. It justhappened out of the blue. He was such an enthusiastic, cheerful person [and]as I got to know him, I found he was also a thinking, very deep feelingperson.”

# chapter 3

# Zen Audrey

“I think the most compelling thing about her Was that she Was so present.That’s a lesson for Us all.”

—Kevin Aucoin

Audrey Hepburn was cool.

And not because she was beautiful, or had Givenchy designing for her, orthat her day job was as a world-famous actress. In fact, it could be argued thatAudrey was a world-famous actress, and cool, and possibly even beautiful,because of everything going on within her—the Audrey that few people, saveher family and close friends, got to see.

In this chapter, we explore Audrey’s interior life, and the not so obviousthings that made her so compelling—her discipline, her intelligence, hergenerosity (as Diana Vreeland said, “Some people give in this world andsome people take. . . .”). But coupled with her extremely public life, there isalso her shyness, her privacy, and her need for solitude.

Audrey’s emotional core was interesting because she was both vulnerableand exceptionally strong. This vulnerability is what made her such acompelling actress—you see her on the screen, and you know exactly whatshe is feeling. But she was also—and please excuse the very non-AHexpression—within her femininity and her grace: strong as hell.

And it is this tension (we think) that makes Audrey such a remarkableperson to watch. Cathleen Nesbitt, who was assigned by the producers ofGigi to take Hepburn under her wing when she first appeared on Broadway,thought Audrey did not “have much idea of phrasing. She had no idea how toproject, and she would come bounding onto the stage like a gazelle. But shehad that rare thing— audience authority, the thing that makes everybody lookup at you when you are on stage.”

Finally, we recognize the importance of having an interior life. For it isonly by studying the many facets of Audrey’s experience that we can learn tocultivate our own interests—whatever they might be—and elevate our ownexperience.

“Beauty is not caused,” wrote Emily Dickinson. “It is.” Audrey’s beauty was

based not only on her physical attributes (which were considerable), but herinterior self. Part of it was her history. You might not know much about her,but you just knew from looking at her—even when we first saw her in RomanHoliday at the age of twenty-four—this is a woman who has had a veryinteresting life.

Most if it came from within—her intelligence, her humor, hervulnerability, all that was asked of her. She carried it all on her slim, straightshoulders: the absence of her father, advancing her mother’s hopes, thehunger of her adolescence, the loss, the secrets, the uncertainty. As well asthe need for beauty. For peace. Some kind of grace.

And like all great actors she had a need—love me. Love me, and I will putmyself before you. I will show myself on screen, in photographs. You willnever know me, of course, not the real me, but you will know the dream ofme. The dream I choose to present to you— that better version of yourselfyou wish to become.

And then I will disappear. Like all great artists, I know the power of thefinal act, and the resilience of the human heart.

But whether it was her looks, her intelligence, or the tone of her voice—whatever alchemy combined to make Audrey Hepburn the memorable personshe was is almost beside the point. Because the fact remained, if you metAudrey, there was a very good chance that you would never forget it.

Director Billy Wilder knew this. At a tribute at Lincoln Center in 1991, herecalled that “the first picture I made with Audrey was Sabrina, and I veryvividly remember the very first day, the very first scene, actually. You lookedaround and suddenly there was this dazzling creature looking like a wide-eyed deer prancing through the forest, and it took exactly five minutes foreverybody to fall in love with her—the cameramen, the other actors, theextras, the electricians, and yours truly also.”

But unlike most stars of her caliber (or, let’s be honest, lesser caliber or nocaliber at all), Audrey was not a vast vortex of egomania and take, take, take,take, take. She gave. As a friend, she had a tremendous capacity to give love.And once she trusted you, that was it.

Connie Wald, the widow of well-known Hollywood producer Jerry Waldand a dear friend of Audrey’s, was asked: What was it like to have her as afriend?

“It was like the rest of her life, she was thoughtful and loving and full of

care. I remember one Easter, she arrived here, and she had this huge box froma great chocolatier in Lausanne, and the box of little eggs, the most beautifulthing, and she lugged it all the way from Switzerland! And flowers, andletters . . .

“She was just, as they say, the perfect friend. We would always laugh atpeople and situations and carry on. Private jokes. She had a delicious sense ofhumor.”

But the emotional accessibility that made her such a great friend or artist—can anyone forget the look in her eyes in Roman Holiday when she andGregory Peck realize they are never going to see each other again?—alsomade her more sensitive to the slights and barbs that make up living.According to Rob, “once she sensed that she could trust somebody, she’d doanything for them. And if she were disappointed in them, it would be the endof the world for her. She suffered more than most of us.”

Audrey herself was not unaware of this emotional tendency in herself,admitting to Larry King that “it always boils down to the enormous need ofnot only receiving love, but an enormous need to give it! It is true that I hadan extraordinary mother. She herself was not a very affectionate person in thesense that I today consider affection. I spent a lot of time looking for it, Ifound it. She’s a fabulous mother, but she came from another era, she wasborn in 1900, Victorian influence still. Of great discipline, of great ethics.Lots of love within her, not always able to show it. And very strict.”

But when Audrey was with animals or children, there were noexpectations, no need to perform. They didn’t want anything from her. Shecould just be herself in the same way that animals and children just “are.”And in them, Audrey sensed a vulnerability—on some level, they needed her—that allowed her to open her heart.

# POSSIBLE EMOTIONAL UPHEAVAL SITUATION #1:WHEN THE CARDS FALL IN YOUR FAVOR

It is one thing to stay humble when you are slinging coffee at Starbucks(heck, it’s practically a requirement), but in true Audrey fashion, you aregoing to be a huge success at whatever endeavor you undertake—and thenwhat? Herewith, following AH’s life lessons, our advice.

# Stay Centered |

And so we have the question: What happens after success? As screenwriterAlbert Goldman observed, “No man is really changed by success. Whathappens is that success works on the man’s personality like a truth drug,bringing him out of the closet and revealing . . . what was always inside hishead.”

# | Check Your Ego at the Door |

In Audrey’s case, we have spoken to dozens of people who knew her—as afriend, on movie sets, during photo shoots, even during the UNICEF trips,and never, never, never did she show one iota of star ’tude.

(Now, Mel . . . on the other hand, was Mr. Attitude. Years ago in NewYork—and we are admitting up front, this is a terrible story, but wonderful,too, because it reveals character—Dominick Dunne had a secretary who wasMel’s personal secretary before working for Dunne. She had run errands forMr. Ferrer and he owed her some petty cash. He paid her in stamps.

Not food stamps. Not S & H stamps.

“Postage stamps!” Dunne practically crows as he tells this story, nearlyfifty years later. “Audrey never would have done that!”)

Instead, we have stories of Audrey bringing homemade brownies to the setof The Children’s Hour (and Shirley MacLaine rhapsodizing over the“powdered sugar sprinkled on top”). Buying Rob a puppy for his fiftiethbirthday, because he had never had a dog before. Leaving a message onfamed hairstylist Garren’s home machine, after he had done her hair for aVanity Fair shoot with Steven Meisel. “Hello, this is Audrey Hepburn, I’mnot sure if you remember me. . . .” (And don’t worry, Garren saved the tape.)

# Don’t Lose Yourself

Audrey may have looked like a princess, but she rose to the top—and stayedthere—of one of the most brutal, cutthroat, and demanding professions in theworld. Part of her success as a person (and, truth be told, as an actress) is that

she knew who she was and, throughout her life, remained true to her essentialnature. This proved enormously helpful as AH navigated the hothousestratosphere where celebrities and, in particular, Oscar-winning actresses canbasically get away with anything they want—and then parlay that into a) anOK! magazine cover story with photo, writer, and text approval and b) acareer resurgence.

# Cultivate Other Interests

Audrey loved music, and loved to dance. In her free time off the set, shelistened to jazz and was known to lug her LPs to whatever house or hotel shewas renting. She also had a very good ear and spoke four languages. She hadmany loves—small dogs, couture, William Holden (for a time), and theoccasional Scotch.

She also loved to read—fiction, poetry. In later years, UNICEFphotographer John Isaac was stunned when she recited his favorite poet,Rumi, back to him.

# | Remain Low-Key

You are one of the most famous personalities of your time, and yet you arealso one of the nicest, kindest, and most memorable to work with. . . . Wecan’t give you any advice how to pull off this tightrope walk, but do it. Forpsychic, emotional, and just generally good karma (as well as all of thepositive things your friends will say about you behind your back), be astalented, low-key, generous, and inherently cool as you possibly can. ThinkElvis Presley. Think George Clooney. Think Meryl Streep. Has anyone everhad a bad thing to say about them?

It’s worth it.

# | Get Over Yourself |

As a world-famous actress, AH could have run roughshod over anyone in her

path (see: Elizabeth Taylor in her heyday). Instead, she revealed her inherentstyle by extending herself to others. In 1976, she told People magazine, “Idon’t think you have to make just the big gestures to be helpful. Every secondof every day you can do something. Just a cheerful smile does wonders for abeginning.”

# Remember What Mom (Really) Thought of You

If you are an international superstar trying to keep your feet on the ground, ithelps to have a mother who is somewhat dismissive of your talent (at least toyou), so that you don’t get a swelled head. By all reports, Audrey’s motherwas old-style: a “stiff upper lip,” somewhat Victorian woman—she had tohave been, to survive the Nazis in 1943—and Audrey definitely sufferedfrom her emotional remove.

There is also her jaw-dropping quote in regard to her well-known daughter:“Isn’t it remarkable how far you’ve gotten considering how little talent youhave?”

In the excessively child-centric era we live in today, even we have to say:Wow.

“Pick a day. Enjoy it—to the hilt. The day as it comes. People as theycome . . . the past, I think has helped me appreciate the present—andI don’t want to spoil any of it by fretting about the future.”—AH

# POSSIBLE EMOTIONAL UPHEAVAL SITUATION #2:WHEN THINGS DON’T GO YOUR WAY

Now, we realize: It is easy to be Zen and groovy and accepting when thecards fall in your favor. But what happens when they don’t?

For Audrey, one of her professional challenges came when she failed to benominated for an Oscar in My Fair Lady. Hollywood, Jack Warner, and all ofAudrey’s friends were in an uproar. The press, always willing to stir upcontroversy, encouraged the media frenzy that followed when Julie Andrews(who originated the Eliza Doolittle role on Broadway but would not auditionfor the movie role, and hence was not officially offered it) was nominated for

# Mary Poppins.

The story has always been that AH was distraught and heartbroken that shewas not nominated. That it was a huge deal for her.

In reality, Audrey was pretty accepting about the whole thing.

In an amazing (and newly unearthed) letter she wrote to director GeorgeCukor on March 8, 1965, she laid out her thoughts about the whole brouhaha.

“As for the whole nomination mishmosh—I think I am the only one not inthe dark,” she writes. Everyone is searching for an “explanation,” and itseems to Audrey that the whole thing is all very simple: “My performancewas not up to snuff.” Further, she goes on to assure Cukor that if people wereout to get her, or Jack Warner, or if they wanted to “ensure Julie Andrews’sOscar, their sentiments would have automatically been cancelled out had mybravura been worthy.”

She confides in Cukor that “because MY FAIR LADY meant so terriblymuch to me I had sort of secretly hoped for a nomination but never countedon the Oscar. Therefore disappointed I is but not astounded like my chumsseem to be or a lot of the press for that matter.

“What does amaze me is the bullabaloo which ensued and the constantpressure which was brought about for almost a week to get me to come toCalifornia for the big night. . . .”

# | Think! (Pink or Otherwise)

Audrey used her brain. She considered things. According to Rob, “In myexperience, Audrey was the most introspective person I have ever met,always trying to discover, self-discovery. On the other hand, she had anextraordinary ability to laugh, to try to enjoy life. So she would be verydetermined to get to the essence of an issue, which required study andapplication, but then afterwards, she had this tremendous need to laugh, toamuse. A great cut-up. She was always able to make fun of herself.”

# Respect Yourself

When she sang, “Respect Yourself,” soul singer Mavis Staples knew what

she was talking about, as (in her own way) did Audrey.

Bob Willoughby, who spent close to thirty years on the very incestuousatmosphere of film sets (part boot camp, part luxury to rival Louis XIV), hasa very good observation about Audrey. “Hollywood is very gossipy,backbiting—it’s worse than grade school! People in Hollywood always takepotshots at one another, but with Audrey— never. I never saw or heardanything like that. And I think the clue is: Automatically, in her own way, shedemanded respect.”

# | Develop a Sense of Privacy |

Audrey obviously had a lot going on, inside. This used to be called“European mystery.” You could tell just by looking at her, Audrey had a verycool interior life—you just were not part of it. And yet, she was veryemotionally open and vulnerable as a person, and as an actress. This isespecially intriguing to us as Americans, since we tend to Let EverythingOut, at all times.

# | Make Time for “Me” Time

Like all great stars—those whose luck or talent plucked them from obscurity—Audrey, Bob Willoughby thought, had “this dichotomy that you felt shewas a good friend, and yet, you felt there was a distancing. Usually, if yousee actors on the set and they are sitting out between takes, there is atendency for the crew to sit and schmooze— I never see that with Audrey.There was some deference that the crew gave to her to give her the timealone.”

Stanley Donen, who directed her in three movies 15and who knew her aswell as anyone, felt the same way. “[Audrey] had polished her personalityuntil it didn’t have a rough spot anywhere. But there was another, hidden partof her persona. With all of her manners, she kept me from getting totallyintimate. So I longed to get closer, to get behind whatever was the invisible,but decidedly present barrier between her and the rest of us mere mortalhuman beings. Something, some unseen screen was there, holding me back

from getting as close as I wanted. That barrier made her all the moredesirable.

“I don’t mean to imply that I thought she was playing a game with me. Butshe always kept a little part of herself in reserve, which was hers alone, and Icouldn’t ever find out what it was, let alone share it with her.”

This solitude was part of Audrey’s strength: Her secrets, her experience,even her celebrity drew us to her and kept us apart. This impossibleunknowing, too, made us love her even more.

# | Be Consistent

But perhaps most importantly—as one of the most famous women in theworld her entire adult life—here are some of the things Audrey didn’t do:Develop an OxyContin addiction; become a spokesperson for the NRA;appear on QVC (although who knows—she might have, to raise money forUNICEF); appear on Oprah; become a Scientologist; live in a gatedcommunity; marry her trainer/bodyguard/backup dancer; own a G4 jet; gethospitalized for “exhaustion”; close down a movie set for bad behavior; dateGeorge Clooney; spend time at Promises; cry on a Barbara Walters Special;refer to herself in the third person as “the People’s Princess”; drive aHummer; expose her belly button; have a child out of wedlock; get married inVegas; give too much of herself away; visit the Playboy Mansion; appear ona reality television show; get a tattoo; befriend Michael Jackson; date a rockstar; get breast implants; allow La Paisible to be open for tours after herdeath; get paid to wear a designer’s clothing; appear in Us Weekly magazine;write a tell-all; expound her religious beliefs; be asked “What are youwearing?” at the Oscars by a reporter; hurt anyone’s feelings; hire KenSunshine; get arrested for shoplifting; forget to say thank you; get a DUI; doa perp walk; appear on David Letterman; be a punch line for one of DavidLetterman’s monologues; have embarrassing videos of herself show up onthe Internet; do anything to embarrass herself—or us—ever.

Namaste, Baby . . . Clip-and-Save Audrey Advice

This one’s for the bathroom mirror—one of our favorite Audreyquotes. And, really, if you think about it, it is all about acceptance andgratitude. Two things we can all do well to keep in mind.

When the chips are down, when you are having a crummy day, week,year, keep this in mind, from our girl Audrey: “I decided, very early on,just to accept life unconditionally; I never expected it to do anythingspecial for me, yet I seemed to accomplish far more than I had everhoped. Most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seekingit.”

# HOW TO CULTIVATE YOUR INNER AUDREY

# | Turn It Off When she needed to recharge her energy, AHhightailed it out of Hollywood, or whatever film set she was on,and headed to Switzerland. Or Paris.

Your options do not need to be so dramatic (or costly). Instead, take abreak from the television, newspapers, magazines, or endlessly scanning theInternet for the latest “news” (which is, generally, truth be told, bad news).Go for a walk, take a yoga class, meditate for an hour, sit on a park bench,and read for a while.

# Make the World Go Away

In spite of your view of your own personal self-importance, you do notalways need to be so accessible. When Charles de Gaulle was president ofFrance, he would go to his country house for the weekend and holidays. Ifyou wanted to reach him, you would call the guardhouse, they would writedown the message, and an aide would walk it to the main house.

And de Gaulle would respond. Or not.

So it is not a bad thing to turn off the endless stream of modern media, andyour BlackBerry, and the phone, and take a breather from it all. Your brainwill thank you. And since stress plays havoc with your looks, your skin will

thank you, too.

“The world is too much with us,” said Wordsworth. And he was right.

# | Throw Off the Traces Once in a While |

In the utterly believable Roman Holiday, Princess Audrey skips out on theroyal gig and enjoys a day (and night) of freedom with the preternaturallyhandsome Gregory Peck. While we’re not saying make a habit of it (there is,after all, no known evidence of Slacker Audrey), go ahead—call in sick,leave your BlackBerry home, hop on the back of that Vespa and go for a ride.Go to Paris and study cooking. When that Dick Avedon-esque photographerasks you to dance, say yes.

# | Lose Your Inner Scrooge

If you don’t like (well, love) children, this is not very Audrey-esque, becauseit turns out that Audrey loved babies, children, and all animals (butparticularly small dogs). So when you’re on a plane in first class and a nearbytoddler is having a meltdown, think of a way to help the situation rather thanrolling your eyes and bitching to the stewardess.

# | "The Hell with It”

Perhaps it had something to do with the fear, or the unexpected violence shesaw during World War II, but Audrey was very aware—at a very young age—of the random nature of life. In our most useful example of Zen Audrey,AH always did the best that she could, whatever her situation—her earlyballet lessons, working on Roman Holiday or My Fair Lady, her marriages,raising her children—and then said: The hell with it, and let the chips fallwhere they may.

# | Enjoy Your Own Company |

We’re not saying you need to turn into Greta Garbo, but Audrey had noproblem being alone. In fact, there were times she preferred it.

Once, a reporter asked, “Do you ever feel lonely?”

And she responded, “When the chips are down, you are alone. That’s thekind of loneliness that is terrifying. Fortunately, I’ve always had a chum Icould call. And I love to be alone. It doesn’t bother me one bit. I’m my owncompany, though I wouldn’t want to be alone because nobody loves me orcares for me. I can spend time happily alone because I know somebody isgoing to walk in the door. I’m rather cheerful by nature—it’s my best defenseagainst the aches on the inside.”

# In Case You Are Still Wondering— Why Bother withYour Interior Life?

Trust us: No matter how Audrey perceived, or presented, herself, shehad it.

Bob Willoughby, the photographer who shot practically every star inthe world during the glory days of Hollywood—Marilyn Monroe,Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, James Dean, Mia Farrow, SophiaLoren sitting on Elvis’s lap—thinks that “real beauty comes from theinside. I used to photograph tons of very pretty girls. There’s adifference between a very pretty girl, or a very beautiful girl, andsomebody who was truly beautiful. Audrey was to me . . . that waswhere my feeling of beauty was, and Hollywood necessarily with allthe makeup and all the fantasy things, it wasn’t my thought of whatbeauty was.”

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Disappear for the weekend? Absolutely. Especially during an arduous shootwhen she needed her rest. After she married and bought the place inSwitzerland, she disappeared for years (no, just kidding . . . actually, shehung out there between movie gigs and fielded offers).

Turn off her phone/cell phone/BlackBerry? No, but she would probably haveleft them at home and gone for a walk if she wanted a break.

Multitask? No! Audrey was not one of those people who balanced hercheckbook while attending the opera (don’t laugh, we’ve seen it), or put onmakeup in the car while talking on the phone and slurping coffee, drivingdown the 405.

Instead, Audrey focused on whatever she was doing at the time— having afitting, writing a speech for UNICEF, goofing around with the dogs—andmoved on to the next thing. This gave her focus and equanimity. Plus, sheaccomplished more.

“When she reads, she reads; when she fits, she fits; when she talks clothes,she talks clothes; when she sits under a drier, she simply sits and dries,”reported Cosmopolitan. “She is the only actress I’ve ever had who doesn’tgab, read, knit, wriggle, pick her teeth, or eat a lettuce and tomato sandwich,”said her hairdresser.

Disguise her voice when answering the phone? No. While Jackie Kennedypretended to be her maid (at times) when she was home and did not want tobe disturbed, Audrey never did this. Her voice was too distinctive, forstarters.

Follow a particular religion? No. As she said, "I have enormous faith, but it’snot attached to any one religion . . . my mother was one thing, my fatheranother. In Holland they were all Calvinists. That had no importance at all tome.” Another time, she noted, “Nature is my religion.”

Admit that she learned some positive lessons from her mother? Yes. AH hassaid that her mother was raised in a "strict, Victorian upbringing,” and thatshe had suffered from her mother’s emotional reserve. “She was verydemanding of us—of me and my brothers.” Still, the baroness taught lessonsthat stayed with Audrey for life: “ ‘Manners,’ as she would say, ‘don’t forget,are kindnesses. You must always be kind.’ . . . She was always very adamantabout that.”

Ever get angry at someone? And if so, how would she show it? According toRob, “It depended on who Audrey was mad at—if it was someone she didn’tknow well, or care about, then she could walk away. But not evendisdainfully; she just would absent herself. But if she was mad or hurt bysomeone that she loved, she was hurt where she couldn’t express her hurt.Again, she would absent herself, but in a different way. You could see the

hurt in her face. If she was mad at her boys, she wouldn’t punish them, butshe would, without intending to, show the hurt. And that of course affectedthem much more than giving them a smack on the behind.”

Think of others? Yes. Stu Crowner saw this when he worked with her on thescript for Gardens of the World. “I have tried to raise my kids with the idea ofconsidering the other person as much as you do yourself. For example, whenAudrey answered the phone, she said ‘Hel-lo! Hel-lo!’ Now, the reaction thatwould give the caller is, ‘Oh, she wants to hear from me!’ which is nuts, ofcourse, because she doesn’t know who is on the line. But it’s part of thatgenerosity of spirit. And she made you feel good, and she was doing that onpurpose. . . . Why does everyone say she had this regal stature? I think it hasto do with this generosity of spirit.”

Take the high road? Yes. Gregory Peck thought "Audrey definitely had agood heart, there was nothing mean or petty. She had a good character—shedidn’t have any of the backstabbing, grasping, petty, gossipy personalitiesthat you see in this business.” Janis Blackschleger, who produced Gardens ofthe World, the last television project that Audrey worked on, felt that“Audrey represents the better version of yourself—you never felt less forbeing in the room with her, you felt more.”

—AH to Peter Jennings, ABC News Person of the Week

Audrey loved her home. She loved being home. Perhaps because herHollywood life was so public and so demanding (she referred to it as “rathera circus”), and her childhood had been so tumultuous, but Audrey’s homelife, her private life, was deeply important to her. “I could survive withoutworking,” she once said, “but I couldn’t survive without my family. That iswhy my private life has always taken precedence.”

In 1965, Audrey bought a beautiful eighteenth-century stone farmhouse inTolochenaz, Switzerland, called La Paisible, “the place of peace.”Surrounded by an extensive orchard, vegetable, and cutting garden withmeadows edged in gray fieldstone, here, finally, was a place Audrey could beherself.

Not surprisingly, Audrey’s eight-bedroom home was a light, airy place,decorated for her enjoyment, not for a world-famous movie star. It wascarefully, perhaps sparely, furnished, and Audrey knew the history of eachpiece of furniture. Her decorating style was described by Audrey Wilder as“non fattening—just like Audrey.”

There were lots of flowers, white wicker furniture, bright paintings, andthe occasional Daumier sculpture in the large rooms, nothing heavy.According to Jeffrey Bilhuber—who is one of the top decorators in the worldand has worked with Hubert de Givenchy, Mariska Hargitay, Anne Bass,Iman and David Bowie, Peter Jennings, Anna Wintour, and others—“Thishouse is geared to work— the ladder-backed chairs in the dining room, thescrubbed surfaces, the white rattan chairs. But then you see baskets offlowers and clear material, that is an acknowledgment that you can havebeauty as an accompaniment to function.”

However one describes it, La Paisible was Audrey’s home, and she livedthere the rest of her life.

While there, her days were spent in the garden, the kitchen, or with friends

and family. She did not wear makeup at home, saying, “I hope you don’tmind—this is my time.” When she was not shooting, she rose about 7:00 a.m.and breakfasted lightly on a poached egg and whole wheat toast with jam.One of her favorite things was to feed buttered toast to her dogs.

Her gardens were her joy, and there was nothing she liked better than toput on a pair of jeans and muck about in the garden. Audrey loved flowers,and there were so many at La Paisible, it seemed that only she and GiovanniOrunescu, the gardener, could keep track of them all—hydrangeas, crocuses,daisies, dahlias, lily of the valley, and lavender to line the walkways.

At La Paisible, Audrey found her center. “Today there are so many people,so many things, so many emotions, and the more there is, the less I want. Themore man flies to the moon, the more I want to look at a tree. The more I livein the city, the more I search for a blade of grass.”

Jeffrey Bilhuber has his own take on Audrey’s private style. “Myimage of Audrey’s home is with her legs tucked under her and a bookand no makeup, in a very comfortable chair with a very good light, andI bet that was her favorite place to be— home. It wasn’t the red carpet,it probably wasn’t the film set! Home was more fun, and she probablyfelt more safe there.”

# FAMILY MATTERS

What was the main reason Audrey loved La Paisible, and worked to keep herprivate life so thoroughly out of the media? Her family.

# | Audrey as Daughter |

From all accounts, Audrey’s mother was a bit of a tough guy. According toRob, she was “a superior woman,” but “biased and intolerant and critical ofmost everyone, including Audrey.”

Ella van Heemstra was a baroness, and she liked people to know that shewas a baroness, which did not go over particularly well in America, and sortof galled her daughter, who was the most down-to-earth person in the world.Rob always felt that Audrey’s mother was proud of her daughter, and loved

her—she just couldn’t express it to her.

And Audrey, sensitive as she was, suffered for it.

Still, Audrey was exceedingly solicitous of her mother, knowing, on somelevel, that the sacrifices she made getting them both to London after the warhad kept the wolves from the door when Audrey was a struggling chorus girl.

Once Audrey had her great success, she took care of her mother. WhenGigi opened in New York, she wrote to a friend that she wanted to show hermother the town when she came to visit. Invited to stay at George Cukor’shome to attend the 1966 Oscars, she couldn’t wait to see him, but added thatif her mother could come down to see her from San Francisco (where shelived at the time), then the two of them would go stay at a hotel. 16For the lastten years of her life, the baroness lived with Audrey at La Paisible.

For whatever reason, Audrey’s mother and Mel Ferrer did not get along.Perhaps because they were both two strong-willed individuals, with Audreyin the middle. The baroness loved James Hanson, and considered him a verygood match for Audrey, but did not feel that way about Ferrer.17

And as we mentioned earlier, Audrey also took the time to repair thesituation with her estranged father (privately and away from the press) andvery quietly took care of him, too, throughout his life.

# | Audrey as Mom |

Audrey loved children—she had always loved children. As she said, “I wasborn with an enormous love of people, of children. I loved them when I waslittle! I used to embarrass my mother by trying to pick babies out of prams atthe market. The one thing I dreamed of in my life was to have children of myown.”

Audrey was, needless to say, practically the Best Mom Ever. She had gonethrough such struggles to become pregnant, enduring several heartbreakingmiscarriages. (Years later, when Sean was grown, she confided to him, “Thatwas the closest I came to feeling that I was going to lose my mind.”) LikeNancy Reagan and Sophia Loren, she was confined to bed rest for most ofher second pregnancy. When her two boys—Sean, in 1960, and Luca, in1970—were born, she was ecstatic.

As a mom, Audrey cared.

Her thoughtfulness for her friends and those she loved, her studiousnesswith UNICEF, movie scripts, and public speaking, her attention to detail, waslike nothing next to her love for her two boys.

When Sean or Luca had a test at school, she was practically more nervousthan they were. When Sean had a role in the Christmas pageant at the littleschool he attended in Tolochenaz, Audrey helped him with his lines. Whenshe wore a Spanish riding costume for a Vogue shoot, she had them rustle oneup for Sean, too.

Since she believed that her career had contributed to the demise of hermarriage to Mel, she more or less retired during her second marriage, toAndrea Dotti, and moved to Rome to devote herself to her family. In 1988,she recalled, “I had to make a choice at one point in my life, of missing filmsor missing my children. It was a very easy decision to make because I missedmy children so very much. When my elder son started going to school, Icould not take him with me anymore, so I stopped accepting pictures.”

As a mom, she had few rules. Manners were important, of course. And theboys were limited to a half hour of television a night, and one Coke a week.But other than that, Audrey wanted them to be happy.

# Audrey as Spouse |

While no one really knows what goes on between two people, particularly ahusband and wife, we do know that Audrey was an incredibly supportivespouse. Placing her trust as an actress in Mel once they married, andadvancing his career—and hers—as much as possible, she was also atraditional wife who created a beautiful home for him.

When she was married to Andrea, she stopped working to devote herself toher husband and children. Living in Rome as a doctor’s wife, she oftenbrought Andrea’s lunch to his office. She stayed in each of her marriages forfar longer than was (perhaps) good for her, for the sake of her children.

If nothing else, she gave each marriage her best shot.

# Audrey as In-Law |

“Low-key” was one way of describing Audrey’s place within the familialaxis. To the outside world, Hepburn was a star, but when she was home, shechecked her ego at the door.

When she was married to Dotti and living in Rome, she invited DominickDunne to her in-laws’ home for dinner. He recalls a scene where Audreyhappily played the low-maintenance daughter-in-law.

“We were invited to dine at Andrea’s mother’s house. And it’s a big Italianfamily, and the mother was a big Italian lady and had a lot of power abouther. I was a total outsider, passing the spaghetti and doing this and doing that.And Audrey was absolutely a part of it—and in that house, Mrs. Dotti wasthe queen. It’s not like Audrey was the movie star. Audrey and everyone elsethere absolutely deferred to her. And I thought, boy, if that’s not a lady, Idon’t know what is—and that’s instinct, that’s not what you learn in finishingschool.”

Interestingly, although she totally cut Mel out of her life after their divorce,she remained close with her in-laws. Mel’s sister Mary, for example,remained a friend for life.

# ’ Audrey as Godmother |

Can you imagine how fabulous that would be? The closet-raidingpossibilities alone leave one speechless. Not to mention what an excellentgift-giver she was.

Doris Brynner, then married to the actor Yul Brynner, lived just minutesfrom Audrey in Switzerland and was one of her closest friends. Audrey wasgodmother to her daughter, Victoria. As Victoria recalls, Audrey was not amere figurehead, but someone who “always gave incredibly sound advicewhenever I had problems with my parents or boyfriends or if I was scaredabout something.”

Audrey gave solid professional assistance, too. When Victoria was justbeginning her career as a photographer, Audrey invited her to shoot herUNICEF trip to El Salvador in 1989. Although she had been around Audreyall her life, it was the first time Victoria was with her in a professionalcapacity. Brynner recalls that “it was a great opportunity to watch her dealnot only with the suffering people in the field, but with all the UNICEF

officials, the governments, the media, constantly bouncing from one toanother.”

While there, they had a particularly wrenching visit to Quito’s mostpoverty stricken areas, and afterward, the two women visited the beautiful LaCompañía church. “We stood there next to each other and held hands andeach said her own little prayer,” Victoria recalled. “After what we’d just seen,it was very moving.”

A few months later, Audrey went to Victoria’s home for her birthday. As agift, she handed her a basket. In the basket was a bird’s nest Audrey hadfound in her garden, and in the bird’s nest, a little hand-painted paper bird,and under the bird was a cross set with diamonds and rubies. The card said itwas for that moment they had spent in the church in Quito.

Victoria has worn it every day since.

# MAKING A HOUSE A HOME

Style has nothing to do with money. It costs next to nothing to put a cachepeau of flowers on a table, or use pretty napkins at the dinner table. Whetherin her clothing choices, her reading choices, or decorating, AH mixed highand low with equal aplomb—she loved hot dogs for lunch at La Paisible, butalso had fresh green beans from the garden. You can do the same.

The main thing is that your home (like your wardrobe or accessories)should reflect your life. Your interests. And your history. Audrey’s taste levelwas so secure that you walked into La Paisible and you knew Audrey livedthere.

You can do the same for yourself. And don’t be afraid to show somepersonality—collect things from your travels and scatter them on the table forthe heck of it. . . . Just make sure they are small trinkets so they don’t obscureyour guests! At one memorable dinner, Diamond Jim Brady gave sandbuckets and shovels to his guests so they could dig for real jewels in asandbox. We’re not saying you need to go that far, but you get the idea.

Audrey loved fresh flowers throughout her house. She had a cuttinggarden, as well as an allée of sixty rosesbushes that Givenchy had planted tocelebrate her sixtieth birthday. (Nice!) So whether you live in a studioapartment or a 15,000-square-foot McMansion, you can easily use some of

Audrey’s advice and make your home lovely.

# | The AH At-Home Checklist

Music. Audrey liked all kinds of music—from jazz and David Sanborn toBach—so we know she would have had it brightening the halls at LaPaisible. Although the iPhone might have been too much technology for her—heck, it’s too much technology for us—knowing how much she lovedmusic, we have the feeling she would have had an iPod.

Scented candles. Audrey used the green Rigaud candle at home inSwitzerland, as did Pamela Harriman and the Kennedy women alike. For atime, Diana Vreeland’s exceptionally handsome husband, Reed, was the firstU.S. representative for this jet-set favorite. A perfect hostess gift, it comeswith a small travel size in a very chic zebra-striped tin.

Diptyque candles. Favored by writers Marina Rust, Amy Sedaris, and everychic Parisian we know. We like “Oranger,” but choose your favorite: Theylast forever. There is also Alora Ambiance scented sticks (which might soundstrange, but trust us, try these and you will become as addicted as SarahJessica Parker and Liv Tyler).

Personally, we love James de Givenchy for Taffin candles. Beautiful. Thebest. Track him down and try to persuade him to sell you a few—you’ll thankus.

Flowers. Move beyond the usual glass florist containers. Small Limogessugar and creamers make ideal vases. For the table, cut low bunches of thesame flower (or any greenery) and put them at either end or the center.

China. Audrey’s china was (of course) white. According to Rob, she hadrough country crockery for everyday use, and then the good stuff. WhileBaccarat and Tiffany & Co., or Limoges, can be the go-to place for crystaland silver, Williams-Sonoma has well-priced silverware and glassware, andyou won’t burst into tears if you accidentally drop something. CharlotteMoss’s shop in NYC is utterly di-vine, as AH would have said—perfect forgifts and housewares you won’t see everywhere else.

Herewith, the importance of setting a good table—which you know Audreyknew how to do. Whether hosting an outdoor luncheon for a children’sbirthday party or dining à deux with Rob on a snowy winter’s night, Audreydidn’t just wing it.

And if we need further inducement to sit and eat a proper meal,sociologists now tell us that families that eat dinner together have moresuccessful children, who get better grades, have greater self-confidence, andare less likely to abuse drugs or alcohol—probably because moms don’t missanything! (While Ron and Nancy Reagan were known for dining in front ofindividual TV tables at the White House, we stubbornly persist in followingthe example set by Audrey.) Besides, nutritionists believe that mindlesseating in front of the set is part of what has been leading to our country’srather astonishing weight gain.

Here is table-decorating advice from Robert Rufino, Vice President ofCreative Services/majordomo of Audrey’s favorite place in the word (cue thesoundtrack) . . . Tiffany’s.

It is always good to have a theme (or point of view), no matter how bigor small the occasion. And it is always nice for guests to come to a table witha surprise—whether it is a dinner party for eight or a quiet dinner for two.

Giving your guests little gifts always add fun to the night.

Begin with lush flowers. (Of course, little vases of flowers can work fora quiet dinner for two.) Buy roses early so they open. Full blown are betterthan buds. You do not always have to use flowers; a centerpiece can becreated by using some of your favorite objects on the table. Example: Useporcelain objects— dogs, dragons, etc. I have a collection of miniature bustsof different shapes and heights, which create drama on a beautiful black andwhite tablecloth. I also love using clever place cards.

From Robert, here are some themes for the various seasons:

For spring: Make a play with blue and white.

For summer: Work your table around shells.

For fall: Think harvest, using pumpkins, gourds, and autumn leaves fora centerpiece, and use a lush brown velvet tablecloth.

For the holidays: Go mad with layers of plaid.

And lastly, for a New Year’s celebration: Use a theme around Truman

Capote’s Black and White Ball—i.e., lush white flowers and an assortment ofblack and white candles of different heights. Give your guests black andwhite masks to wear and always, always use the best quality napkins, onesthat are starched and pressed.

# Iron Like a Star

Okay, we’re not saying you need to be able to iron your own shirts—well, okay, we are, because Audrey knew her way around an ironingboard. When she was shooting Gardens of the World, JanisBlackschlager said that AH was one of the most low-maintenance starsshe had ever worked with. Shunning the typical Oscar-worthy demandsof a cappuccino maker, her own gym, and all the red M&M’s pickedout of the bowl, she did her own hair and makeup, and only requested ahair dryer and an ironing board and iron in her hotel suite. When Janisarrived at AH’s door for the 5:00 a.m. call, she often found Audrey upand at ’em, standing at the ironing board, ironing whatever RalphLauren outfit she was planning to use that day.

So here goes.

For starters, it is always better to launder your clothing at home,since over dry-cleaning generally wears out your clothing. Instead, belike the Italians and air out your clothing after a big night rather thansending it out.

Now, about that shirt. Hardcore homebodies suggest hand-washingyour shirts in the sink. But since we are not Martha Stew-art, er, have alife, we launder the shirts in the washing machine and take them outand briefly hang them up to get some of the moisture out.

While it’s still damp, take the shirt, wrap it in plastic (a plasticgrocery bag is fine), and stick it in the fridge overnight to get cold. Thismakes the ironing even more effective.

Taking the shirt and, laying it on the board, use a hot iron and iron itin this order: collar, yoke and shoulder, cuff, then sleeve and body. Starton the left if you are right-handed, and the opposite side if you are left-handed. If you do not have steam, use a spray bottle to mist the shirt. If

your shirt is still a bit damp, use the “dry” setting.

Hang the shirt on a hanger and gently press the collar down withyour hands. Button the top two buttons to keep the nice, crisp fold.

And just think, hey—if it works for Audrey, I can at least try to irononce in a while. Your shirts will thank you, too.

# AH AND LES CHIENS

One cannot discuss La Paisible—or Audrey’s personal life—withoutdiscussing Audrey’s dogs. In addition to being one of the style setters of this(and practically any) century, Audrey was one of the great dog lovers of alltime.

“Who thinks you’re as fantastic as your dog does?” asked Audrey.

According to AH, practically no one. It was no surprise that when shemoved to Hollywood—that cruel intersection of appearance, ego, insecurity,and success—Audrey had a little dog, Famous. Famous was practically asfamous as his owner, accompanying her on film sets, while she got her hairdone, appearing in many an Avedon fashion shoot, even having a cameo inFunny Face.

Like many celebrities (well, except for Audrey), “Famey” was notparticularly well behaved: He peed on Audrey Wilder’s silk Louis XIV chairs(Audrey was mortified; Audrey Wilder thought it was hilarious). He waswildly jealous of Ip, the baby deer Audrey had to bond with in preparation forshooting Green Mansions, and acted out by hiding behind lamps and barkingmadly.

“You have to understand—Famous adored Audrey,” explained BobWilloughby. For a time, perhaps in danger of becoming the Judy Garland ofthe celebrity canine set, Famey was even prescribed doggy tranquilizers.

Still, Audrey loved him. She loved all dogs. In later life, after a successionof Yorkies, she would have no less than five Jack Russell terriers, amongthem Tupper, a gift from Audrey to Rob for his fiftieth birthday, because hehad never owned a dog. “My little hamburgers,” Audrey called them. Theyall slept in their mistress’s bed—Porthault sheets and all—because, asAudrey joked, she “couldn’t find a basket big enough for all five of us.”

In fact, Audrey and Rob disliked spending more than two weeks away

from home because they did not like to leave their dogs, and DominickDunne remembers being in a hotel suite with them as they called Switzerlandto check on a particular dog that was ill. With the possible exception ofOprah Winfrey, few celebrities love their dogs so absolutely as MissHepburn.

As she put it, “I think an animal, especially a dog, is possibly the purestexperience you can have. No person, and few children . . . are asunpremeditated, as understanding, really. They only ask to survive. Theywant to eat. They are totally dependent on you, and therefore completelyvulnerable. And this complete vulnerability is what enables you to open upyour heart completely, which you rarely do in a human being.”

# Invite Audrey into Your Home!

Here is some of Jeffrey Bilhuber’s advice on developing someAudrey Home Style.

1. Know Yourself. Audrey’s home was so successful because it wasa representation of who she was—you walked into that house and youknew: It was hers! You can do the same. Whether you live in afarmhouse or a city penthouse, make sure your home represents whoyou are, not what someone talked you into buying.

2. Have a vision. According to Bilhuber, “refinement is the message.Clarity. And clarity comes from a clear mind, it’s just that simple. It hasnothing to do with ‘I only like red, or I only like blue!’ It is knowingyour mind, being confident and competent in your decisions.”

3. Clear out the clutter. “Edit, edit, edit. I can’t say this enough. Tryto look at your space the way an editor (or a realtor) might. And don’tbe afraid to clear out the clutter and put it in storage. It will make yourspace look bigger, too.”

4. Flowers—indoors!—lots! Audrey loved fresh flowers, and nothingmakes a home more inviting than flowers. In the winter, you can have alarge bowl of oranges, lemons, or green apples to make a statement.

5. Beware of getting too matchy-matchy. Don’t buy furniture inwhole sets. You want the room to go together, but you don’t want it to

look prefabricated. Audrey knew her home so well that she could tellyou where each and every piece came from—and what you don’t wantis for every piece to come from the same place. That’s like ordering thesame thing for dinner for a month—too boring. More than anything,you want your home to reflect your personal taste, which, we arehoping, is not plain vanilla.

If you are not sure what to do, study design magazines to see a lookthat you like, or have a close friend whose taste you admire look at theroom and give an honest opinion.

6. Favorite things. When you travel, buy something—a postcard, aseashell, a souvenir—to remind you of that happy time. Create a smallgrouping of them on a mantel or side table.

# THE ART OF THE PERSONAL LETTER

In studying the finer points of star behavior, it seems clear that the well-timednote is what separates the truly well brought up from the arrivistes. SocialiteBabe Paley (like Princess Diana and Jackie O) sat down and wrote her breadand butter notes the night she came home from a dinner party orevent.18George H. W. Bush was famous for typing notes himself (on atypewriter, not a computer) to practically everyone he met, and this garneredhim a heck of a lot of goodwill across the political spectrum.

Thankfully for us, Audrey was a great letter writer, and many of her letterscan be found at the AMPAS Library in Beverly Hills. She favored bondedblue stationery with her current address—generally Switzerland or Spain—printed in smaller, darker blue ink in the top left corner. In her finishingschool script (an open, almost left-handed slant), she wrote pages upon pagesof her thoughts, travel plans, possible future projects, and daily routine todirectors William Wyler and Fred Zinnemann. She was democratic in hercorrespondence and, in later years, wrote to photographer Steven Meisel,hairstylist Garren, makeup artist Kevin Aucoin, designer (and friend) JeffreyBanks (often including photographs of one of her dogs), and Ellen Mirojnick,the costume designer for Always.

The point is that if AH could take the time to write, surely you can, too.

# The Specifics |

While some believe that modern conveniences like the cell phone, e-mail,and BlackBerry have made snail mail obsolete, we believe the opposite:Today, a personal note has even more impact, and will definitely separateyou from the crowd. Ladies, or gentlemen, if you want to impress yourpossible intended, send a typed love letter on business stationery to the office(making sure to scribble “personal” on the back flap). It is far more effectivethan sending flowers, and will last forever. Colin Cowie, Oprah’s favoriteparty planner, is a man who has style practically down to a science, and heleaves his personal stationery at the florist, wine shop, and chocolatier so thatwhen he sends a thank-you gift, they include a handwritten note on hisstationery.

We’re impressed.

As to the specifics, the note does not need to be long, but it should bedirected to the person you are writing to, and convey your personality.Remember that you (like Audrey) are memorable, so make your notes asindividual as possible, too. And in case you are wondering, AH signed herletters (to friends) “xx” or with a little sketch of a heart, and then her name.

# | The Finer Points

Any piece of paper will do, of course. But the social (and fashion) crowdfavors the four-by-six-inch flat card, with your name engraved across the top.If you have oversized, flamboyant handwriting, it should only take a sentenceor two to fill up the page, and with your name at the top—even if therecipient can’t read your hieroglyphics— they should be able to figure outthat you wrote some sort of a note thanking them for some sort of . . .something: perfect!

In L.A., the Chateau Marmont gives guests personalized stationery whenthey stay with them. A nice touch.

# HEALTHY LIVING AT HOME

“The only time to eat diet food is while you’re waiting for the steak to cook,”said Julia Child, which is something Audrey would probably agree with1,000 percent. While she ate lots of salads on the set in her glory days,between shoots she loosened up and enjoyed herself. (In 1953, meetingHedda Hopper for the first time, when HH comments on her “sensational”figure, Audrey shrugs it off, saying, “I’ve put on a little weight—on myholiday in England. When I’m not working, I put on weight.”)

“I am not a huge snacker, but I eat awfully well at meals and all thethings I like.”—AH

When Audrey was home and out of the public eye, what did she eat?

Audrey ate well. Like many of our European friends, she did not graze oreat between meals, but sat down and ate proper meals (china, silverware) atthe table. “I am not a snacker,” she said in 1992, “but I eat awfully well atmeals, and all the things I like.” You would never see Audrey at the foodcourt in a sweat suit with lettering on her backside, munching on aCinnabon.19

For the record (from her cook, her friends, and even photographers like

Bob Willoughby and Steven Meisel), Audrey loved to eat. But for the mostpart—let’s be honest here—she ate healthfully, and she’s wasn’t gorging onBig Macs and supersized soft drinks. “She’s disciplined, like all those balletdames,” was how Humphrey Bogart put it.

“I’m one of the lucky ones,” she said. “I seem to have a sort of built-inleveler. I’ve a tremendously good appetite—I eat everything, everything—butas soon as I’m satisfied, a little hatch closes and I stop.”

Like most women of her occupation, class, and generation, Audrey didn’teat a lot of junk food (for starters, it didn’t really exist then—certainly not inthe faux, corn syrup and sucrose laden way we know today). She loved pastawith marinara sauce or penne alla vodka, and fresh vegetables from thegardens at La Paisible—bright salads, string beans sautéed in olive oil, quicheon a bed of home-grown lettuce, something for dessert. She even loved hotdogs, one of her all-time favorites.

“I don’t like fancy food at all,” she admitted. “I much prefer an extremelysimple meal that’s exquisitely done . . . a perfectly cooked steak, a beautifulsalad, some raspberries.”

According to Florida Broadway, the cook Audrey hired when she was inLos Angeles shooting My Fair Lady and then brought to Switzerland to livewith her for two years, “For a tiny woman, she had an enormous appetite. Sheloved to eat, and they had all kinds of things with butter and cream. Theyliked chocolate soufflé, roast duck, rich things. Once, when Yul Brennercame to dinner, I made this roast duck and oh, you never heard such carryingon over duck in all your life.”

And when a cook was not around, Connie Wald said that “Audrey lovednothing better than to be in the kitchen with the children.”

Julie Leifermann, who traveled with Audrey for three months shootingGardens of the World, thought Audrey had a wonderful understanding ofproteins and carbohydrates, and of eating to give herself energy. Part of thiswas her experience in young adulthood. As Audrey remembered, “I livedthrough the war with very bad nutrition and found how tough it is to livewithout enough meat or vitamins or milk.”

With Audrey, there were few empty calories. “She ate a lot of fruit,”Leifermann remembers. “She ate fairly simply, because she didn’t want tobog herself down with huge meals, because we would be getting up early toshoot in the morning. When she was working or constantly traveling, her

instinct was to eat healthy, and eat the things that gave her energy, withoccasional indulgences here and there, but it wasn’t anything you’d reallynotice.”

Before it was popular or even on the radar of most Americans, Audrey ateorganically. At home, she ate good food of very high quality ingredients, andalthough many of us are starting to catch up with her, in this sense herinstinct was more European than American at the time. She was also “green.”At La Paisible, she grew corn, lettuce, tomatoes, tons of basil for her favoritepesto, as well as apples, cherries, pears, peaches. She even had walnut treesand hazelnut bushes.

Okay, while it’s pretty obvious from just looking at Audrey that she atewell—what about the fun stuff?

Like most of us, Audrey loved chocolate in any form. “Let’s face it, a nicecreamy chocolate cake has a lot for a lot of people; it does for me.” She oftenhad a square or two of dark baking chocolate in the afternoon. (And unlikemost of us, she could stop at just one square.) In Audrey’s early Hollywoodcareer, costume designer Edith Head was amazed at her ability to eat a hotfudge sundae or four éclairs at one sitting. With her neighbor Doris Brynner,she enjoyed vanilla ice cream with hot fudge on top. Sometimes, whenvisiting Los Angeles, she, Rob, and Connie used to go to the HamburgerHamlet on Sunset after catching a movie in Westwood. They always split theUltimate Hot Fudge Cake for dessert.

# | Now, About That Figure . . . |

And what—if anything—did she do to maintain her famous gamine figure?As an adult, Audrey was five feet seven inches, 110 pounds. Yes, she atewell. But part of it—probably most of it—was genetics. Audrey was just builtthe way she was built (she said that she looked exactly like her aunt). Nearlystarving during the war also permanently altered her metabolism. In addition,Audrey was always very physically active. While she never had a personaltrainer, set foot in a gym, or jogged around Central Park the way youraverage star would today, she loved to walk, and stretch, and took theoccasional dance class when she could.

“Exercise?” Audrey once said (in a comment that, once again, confirms

why she is our personal hero). “No, no. That’s too much like school. I like tobe free. There are too many musts in life without adding exercise.

“I’m totally unsporty,” she admitted. “I expect that comes from all thoseyears of dancing and making movies and not having the time. . . . I think ofmyself as an outdoors person, without being in the least athletic. I love towalk in the country—to be out in the clean air. I walk for miles by the sea. Iwalk in the sun.”

When she was home at La Paisible, after dinner she liked nothing betterthan to get outside and take the dogs for a walk through the countryside. Andthis was not just a stroll—Audrey moved. Asked by a friend why she walkedso fast, she said she thought it was in response to her mother, who walkedslowly.

A lot of Audrey’s appeal was simply her energy. As Steven Meisel orJeffrey Banks (or practically anyone who crossed her path) can attest, peoplejust liked being around her. “Her calm quality of purity and integrity is rare,”thought Cecil Beaton.

Once, when asked how she managed to stay so youthful-looking (which isreally just another form of energy), Audrey commented, “I’m just lucky.Healthy and lucky. It’s the way I was born, my physical makeup, my bonesor whatever. Let’s say that I don’t do anything in particular to live healthily,but I try not to live unhealthily. I know when I need sleep and try to get it. If Ifeel like eating pasta, I do, and I am a great pasta eater. But I don’t do onlythat. Some people go through life eating any old thing and then suddenly theyare exhausted and wonder why they are losing their figures.”

Like her waistline, her philosophy rarely changed. When asked in January1992 if she had any personal beauty secrets, Audrey said, “If I had them, I’dmake a fortune. But I know what helps—health, lots of sleep, lots of fresh air,and a lot of help from Estée Lauder.”

# Charlotte Moss on Bringing Audrey (into Your) Home

Charlotte Moss is an interior designer, best-selling author, andproduct creator who believes that “learning how to really live is alifelong process.” Some advice from a pro . . .

• Like Audrey, I can’t remember a time when I was not drawn tobeautiful things. I want to be surrounded by them at home and willalways be exploring what makes a home beautiful-gracious-delightful.

• One must never feel reluctant to experiment in their own home.Enthusiasm, curiosity, and determination with a dash of fearlessnesswill usually equate to something original.

• Your home reflects more than you know: Generosity and kindnessare the rugs; hospitality the furniture; curiosity the objects; andoriginality the placement . . . Enthusiasm, joy, and vitality are thefragrance that fills the air.

• Family photos, fresh flowers, happy music, a warm fire, andcomfortable chairs conveniently arranged . . . isn’t that the simpleformula that says “home”?

• Audrey’s self-confidence should inspire many. After all, how manygirls would admit—as Audrey did—that they’d rather have moreclosets than a swimming pool?

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Use a decorator? No. Although her cousin in style, Jacqueline KennedyOnassis, had some of the greatest decorators of the twentieth century passingthrough 1040 Fifth Avenue (and sometimes tried to avoid paying them bywriting a personal check because she knew they would not cash it), Audrey’sstyle was all her own. She used designer patterns to cover the softfurnishings. She mixed first-class artwork (among them, a small Daumierbronze) with wide, white couches, lots of flowers brought indoors, and silver-framed pictures of family and friends lining the tabletops. Not surprisingly,although there were dozens of silver-framed pictures of children, friends, andfamily, there was only one lone photograph of Audrey—a signed CecilBeaton portrait of her in My Fair Lady, tucked behind all the others.

And she loved the color white. Here’s a tip: If you want to bring someAudrey Style into your domain, don’t think pink—think white!

Give career advice to her children? Not really, but she did give Sean adviceon learning his lines for a school play.

When Sean was about twelve, he was going to be in a school play, acting

out Le Malade imaginaire, by Molière, a famously difficult—but funny—monologue by a hypochondriac, and Sean was concerned about learning hislines.

Audrey told him, “Just read it. Don’t try to learn it.” Later, she advisedhim, “This is what I do—I read my lines right before I turn the lights off atnight and then again when I open my eyes in the morning.”

“That’s it?” he asked.

“That’s it.”

Let the dogs on the furniture? Come on, you know she would— heck, she letthem sleep in the bed with her, designer sheets be damned. In a mild nod topracticality, she had the couches in the den covered in a rough pink nubbypattern to hide some of the wear and tear.

Know how to run a house? Yes. And the gardens outside.

Have help? Yes. Audrey had a cook when she was married to Mel, ahousekeeper, a nanny when her boys were small, and a gardener/ outsideman. Giovanna, her housekeeper, stayed with her for forty years and wastruly a part of the family. Audrey took great pride in her home, loved to cookand more often than not prepared the food for her own luncheons and dinnerparties herself, was an extensive gardener, and arranged all of the flowers.

Pimp out the kids? No way. Bob Willoughby remembers Audrey as “a greatmother, very protective. She never wanted Sean to be photographed forrelease. She had the fear that a lot of famous people had about kidnappers,particularly in Europe. She brought Sean to the set of The Children’s Hourand I promised they wouldn’t be used in the magazine. . . . I kept them untilhe was grown.”

Take a nap? Yes, when she could. Although it was never possible(obviously) during the big shoots for My Fair Lady, Breakfast at Tiffany’s,Funny Face, etc., once AH retired, she got up early and got going in themorning, a holdover from her filmmaking days, as Connie Waldremembered. But when she could, she would duck in and take a short nap inthe afternoon. She also did this during the shooting of Gardens of the World.Since the light is best in the morning and late afternoon (the “magic hours,”in filmmaker’s terms), Audrey took a break at midday.

Like to swim? Curiously, Audrey loved swimming but had a morbid fear ofgetting her head wet. She never knew the reason why, really, but Rob thinksit might have been because her two older brothers might have dunked her

sometime when she was a girl.

Drive? No. Audrey did not like to drive, leaving it instead to a studio driver(when making a movie), Rob, or her gardener. On July 14, 1958, heading tothe studio to begin shooting Green Mansions, she was involved in a fenderbender at the intersection of Beverly Drive and Santa Monica Boulevard.When the woman she accidentally rear-ended, an aspiring actress by thename of Joan Lora, learned who she was, she sued Audrey, claiming she hadsuffered neck and back injuries.

Mel, being resourceful, hired detectives to follow the woman, and whenthe case came to trial two years later, they saw that Ms. Lora was not injuredafter all, and the case was dismissed.

The whole incident left Audrey so shaken that she rarely drove again.Shop on the Internet? She probably would have, within reason.

Audrey was not a huge techno-junkie. Although she did not live to see theexplosive rise of the Internet and the enormous cultural changes it hasafforded, she thought cell phones (then in their nascent form— think:Michael Douglas talking on a shoebox-sized phone while walking on thebeach in Wall Street) were intrusive and did not like portable phones at homein Switzerland.

According to Connie Wald, “Audrey liked to shop, but she didn’t shopshop the way some women do for entertainment.” But once she got the hangof it, we think she might have liked some of the following sites.

(their magazine, BG is beautiful)

(Where Jeffrey Bilhuber gets the white wickerfurniture à la Audrey that we know you now want)

Bring her work home? No. As Sean recalls, "We weren’t a film buff family.She didn’t bring it home. She didn’t talk about it. She didn’t sit there andshow us the movies.”

Have a hobby? Not in the traditional sense. Audrey did not golf, play tennis,ski, go sailing, or ride horses. That said, she loved to read, listen to music,have friends over, garden, and sketch (just not at the same time). Once, whenasked by an interviewer if she had any hobbies, she replied, “Not really. I

don’t collect things. I sketch—but not at all well.20I should like to have morerecords than I do. I played the violin at seven years. I haven’t had time forhobbies. I really worked. That’s the trouble. I led a secluded life.”

Love children and dogs? Yes—in the adorable versus vulnerable ratio, babiesand puppies were perhaps the only things on the planet that could possiblymatch Miss H.

GO green? Absolutely. Because of her experiences during the war, Audreywas an early proponent of eating fresh, healthy foods. La Paisible was alsopractically a self-sustaining farm. And Audrey definitely would have stockedup on eco-friendly lightbulbs at Home Depot or .

Live in a big city? No, and alas, this is our loss. As much as we love theimage of Audrey as Holly Golightly wafting up the stairs of her New YorkCity brownstone, the effects of the war and her childhood, and perhaps hercelebrity, stayed with her. She once admitted that she “hates anything thatcrowds me” and counted her long walks alone in the country near hersecluded Swiss villa among the “joys of life” and went there as often aspossible.

# chapter 5

# On the Road

"I live out of a suitcase.”

—AH

As a world-famous actress, Audrey spent a tremendous amount of timetraveling all over the world to film sets. This chapter is life on the road . . .whether it be another city, away for the weekend, or hightailing it to Paris forthree months. In her glory days, Audrey was not a minimalist. She did nottravel light. She did not wear flip-flops or shorts on an airplane or—godforbid—lug a full-sized pillow into the coach section. No, as someone whobrought fifty-two suitcases with her when she traveled to her next film set(along with a typed, numbered listing of the contents of every case so shecould find Mel’s cufflinks in an instant), Audrey believed that you can take itwith you—and she did.

And for the record, when the studios were paying, Audrey went first class,natch. In later years, she occasionally hitched a ride on Ralph Lauren’s orAnne Cox Chambers’s private jet. But according to her son Sean, Audreygenerally rode coach to save money on her UNICEF trips. So if she couldmake do in steerage without bitching about it, so can you.

Travel used to be glamorous. Travel used to be fun. Possibly because itwas so expensive and so few people actually got on a plane (hence the term“jet set”), there was something inherently romantic about airplane travel. Oneonly needs to visit the Louis Vuitton Museum in Paris, or know that Pradastarted out as a luggage maker in Italy, to know that travel used to beexciting.

To cite one example, at the end of a film shoot, Bill Holden, who, granted,had a pretty bad marriage, carried thousands of dollars’ worth of traveler’schecks (ask your parents: This was pre-credit cards), and he would walk up tothe counter and buy a ticket and get on a plane to Africa. Or Paris. Oranywhere. And just split.

Sounds great, doesn’t it?

In the old days, you could smoke and drink and enjoy Chateaubriand with

impunity on airplanes—heck, it was almost encouraged. Remember the scenein Two for the Road, when Audrey almost gets into an argument with herhusband, played by Albert Finney, because he won’t buy her a pack of cigs toenjoy in first class (and this is on an airplane, not in a nightclub, mind you)?Classic.

When Diana Vreeland traveled, she carried a Vuitton hard-sided makeupcase, specially outfitted with a dozen small bottles of Stolichnaya, as well aslemons, limes, and a small knife to cut the citrus with. Now, that’s traveling.

Nowadays, you can barely carry a lipstick or a pack of gum onboardwithout getting frisked down by an overzealous TSA employee. While youused to be able to carry a tall bottle of Evian onboard and look like a realworld traveler, today you can’t bring any liquids onboard . . . save the $\$ 4.00$midget bottle of water you bought in the concourse.

Still, we must do the best that we can, and herewith are some tips tomaintain your own state of Audrey Equanimity.

# FIRST-CLASS TRAVEL STYLE

Whether traveling private, first class, business, or coach, here is someAudrey-inspired advice to maintain your own personal aura of firstclass style.

# | Preflight

Ordering meals. When you book your flight, if they offer a meal (a big ifthese days) and you are in coach or business, order vegetarian or Kosher,even if you are not, as they will have to make your meal fresh and there willbe a better chance at eating healthfully if you get fruit or a salad, or wholegrains.

Get a manicure/pedicure. Face it, if you are going to have to take your shoesoff before you pass through security, you want your feet looking sharp! Youknow Audrey would have. And did.

Airline lounges. If you travel first class, you automatically get access. If youtravel a good deal on coach, consider joining the lounges of the variousairlines 21so you have somewhere nice to hang out when waiting for your

flight, with great reading material, fresh food, and comfy chairs (as opposedto, say, Starbucks, or sitting on the floor in the waiting area), especiallyconsidering the endless flight delays we experience today. If you are reallystuck on a layover and feeling indulgent, many will let you join for the dayfor a nominal fee.

# Packing Tips

• First of all—and we are sure this sounds rudimentary— make a list ofthe different events you have, and what you might wear to each. Afteryou have been traveling (and packing) for a while, you can do thismentally, but in the beginning, make a list so that you don’t forget avital item— like the shoes or accessories that go with a certain outfit.

• Depending on how much luggage you want to bring, and where youare going (Nepal? Los Angeles? Is it business? Your honeymoon?), youmight want to pare down the list (very un-Audrey), or just bring prettymuch everything with you.

• If it is just a weekend, or a few days away, you can use a duffel, butfor anything close to a week, we like a large, soft-sided suitcase so thatyou can bring everything you need and still lay your clothes flat. If youare going on a longer trip, or to Europe, you can bring a second duffelto put running shoes, hair dryer (if you need to bring it), odds and ends,etc. But in general, if you get one good-sized suitcase, you should beable to get everything in there.

• Here’s an old-school tip: tissue paper! Lots of tissue paper! Somepeople say that you should pack your clothing in dry-cleaning bags tokeep them wrinkle free, but unless you have a very special outfit thatyou are worried about getting messed up, this seems more bother than itis worth. Just lay everything as flat as possible, with the heavier itemsjeans, blazers, suits—at the bottom of the case, and shoes along thesides. We generally don’t use tissue (although our grandmother did)unless we are bringing some sort of special couture or evening gown tosome gig, say, in London.

• People who travel a good deal have doubles of makeup and toiletries

packed and ready to go for when they have to hit the road. If you packthe night before, this gives everything time to settle, and the nextmorning, you can put even more things into your bag.

• Modern fashionistas, and people who travel a lot, swear by the ziplockbag (small and large sizes). Put your lingerie and bathing suits inseparate bags, squeeze the air out, and close them, to keep them easy toretrieve.

• For toiletries, separate your larger bottles from non-liquid and put inplastic bags. And one lifesaving tip from our travel-savvy friends: Ifyou are completely type A, or have someone packing for you, transferyour liquids to smaller, reusable containers (you can get them at placeslike the Container Store). Otherwise, open the lids and squeeze the airout of your toiletries, then close them. They will look sort of squished,but there is something about letting the air out that causes them not toexplode in-flight and ruin your clothing. And your life.

• Places like Louis Vuitton and T. Anthony still sell separate shoecarriers. Very good in theory, if you have the space and the inclination.To save on space, you could tuck your socks in your shoes (if you wearthem these days; very few fashionistas do).

• Invest in decent luggage.22In her heyday, Audrey had a set of LouisVuitton (that Rob Wolders believes must have been given to her by thecompany). Jerry Hall keeps her lingerie in an LV hat box and carriesthat on board. In her later years, Audrey used two large canvas suitcasesthat Rob had picked up in London.

Be a good tipster. And we don’t mean e-mailing Us Weekly about a celebsighting at LAX. Keep a few singles or a five-dollar bill in an outside pocketso you can reach it quickly to tip the check-in guy, etc.

Finally, we generally check our suitcase at the curb so we don’t have to lugit around the terminal, and just have our carry-on bag. Although we havefriends who swear by Never Checking In And Carrying Your Stuff On Board,we only know men who do this, as they do not have theshoe/lingerie/maquillage issue.

Also, use one of those specially approved locks (you can get them at placeslike Brookstone), so that the TSA can open your bag and inspect it, in casethey have to.

# In Flight

Dress, for god’s sake! If there’s a time to ask yourself WWAD?, boy, this isit—AH always dressed. We’re not saying show up like you’re going to adinner party, but a neat pair of jeans and white shirt and a well-cut blazer orcardigan will go far.

As an editorial observation, we do not understand people who get onairplanes as if they are going to the beach—shorts, exposed midriff,practically barefoot—if for no other reason than how do you expect to betaken seriously? And not to get paranoid, but if something happens and youneed to evacuate, you want to be covered. Besides, they tend to crank the ACin airports and on planes, so if you don’t dress properly, you are going tofreeze the entire time.

And although it is unlikely that any student of Audrey’s would need thisadvice, please keep in mind that gym wear belongs in the gym. The first timewe went to Paris (admittedly, years ago), we were dumbfounded at the hordesof American tourists in matching warm-up suits, T-shirts, and windbreakers,marching in lockstep down the Champs-Élysées. While it might work in yourhometown (it might even be a look in your hometown), if for no other reasonthan national pride, please, leave it home.

If you must wear sneakers, think Keds or trim Euro-style Adidas, notclunky running shoes. Personally, we prefer leather shoes for comfort andstyle, to say nothing of the fact that airport personnel will take you moreseriously and, possibly, bump you up a class.

And finally, ladies (or gentlemen): If for no other reason than travel isinherently romantic, and you might meet someone special, it behooves you todress properly, and if you need further encouragement, simply ask yourself,What would Audrey do? (And act accordingly.)

# | In-Flight Necessities |

Bose headphones. Hear that chorus of angels singing? Whether you buy theoriginal or a copy, Bose is a lifesaver for any sort of public transportation.We don’t mean to be antisocial (well, okay, sometimes we do), but put it onat the first outburst of a howling baby or your too chatty seatmate, and the

noise of the outside world disappears. Every road warrior we know owns one.iPod. If AH had one of these, she probably would have enjoyed listening toher favorite jazz.

Something to read. Audrey read Graham Greene and Jeffrey Archer forrelaxation. When traveling abroad, a friend we know buys the latesthardcover biography that has not yet been published overseas, reads it on theflight over, and hands it off to the purser on his way off the plane. Now,that’s style.

Or you can always settle for the latest issue of Vanity Fair.

Something to eat. A turkey sandwich with mustard and lettuce on wholewheat, some almonds, an apple, or an orange. We have heard that DonnaKaran eats nothing in-flight, and brings her own black mug, which she handsto the stewardess to keep filled with hot water and lemon slices. That isadmirable, but let’s be honest: On a long flight to the coast, we needsomething to look forward to.

Besides, we sat next to a supermodel recently, and she brought on her ownlarge salad with chicken slices (bought in the airport). She ate that, and thenhad bits of the first-class meal—the fresh fruit, the ice-cream sundae withchocolate sauce for dessert, and seconds. She then shared her copies of Us,InStyle, Time, and People with us, so not only was she beautiful (and aboutsix feet two), she was also Audrey Cool.

Cashmere Wrap. Or a small cashmere blanket with fringes, not a pashmina.Every model and fashion editor we know carries one onboard. If you aretrolling for a Christmas gift or have just won the lottery, Hermès makes one,while Brora in London makes a slightly more affordable version. Audreyalways had one throughout the years to keep her cozy on film sets andairplanes. (For the true Audrey-philes who must know, her wrap in later yearswas navy.)

Porthault pillow. One Best Dressed Lister we know brings a small Porthaultpillow onboard to rest her head upon. So chic!

On the other hand, if this is overkill and you need to edit, go for the Bose,the iPod, something to read, and the cashmere wrap.

Notebook. For the Great American Novel you are working on. After years ofusing everything from the green-marbled school notebook to beauties fromPapiro in Florence, we swear by Moleskin. Favored by van Gogh, Matisse,Hemingway, and Sean Penn, as well as every screenwriter, director, and art

director we know, they also make great hostess gifts.

Meds. We have no problem flying—we actually enjoy it—and Audrey neverhad a problem, either; in fact, she used her downtime on airplanes to writelove letters. But we have a few friends who don’t, and they tend to pop a fewExcedrin PMs (or something stronger) so they can sleep through it all.

That being said, germs seem to be the big thing on planes, and some folksswear that if you drink some Airborne before you fly, and again when youland, you won’t catch a cold. And while we would not know fromexperience, the vitamin-laden Airborne is also said (by Oprah Winfrey andothers) to help with hangovers.

The fashion tribe swears by Emergen-C, those chic little packets you get inthe health food store, while makeup maven Bobbi Brown favors DavidKirsch’s vitamin/mineral powder. (Please note: This is not to impart anymedical advice, and all of these OTC cure-alls must be dissolved in waterbefore drinking. You’ll love the cute fizz.)

Oh, and something else we’ve heard from people who fly a lot who aremildly germ phobic: Whether in first class or back in steerage—whatever youdo, do not order ice in your drink.

Meditate. Or close your eyes and just breathe. Take advantage of the factthat you are miles away from your everyday life, and no one can find you.

Work on your hobby. Georgia O’Keeffe had never flown on an airplane untilshe was in her late sixties. She was fascinated by the very act of flying, andso moved by the experience that she pulled out her watercolors and beganpainting studies of what became her memorable Above the Clouds series.

If possible, be like Audrey and try to maintain some of that childlikewonder of the romance of travel. You’ll be a better person for it.

Fly private. We used to date a guy who, no kidding, flew his own jet. It wascool, and it’s amazing how quickly you get used to it.

In her later years, Audrey and Rob were invited to fly with Ralph Laurenand a group of friends to Lauren’s home in Jamaica, on his plane. When theygot there, the women were dressed the way they would have been in the1940s and ’50s—with suits, and even hats! Rob laughed at the memory. “Inpart, because Audrey would be there, out of respect for her, I suppose. Andthere would be Audrey in jeans and a polo shirt, but she always had a well-cut blazer so that she always looked extremely elegant.”

But the great thing about flying private (besides the obvious luxe, calme et

volupté aspect of the whole thing) is that you can bring anything you wantonboard, and no one cares. Several trunks containing your entire winterwardrobe? No problem! A gas grill, fireworks, fiftypound sacks of rice, aShetland pony? 23Sure!

When flying private, all we can say is: Act as if this is no biggie. “Are weleaving from Teterboro/Butler/Montrose?” is an acceptable question. “Wow—is this yours?” is not. Most of all, be low-key. Act like you’ve done thisbefore. Pretend you’re getting on a crosstown bus (which you are, sort of).

Yes, the ultrasuede lining the walls of the cabin is cool, as is the low vaseof Dutch tulips and freesia on the sideboard (a sideboard?), and often there isa steward to get you a fruit tray, the Wall Street Journal, or some Perrier.Which, given global warming and all, seems like an extreme waste of, well,pretty much everything. But you can just put your feet up and relax in yourleather chair, read The New York Times in peace, thinking of Audrey, andponder your fortunate life.

# | L’hotel—Once You’ve Arrived |

Charm the front desk. In case you are wondering, staffers who rememberAudrey staying at the Hotel Plaza Athénée still miss her. We’re not sayingyou need to bug the GM, but make friends with the front desk when youcheck in . . . in case you need something later on.

Watch the Jim Morrison behavior. We have a friend who is a concierge at theFour Seasons (Oscar Central in L.A.), and he asks everyone to remember thathotels have cameras in all of the elevators, hallways, and stairwells. He alsotold us some amazing backstage gossip about a movie star and her volatilerapper boyfriend who showed up unexpectedly, and the man she eventuallymarried dashing down the back staircase, struggling to get his trousers onbefore the other guy found him and killed him. But that’s all we’re saying. . .

Many people, apparently, check into a hotel and undergo some sort ofexpense account mania. Whether because of that, or the lack of proximity tohome base, they go off the deep end. “They act like they’re on anotherplanet,” Mr. High End Concierge says wonderingly, “like they’ve never

stayed in a hotel before.” Trust us: Management knows exactly (well, prettymuch) what you are up to. “The only place we don’t have cameras,” he wantsus all to know, “is in the rooms themselves. That would be illegal.”

Audrey, needless to say, never had this sort of behavioral problem. Ever.She walked out of her front door, every day, as if she were walking down ared carpet. Even if it was just in sneaks and a pair of jeans to walk the dog.

Rearrange your room! Nothing says star behavior like rearranging your hotelroom the way you like it. Elvis Presley had a prescribed ritual (well, hisminions had a prescribed ritual). Check into the biggest suite on the strip, turnon the television set, put his current reading material on the nightstand, crankthe AC, and have the blackout drapes drawn (and, if need be, line thewindows with tinfoil to block out the light).

Now, Audrey did none of these things, but since she often found herselfliving in hotel suites for months at a time, she took the time to make thingsmore livable. When she was married to Mel and staying at the Hotel Raphaelin Paris, for example (also one of Natalie Portman’s favorite places),management knew to take her things out of storage and rearrange the roomsthe way she liked them. So the entire suite was transformed to their taste withtheir own pictures, rugs, table lamps, bed linens, vases, cushions, silverware,crystal, tablecloths, decanters, and even Audrey’s favorite white Limogesashtrays.

Audrey’s memory was so exact that one time after she checked in, shecalled the front desk and wondered about a particular little side table.

“In another suite,” she was told.

Would it be possible to return it to her room? And then suggested where itmight be placed.

Of course.

# A Room of One’s Own

When you are on the road, personalize your room with framed pictures ofyour family or friends (or your pooch!) to remind you of them while you arethere.

Clean out the refrigerator and have them cart away the mini bar—too muchsugar/alcohol-induced temptation.

Light a scented candle. Have them remove the ashtrays if they bother you.

Bring your own iPod. Most hotels have speakers so that you can listen toyour own music.

If you are uncertain about the amenities of a hotel, bring your own bathgel. Kiehl’s or Vitabath makes some great stuff.

While the Duke and Duchess of Windsor traveled with their own bedlinens and pillows, as did Babe Paley, we’re not saying you have to go thisfar. Besides, part of the fun of staying in a really great hotel is scoping out thebed. (And you might get some ideas about upgrading your own bedroom athome.)

When you arrive at your destination and don’t feel like ironing, try thistraveler’s trick: Hang your clothing in the bathroom and crank the shower onhigh to get the room all hot and steamy (obviously be careful to hang youroutfit so it does not get wet). Close the door and leave the shower running forabout five minutes. Go in and turn the water off, quickly get out and shut thedoor, and let your clothing hang there for about half an hour. You might nothave to iron at all.

# | Something Very Cool to Keep in Mind |

Audrey was essentially a private person, and somewhat shy, and perhapsfrightened, at times, by all that was expected of her, and yet she got out there(meaning, the world) and acted, and tried, and created something that livesbeyond her, even today, a generation after her death. So we will say this: Ifyou have the chance to travel, to contribute, to improve someone’s life inwhatever small (or large) way, to go off to see the world, to ride a Vespa inRome, or enjoy an ice-cream cone in the Tuileries one bright afternoon . . .

Go—Audrey would encourage us today.

Through the creative actions of her life, and the courage she had to movebeyond her privileged upbringing, Audrey shared herself with the world andlived a big, gracious life, enjoying lifelong friendships with Gregory Peck,Cary Grant, Hubert de Givenchy, Fred Astaire, James Garner, Sean Connery,Ralph Lauren, Jeffrey Banks, and hundreds of people whose names we maynever know—but who met her once, and never forgot it.

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Fire the posse? Yes. Audrey was a fairly solitary person. She had herhusbands, and the boys, of course. And she was close to her mother her entirelife, and Hubert de Givenchy, and a few close girlfriends, and later, Rob. ButAudrey was not a wreckin’ crew kind of gal. Perhaps because her life was sopublic, she admitted to enjoying being alone sometimes.

Be practical? Yes. Audrey was surprisingly practical. A friend rememberedher as being able to fix leaky faucets, to replace fuses and even fix taperecorders that had malfunctioned. If she was planning a trip, she bought hertickets well in advance, and it was not surprising that she kept such orderedlists of her travel necessities.

Talk to the person in the seat next to her? Yes. Well, actually, the person inthe seat next to her would probably speak to her first.

Brown-bag it? Yes. And not only for herself—for friends, too. In 1989,Leendert de Jong, programmer of the Dutch film festival “Film and Fashion”(which had honored Audrey), and a friend visited her. After spending a fewdays with her and Rob, it was time for them to leave, and Audrey asked themwhat they would like for lunch to take with them. De Jong and his friendprotested, they didn’t need anything, but Audrey insisted—what did theywant on their bread? One wanted cheese and butter on his sandwich, the otherplain cheese.

On their way out the door, Audrey handed them two small Chanelshopping bags as they kissed her and said good-bye. Halfway to Venice, theystopped and opened their bags. Inside was a picnic lunch with real glassesand two slips of paper—one with de Jong’s name on it, and one with hisfriend’s.

With butter, and without.

# chapter 6

“A Very Stylish Girl . . .”

"How do I look?”

—AH as Holly Golightly, Breakfast at Tiffany’s

Audrey was known for her Style and her beauty, and that certain je ne saisquoi that made her a movie star. In this chapter, we really get into it, a how-toprimer on what made Audrey the icon she still is today: fashion, makeup,accessories, her closet and yours.

Audrey wore jeans, exercised (a bit, but nowhere near Jane Fonda’smania), always looked amazing, and had very definite opinions about whatshe would and wouldn’t wear. And now, so can you.

Here, we explore how to get the look, including: the importance of thebrow; how to make up for your lack of a twenty-inch waist; education andcultural interests as aphrodisiac; the exceedingly effective smoking andexercise weight-loss program. It’s all here: style lessons from the most stylishwoman in the world—and what would surprise us to know about her.

# AUDREY’S TAKE ON AUDREY

And what did Audrey think of her looks? Believe it or not, she was self-conscious about her upper arms (she thought they were too thin) and her feet(too large). In an extremely revealing 1953 interview with Hedda Hopper, sheadmits, “I’ve always wanted really feminine shoulders that sort of slopedown.” “Come on,” said Hedda Hopper (rightly so), “you have terrificshoulders.”

“I swear to you that’s true. Ask my mother. She’s heard it enough. I’vealways wanted sloping shoulders.”

“You mean like the southern belles?”

“That’s right—crinoline and all.”

Which proves, we suppose, that even the most beautiful women in theworld have the capacity to obsess over the most nonexistent things.

“I don’t think I’m at all beautiful,” Audrey continued, a luminous twenty-

four years old, with Roman Holiday weeks away from being released, “andI’m not fishing. I mean it.”

We have a really difficult time believing this. But Rob Wolders (and hewould know, we suppose) said that Audrey “was almost like a child in thatshe refused to believe how good she looked. She was extraordinarily modest .. . and it wasn’t a kind of false modesty.”

# THE A(H) LIST

# “All style is personal—that’s what distinguishes it from fashion.” —Fran Lebowitz

You want Audrey-esque? We’ve got Audrey-esque. Finally, the soup-to-nuts(or gamine haircut to ballet flats) primer on All Things Audrey. We’re notpromising you’ll find your own Gregory Peck, but follow these tips and youjust might make it to the Best Dressed Hall of Fame.

Make the most of your assets, Underplay your flaws. In Love in theAfternoon, Audrey mock-complains to Gary Cooper, “I’m too thin and myears stick out, my teeth are crooked and my neck’s much too long.” “Maybeso,” Cooper replies, “but I love the way it all hangs together.” So studyyourself and make the most of your assets.

For example, while Audrey was self-conscious about her size-ten feet, shehad no problem cinching her twenty-two-inch waist. Everyone’s gotsomething wonderful to emphasize—highlight it and ignore the rest.

Have a POV. Whether a movie director, a style icon, or just disagreeing witheverything Ann Coulter says on television, it helps to have a strong point ofview. In terms of fashion, find what works for you and stick with it. Even as astruggling chorus girl in London in 1945, Audrey (who could do more with aplain white shirt than anyone) knew what worked for her and what didn’t.

Encourage your mania. Do you love clothes? Fine, don’t apologize. In aworld with far too many Casual Fridays (and for the men, this translates intothe dreaded chino, golf shirt, and Top-Sider combo), look at it this way: Youare injecting some verve (to quote Diana Vreeland) into the world. “Clothesare positively a passion with me,” said Audrey, who we know traveled withno fewer than a dozen suitcases in her glory days. “I love clothes so muchwhere it is practically a vice.” And also: “Some people dream of having a big

swimming pool—with me, it’s closets.”

And don’t think people won’t notice if you make the effort. As early as1954, Cecil Beaton noted in Vogue, Audrey “is immaculately shod, whetherin pumps, sandals or court shoes.”

Her style was subtle, not obvious. “She was the first to make something that’snot sexy, sexy,” says Cynthia Rowley. With apologies to all the PamelaAndersons and Paris Hiltons of the world, and an entire subset of UGG-loving, lingerie-revealing (or non-lingerie-revealing) Hollywood actresses,don’t be afraid to tone it down a little.

Disregard trends. Audrey was unique in her style choices in that she knewwhat was going on in fashion, but did not follow trends. Instead, she decided,early on, what worked for her and moved within those parameters. That said,she never got stuck in a look: Ballet flats gave way to Ferragamo and RogerVivier, which gave way to Keds and probably would have led to ManoloBlahnik, had he been designing when she was alive.

And although there was always a very distinctive Audrey look, she nevergot stuck in one decade. She knew when to put away the perfect Givenchysuits of the 1960s and rock out the pea coat, trim jeans, and biker boots of the1970s.

Good grooming. Oh Lord, don’t get editor Candy Pratts Price—who hasbefriended, worked with, and socialized with some of the most famoustrendsetters in the world—started on grooming and style . . . but she is right,you know.

“It’s maintenance—grooming is key. Grooming is key! Today you can geta manicure and a pedicure—Audrey was groomed! And you know who looksthe same way today—Christy Turlington—you know that Christy Turlingtontakes care of her eyebrows. People don’t think that matters, but it does! Andwhen you look at Audrey, it was very significant.”

“To be natural is a very difficult pose to keep up.” —Oscar Wilde

# Audrey-esque Makeup Tips

Audrey was known for her distinctive makeup that highlighted hermemorable eyes. What many people don’t know is that she worked

with the same makeup and hair team (whom she met on RomanHoliday) her entire life: the married couple Alberto and Grazia DeRossi. What they also might not know is that Alberto was so exactingthat after applying mascara, he used a safety pin to separate each of hereyelashes to get it right. (A somewhat daunting style tip that JuliaRoberts recently used in a movie scene to great effect.)

# “A girl can’t read without her lipstick.” —AH as Holly Golightly, inBreakfast at Tiffany’s

We are about to make your life a little easier. Thanks to Darac, theformer Director of Artistic Development of Estée Lauder, who now hashis own makeup line (and has worked with Cher, Princess Diana,Claudia Schiffer, Evelyn Lauder, and a host of others), he is going toshow us how to get some AH magic for ourselves, makeup-wise.

In Darac’s opinion, “Audrey’s makeup got better and better andbetter. It’s not like she had one look and kept it for forty years. Somewomen get the aqua blue eye shadow going in seventh grade and juststick with it! She also did something very smart—she focused herfeatures. She never tried to make herself something that she wasn’t, sheworked with the natural beauty that God gave her . . . which issomething we can all learn from today.”

# Eyes

You have a choice: You can play up your eyes or your lips, never both.You have to make a choice.

Start with mascara and put on one coat.

Then put on an eye shadow color that comes closest to your naturalskin color, all the way from the lid to the brow to get a nice, even plane.If you start with a color that is too dark, it’s too hard to blend, and youcan’t go anywhere with it. It’s very heavy, and it makes your eye looksmall. So start with that color all over and blend it.

Take your eyeliner pencil and line the top and the bottom of your liddown by the lash. Add your second eye shadow color that is a darkercolor, but still a little translucent so you can see through it. Put that onthe lid area up to the crease. Blend the top at the crease, where youblink, with a Q-tip, to soften the line, so it’s very natural-looking.

Put on another coat of mascara.

If you want to get a little more exotic for evening, follow with aliquid liner just on top, and that will give you a foolproof eye—it’seasy, and anyone can do it.

# Brows

You also have to pay attention to your brows—they really highlightyour face. It’s important to keep them clean, and not too unkempt. WithAudrey, they became her signature. When she started, her brows werequite heavy, and then as the years went by, they lightened them up a bitso she didn’t get “stuck” in one look. I think it’s worth having themprofessionally done so you know what looks good on you, and canfollow the line at home.

# Lips

Keep your lipstick close to the actual color of your lips. Apply thelipstick as you normally would with a brush. Follow with a slightlyclear lip gloss, and then use lip liner only on the edge of the top of thelips, for a soft, natural look.

# Powder

Use the least amount of powder, and use a light one with the smallestamount of titanium in it. You don’t want to use a heavy powder, as thatwill instantly age you ten years. Use a brush, and tap off the excess.

Posture Now, we’re not saying you have to walk like a plebe at West Point,but there is a reason AH could wear the simplest nothing and make it lookamazing. Chin up, shoulders back, and when you walk into that room, walkin there like you own it—think of AH gliding across that tennis court in thatamazing Givenchy gown in Sabrina (even if you’re wearing chinos).

Lower your voice. We don’t even know if this is possible, but if you can, tryto lower your voice; think: dulcet. Think Audrey on the fire escape inBreakfast at Tiffany’s, singing “Moon River” to herself. No chirpy littleValley-Girl-Paris Hilton-Don’t-Take-Me-Too-Seriously speak.

The ubiquitous ballet flat. Fact: Audrey was the first person to wear balletslippers in public. The lesson here is, take something from your life(Audrey’s first dream was to become a ballet dancer, a wish that wascurtailed by WWII and her height) and bring it out into the public. Then, with

any luck, it will become a fashion perennial three generations later.

Never enderestimate the power Of a good White Shirt. Or trim black trousers,or a turtleneck, or the right haircut that shows off your profile . . . which leadsto the second corollary that style has little to do with money. Audrey worejeans and a polo shirt as authoritatively as a mink shrug or Givenchy ballgown.

# Care and Feeding of the White Shirt

Nothing says Audrey like a good white shirt. From the time she firstset foot in Hollywood until her final days, Audrey knew the inherentstyle power of a crisp white button-down shirt.

Models, actresses, and anchormen know that a white shirt is the bestoption when you are being photographed because the white reflects upand illuminates your face (which is also why saints in medievalpaintings are always painted with a halo around their faces). CocoChanel knew this, and favored white silk shirts with wide, roundedcollars under her famous suit, as does Diane Sawyer. And, by the way,that is also why working actresses and models stay out of the sun.

# Some Specifics

Go for a straight cut. Not too tight, or fitted. Make sure it fits at theshoulders.

Choose a strong, classic man-style collar and no pockets (which ruinthe line, adding bulk and weight). To make it more individual, look forpiqué, fine cotton, tuxedo front, tiny ruffles at the bib, or French cuffs(just not all together).

We think untucked is starting to look old. If you tuck your shirt in,check that it is smooth, without wrinkles and bumps, which is why ithelps to wear a slim skirt or pants of heavier material (flannel, tweed),or jeans.

Audrey’s waist was so diminutive that she could leave her shirtuntied and unbuttoned, wrap the ends around her waist, and tie them atthe back. Hey—give it a shot, why not?

Iron it. We know, boring but necessary. Think of how fabulous it will

look, and besides, do you ever recall seeing a photograph of Audrey ina wrinkled shirt?

Launder it and lightly starch it at home. Dry-cleaning causesyellowing.

The Boyfriend Option. Nothing is more adorable—or says “I have lotsof beaux and/or handsome brothers!”—than wearing an oversizedman’s shirt. A little Annie Hall, a little Katharine Hepburn. When shefirst came out to Hollywood, AH did a mildly racy (for the time), shootfor Life magazine in which she spoke on the telephone wearing only anoversized white shirt. Knowing AH, we are sure it just appeared thatway—but the baroness was not happy.

The white shirt should be a staple for anyone’s wardrobe, and,fortunately for us, there are many options from the most expensive tothe Gap. Here are some we like.

Banana Republic. The fashion insider’s go-to place for 100 percent T-shirts and the white shirt.

Thomas Pink. Your sister found out about this place years ago whenshe was living in London with her Brit boyfriend (now husband), andused to carry them home across the Atlantic for extraspecial gifts.

The Gap. Reliable, reliable, reliable, and yes, still reliable.

Petit Bateau. PB is the true fashion editor’s favorite. Pricey butamazing. They’ll last forever, and whether a newborn or ninety, youwill look great in them, too. Don’t let the French sizing throw you off.

Anne Fontaine. When you are ready to grow up a bit and move beyondGap or Banana Republic simplicity, this French woman makes the moststunning shirts (only white—which we love), that are detailed with lace,jacquard, and embroidery.

Valentino. You can’t go wrong with Mr. Val. Our favorite Italiandesigner always does a few beautiful white shirts each season that areas chic with white jeans as with a taffeta evening skirt. If your ship hascome in—or even if you are expecting it soon—pick up a few.

Chanel. Years ago, we spent the afternoon with Audrey Wilder(director Billy’s wife), reminiscing about Audrey H, Marilyn Monroe,Nancy Reagan, and Hollywood in the old days. She was a delightfulwoman and raconteur. In Wilder’s memory-filled apartment in LosAngeles, she spoke freely, smoked unabashedly, and offered us the

chicest doughnut peaches as a snack. Oh, and she wore trousers and themost beautiful silk Chanel shirt with a long pearl necklace.

Although it is rare to individually tailor a shirt (although, god knows,Wallis Simpson had three fittings for her nightgowns during her earlycourtship with the Duke of Windsor, and look where it got her), makesure it fits when you buy it. Cotton or silk is best, although sometimesyou can get it with a bit of stretch.

Make friends With your tailor. If you’ve read this far, chances are youalready know it, but even if you buy something straight off the rack(especially if you buy something off the rack), get to a tailor and make sureeverything fits perfectly. Edith Head recalled that Audrey’s Paramountfittings “were of the ten hour, not ten minute kind.” As Cameron Silver, whoruns Decade, the shop in L.A. for all of those vintage Oscar gowns, says,“Your tailor is more important than your shrink!”

The well-thought-out accessory. For all of her almost Oriental restraint,Audrey understood the impact of the properly chosen accoutrement: a smalldog, oversized black sunglasses, some borrowed Schlumberger, Cary Grant.

# All That Glitters ...

Audrey bought, wore, owned, and borrowed jewelry from the BigFour—Tiffany’s, Cartier, Harry Winston, and Van Cleef & Arpels. Oh,and Bulgari, who did her engagement ring for her marriage to hersecond husband, Andrea Dotti. During her first success as an actress,she got a diamanté collar for her dog, Famous, from Van Cleef—now,that’s (puppy) love. When shooting Breakfast at Tiffany’s, she woreSchlumberger, and for How to Steal a Million, the jewelry was byCartier.

But mostly (and why are we not surprised?), AH was aboutsimplicity in the bling department. Since she never had her ears pierced,she favored a pair of single-pearl and diamond clips in the 1950s andearly ’60s.

And in spite of the Cartier and VC&A at her disposal, Audrey wasnot above the occasional faux piece that Givenchy designed to go with

her evening gowns when she attended awards ceremonies in the 1970sand ’80s.

Audrey never wore a watch. For some reason, she just did not likethem. And yet, she was always on time. When she was married, shewore a simple wedding band, and in her later years, she wore two ringson her left pinkie—one that Rob had given her as a Christmas gift, withsome tiny diamonds, and another that was made up of some sapphiresSean had gotten in Hong Kong during his first job.

If Audrey were alive today, we just know she would be wildlyaddicted—like the rest of us—to the beyond exquisite designs of Jamesde Givenchy for Taffin, the handsome and talented nephew of you-know-who.

Ignore age. Audrey said that she sometimes felt as if she were twelve yearsold; other times, thirty-eight. It didn’t matter, she thought, few people feeltheir actual age, anyway. “I wouldn’t be able to tell you who I am because ithas never bothered me. I never asked who I am. I don’t care.”

Don’t cancel that Times subscription just yet. Let’s face it: Whatever it was,Audrey had it. Fashion illustrator Joe Eula recalled, “You look into thoseeyes and suddenly you find yourself agreeing with everything she says.” Atthe core of Audrey’s appeal was her intelligence and her personality: acombination of innocence and playful sophistication. “She spoke manylanguages fluently—English, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish, and probablyothers of which I am not aware,” said director Stanley Donen. So go tocollege, read a book (no, Us Weekly does not count), watch Charlie Rose. Beinformed, be curious, be engaged in life—that is the difference between apretty face and a truly beautiful woman.

For Audrey, her choice of clothing was not simply about fashion or style(although it certainly was about that), or even projecting her personality outto the world (although it did that, too). Instead, in her increasingly public life,the right clothing gave Audrey a certain reassurance. “Clothes, as they say,make the man,” she noted. “But they certainly have, with me, given me theconfidence I often needed.”

And Audrey never lost her love for clothes. As Rob recalls, “Even in thelast months of her life, dressing was important to her. It was like a little girldressing up. She was herself, you know, she didn’t become someone else.

But she never lost the fun of dressing up.”

We hope you don’t, either.

“A fourteen-year-old might not really know Audrey’s history as anactress, but she can really love her look, and a fifty-year-old womancan feel the exact same way— which shows you that simplicity andquality wins out.”Michael Kors

# THE PERFECT MAN . . . STYLEWISE

While Audrey had her share of romances, there was one man who contributedthe most to her style: Hubert de Givenchy.

It was the summer of 1953, and Audrey was in preproduction for Sabrinaand had gone to Paris at the behest of director Billy Wilder. She was playinga chauffeur’s daughter who grew up on a Long Island estate. Bookish andignored by the two sons of the house, she goes to cooking school in Paris andarrives at the Glen Cove train station wearing a gray wool suit cut to withinan inch of her life. Accessorized by dark red lipstick, white gloves, and acloche, a gray poodle and a pile of hard-sided luggage, she is the Audrey weknow.

Now the definition of chic, she is picked up by David Larrabee (WilliamHolden), who is instantly smitten.

“Don’t I know you?” he asks, wondering if her father is in transportation.

Something like that—she says, smiling, mysterious.

It is one of the great film entrances of all time—Audrey in a "jazzy”French suit24with just enough mystery to make you wonder. Obviously,some great clothing was needed to make the transformation believable, andno one thought Edith Head, Paramount’s lead costume designer, was up tothe task. “The kind of glamorous suit we needed for Audrey when she comesback, imbued with the taste of Paris—Edith had no idea what it was,” saidBilly Wilder.

Unfortunately, Edith did not really “get” Audrey in terms of fashion. Inone 1953 Paramount Sabrina memo, she “advised Hepburn to stay awayfrom dead black.” Which is hilarious, in a way, because Audrey used this

color to great effect her entire life. “When you think of Audrey Hepburn—Audrey Hepburn is black!” pronounced fashion icon Polly Mellon. “Nobodywore black better than Audrey—she owned it!”

No matter. One of the great friendships—and style collaborations of alltime—was set in motion when Gladys De Segonzac, wife of the Paris head ofParamount, called and asked Hubert if he would meet with “Miss Hepburn.”Givenchy was intrigued. Just four years older that Audrey, he had opened hisown studio the year before on the Rue Alfred de Vigny.

Of course, he assumed she meant Katharine Hepburn, as Roman Holidayhadn’t been released yet, so there was no reason for him to know this “skinnylittle nobody” (as Audrey referred to herself).

He agreed.

Audrey showed up at his atelier, all charm and nervous energy. She wasbeautiful, that he could see. But Hubert was surrounded by the most beautifulwomen in the world every day. She was both open and shy. She lovedfashion and she needed him, or so she said. She was also a little bit goofy.But upon meeting her, he had no idea, really, who she was.

Once the miscommunication was resolved and he understood what she wasafter, he explained that it would be impossible for him to help her—much asshe said she loved his work—as he was in the midst of preparing hiscollection and had no time to assist her.

Please, she begged. Please. There must be something.

Hubert looked at her and relented. (How could he not?) And allowedAudrey to try on some of the samples from the previous season’sspring/summer collection.

And what a collection it was. Audrey ultimately chose three pieces, andfrom those three pieces, an entire style—that we are still influenced by today—was born.

In the end (which was really the beginning), Audrey chose something wecall the “Glen Cove Suit,” the classic French suit she wore at the Glen Covetrain station, breaking a thousand hearts; a white ball gown, number 808 ofthe collection, known as the “Inez de Castro”; and finally, “the Date Dress,”the classic little black dress she wore on her date with Linus Larrabee(Humphrey Bogart). A dress to change your life.

Audrey took those three outfits and walked straight into fashion history.

Edith might not have been a designer, but there was one thing she

understood: studio politics. A fierce in-fighter (no small thing in Hollywood),she had it written into her contract that she would receive top billing for anyParamount film. So when Audrey invited Givenchy to California to attend thescreening of Sabrina, she was stung to see that Givenchy was not evenmentioned in the credits.

Givenchy, for his part, was too polite to comment, saying that it must havebeen an “oversight.”

In spite of Edith’s maneuvering, Givenchy’s lack of public recognitiondidn’t matter, because after Sabrina, suddenly everyone wanted to haveAudrey Style. “Everyone on the street was copying Audrey’s hair,” saidDreda Mele, the director of Givenchy’s atelier, “the way she moved, the wayshe spoke. Everyone wanted to look like Audrey Hepburn. They copied herfor ten solid years after.” Writing in Vogue, Cecil Beaton agreed: “Thousandsof imitations have appeared. The woods are full of emaciated young ladieswith rat-nibbled hair and moon-pale faces.”

And did Audrey notice her effect on fashion?

“Well,” exclaims Audrey Wilder, “when she saw an imitation of herselfwalking down the street—sure she did!”

With the dawning of Sabrina, Audrey and Hubert formed a symbioticrelationship of the most perfect sort. In the wake of her success, Audrey cameto believe that she needed Hubert’s clothing. “I had a very slim kind oftechnique,” she said. Whether this was true or not was almost beside thepoint. The fact is, she believed it.

“What helped me out a great deal with the part are the clothes,” Audreysaid. “It was often an enormous help to know that you looked the part, andthe rest wasn’t so tough anymore.” She later said, most touchingly, thatHubert’s clothes made her feel “protected.”

For his part, Givenchy was not draping yet another mannequin. In regardto Hepburn, he said, “Audrey knows everything that is good for her. Shegives me direction. She is definite.”

Audrey and Hubert: with fashion being the least of it, what a partnership.

In the wake of their initial success, Givenchy and Audrey continued thelongest-running, most successful fashion collaboration of all time—betterthan most marriages, most business arrangements, the relationship betweenmost directors and their stars. After Sabrina, Givenchy continued with an all-star lineup, designing her wardrobe for Funny Face (1957), Love in the

Afternoon (1957), Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961), Charade (1963), Paris WhenIt Sizzles (1964), and How to Steal a Million (1966), as well as the dress forher second wedding, and her sons’ christenings. Their thirty-year friendshipand their fashionable string of hits was unrivaled, especially today when starsand celebrities depend on a designer or, god forbid, a stylist to tell them whatto wear. Audrey knew what she wanted, and she knew who to work with togive it to her.

“I have always considered Audrey my sister,” Hubert said. And on somelevel, he may have been the man Audrey trusted most— certainly before shemet Robert Wolders. In honor of her sixtieth birthday, he had an allee of sixtypink rosebushes planted at La Paisible. She even asked him to be herlégataire testamentaire, an executor of her estate.

He and Audrey understood each other. With their increasingly public lives,they knew how important, how rare, this understanding was. “The two ofthem were very alike—so rigorous, well organized, concentrated on theirwork—and behaving so well at every moment of life,” observed Dreda Mele.For his part, Givenchy said, “Audrey knows everything that is good for her.She gives me direction. She is definite. You must have people around youwho understand the same music.”

And unlike her husbands or some friends, Hubert never betrayed ordisappointed Audrey. In many ways, he was perfect.

# The Original LBD

“When the little black dress is right, there is nothing else to wear inits place.” —The Duchess of Windsor

The little black dress. Invented by Chanel in 1926, it was dubbed“the Ford Dress” by Vogue because, like the Model T, it became aninstant craze, was wildly popular, and came in one color, black.Givenchy brought it to its highest levels of restraint and sophisticationin the 1960s, while one person—Audrey Hepburn—became the living,breathing personification of everything the LBD stood for.

The evening dress Audrey wore in the opening scene at Breakfast atTiffany’s, nibbling a Danish and gazing at the windows that poignant

morning, is probably the most iconographic. But there is also the LBDshe wore on her date with Humphrey Bogart in Sabrina—encouragingwomen everywhere to bare their collarbones and submit to theoccasional set of pushups (which, god knows, Audrey never did). Orthe grown-up and glammed-out version she wore in Paris When ItSizzles.

Prior to her death in January 1993, Audrey gave Givenchy more thantwenty-five dresses he had made for her, which he keeps in his Parisapartment. One by one he is distributing them to museums around theworld. In December 2006, he auctioned the Breakfast at Tiffany’s dressto benefit the City of Joy Aid, a charity that helps India’s poor. At thetime it was announced, no one knew how high the bidding might go,since this was, after all, the most famous dress belonging to the mostfashionable woman in the world.

But auction insiders knew it was going to be a very serious number.Because one was bidding against not only every designer, every Vogueeditor, every Audrey fan in the world, but also every Wall Street guywho wanted to impress his wife, Tiffany & Co., as well as threequarters of the population of Japan, China, and San Francisco. If onlyfor bragging rights, there were a lot of Audrey fans in the world whowould love to get their hands on the dress—and help charity at the sametime.

In 1986, Christy Turlington wore a dress from Breakfast at Tiffany’son a shoot for Vanity Fair. She was not modeling the dress that wasauctioned but the one Holly Golightly wore to visit her beau, SallyTomato (a mobster), at Sing Sing. As Christy recalls, “We reenactedsome of the scenes, with kind of a modern twist—we did a picture witha cigarette holder and coffee in front of Tower Records. A little scenewith a cat, that kind of thing.”

But beyond fashion, why does Christy think Audrey is such aninfluence, even today?

“There’s something quite childlike and vulnerable about her. I thinkthat kind of playfulness. She just seemed to carry herself with suchdignity and grace, and you would never know about the hardships thatshe endured.

“I guess that’s what I respect most, because in our day and age, when

everyone knows everything about everyone! I mean, I don’t know if shewas involved in any scandals, maybe she was. I think she kept a sort ofgrace that people respected. And I always find that nice, that reserve,that’s very intriguing.”

The beauty of the black dress, which most women realize, is that it isalmost economical. If cost is a concern, copies abound in all differentprice points—that is the beauty of the perfect black dress. As CandyPratts Price observes, “It can be the same black dress for thirty years—if it’s the right black dress. You can dress it up and wear it to theOscars, or your sixteen-year-old niece can wear it with flip-flops and alittle sweater. Bare your arms, bare your legs, too, if you are feelingseduisantes. Most definitely wear heels.”

And finally, for some style advice—who has taken Givenchy’smantle in the LBD department?

While John Galliano (any year, any style) is master of the MostLikely To Be Donated To The Met Costume Institute When You AreDone With It Award, as well as the inevitable “Wow— that dress costsas much as a car!” comment, in considering a dress you can actuallypurchase, hang in your closet, and wear to dinner, our vote goes toValentino.

And, by the way, the original original LBD that Audrey wore inBreakfast at Tiffany’s sold for $920,000—more than six times thepresale estimate—at auction on December 7, 2006. According to theChristie’s Web site, it was bought via telephone by a private Europeanbuyer, and set a world record price for a dress made for a movie.

“There are tears in my eyes,” said Dominic Lapierre, who sold thedress on behalf of the charity. “I am absolutely dumbfounded to believethat a piece of cloth which belonged to such a magical actress will nowenable me to buy bricks and cement to put the most destitute children inthe world into schools.”

“I can’t understand how a woman can leave the house without fixingherself up a little, if only out of politeness. You never know, maybethat’s the day she has a date with destiny, and it’s best to be as prettyas possible for destiny.” —Coco Chanel

# THE AH DIET/EXERCISE REGIME

How did AH maintain her enviable (beyond enviable) figure her entire life?And, for the record, we have seen her fitting form at Western Costume inL.A., showing her measurements in her late fifties, having had two children .. . and gamine does not begin to describe her shape.

Although miraculous might.

Like most fashionable women of the time (Babe, Jackie, Gloria Guinness,Diana Vreeland, Pauline de Rothschild, Slim Keith), Audrey engaged in thecigarette/salad as entrée/minimal exercise diet. And what can we learn fromher today?

1. The first thing to be aware of is that Audrey had a heck of a metabolism.Part of this, of course, is pure genetics (something you cannot do a thingabout). And part of it, unfortunately, is the deprivation she suffered duringWWII, when there were extreme food shortages, from the ages of eleventhrough sixteen (the time of greatest growth for girls). By the time the Alliedarmy liberated Arnhem, AH was down to ninety pounds and suffering from avariety of diseases—asthma, jaundice, anemia, and severe edema, a swellingof the joints and limbs, where the blood literally turns to water.

Her experience during the war explains why AH had such trouble gainingweight, had beer with her meals during film shoots to keep her weight up,and, in fact, could eat bowls of pasta her entire adult life (with great relish,we might add).

2. Trained as a ballet dancer, AH had a great deal of discipline. (“I don’tcare what anyone says—you can tell a ballerina when she’s coming down thestreet whether she’s eighty or twenty!” observes Candy Pratts Price.)

Audrey had an unerring visual eye and just knew what worked for her, andwhat didn’t. Living in London after the war, she was discovered by the writerColette and won the role of Gigi on Broadway. Coming over from Englandon the Queen Mary for rehearsals, she ate everything in sight and quicklygained twenty pounds. Upon seeing her, the producers were dismayed to findthat their leading ingénue was a bit less sprightly. Adopting an Atkins-esquediet of steak tartare and green salad at Dinty Moore’s, the famous Broadwayhang-out, Audrey soon returned to her preferred 110 pounds. And stayedthere her entire life.

3. AH rarely exercised. Although she took dance classes when she could

spare the time in her twenties (and certainly during the filming of FunnyFace), there is no known evidence of her ever setting foot in a gym, gettingon a treadmill, working out with a trainer, sweating to the oldies with RichardSimmons, etc.

Although she was naturally graceful, and moved beautifully, Audrey wasnot trained in any particular sport (unlike Jacqueline Kennedy or KatharineHepburn, who were exercise fanatics). When she and Mel lived inSwitzerland, she didn’t even ski, as the studio insurance policy wouldn’tallow it.

But what Audrey did do—which is something we can all do, no matterwhat our age, where we live, or even our current physical condition—is walk.Audrey was a fresh-air fanatic and walked miles and miles—fast—afterdinner when she was in Switzerland. So pull out those sneakers and hit theroad.

4. Audrey smoked two, and sometimes three, packs of cigarettes a day herentire adult life, from the age of about fifteen on (as did Jacqueline Kennedyand Babe Paley, for that matter). In the old days (i.e., pre 1970 SurgeonGeneral’s warning), people were far less vigilant about the dangers oftobacco.

And even today, if you go to L.A. right now, you will see dozens of people(most of whom probably just came from the gym or yoga class) hanging outin the sunshine, enjoying a latte, puffing on a cigarette.

Audrey’s profession did not exactly help matters, either. Every model weknow smokes. Most actors, too—the Olsen twins, Kate Moss, Kate Hudson,Sean Penn, Charlize Theron, Cameron Diaz, Keira Knightley, Johnny Depp,Colin Farrell, Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Brad Pitt, Demi Moore,Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alec Baldwin.25

The problem, of course, is that cigarettes will kill you or, at the very least,make you very sick. You might be able to get away with it— like so muchelse—when you are young, but in the long run, you are better off quitting or,better yet, not starting. If you need a role model, Christy Turlington (rareamong models for her college degree and equable poise) gave it up years ago,and even appeared in a public service announcement encouraging youngpeople to do the same.

5. Some people (okay, mostly women) tend to do one of two things when

they get stressed—eat more, or eat less. Personally, we have friends in eachcamp. When Audrey got stressed, she did not head for the freezer and pullout a half gallon of Breyers; she got focused, probably worried too much, andate less than she normally might. While shooting The Unforgiven with JohnHuston in Mexico in 1958, Audrey learned to her great delight that she waspregnant. Unfortunately, she was thrown from a horse during filming andsuffered four fractured vertebrae and a badly sprained foot. Terrified that shemight lose the baby, she finished the film in April and, together with Mel,went home to Switzerland to await the birth of their child.

An even greater sorrow awaited her when she went into labor, for the babywas stillborn. The loss pitched Audrey into such a deep depression that Melfeared for her sanity. She smoked over three packs of cigarettes a day, bit hernails to the quick, and lost almost fifteen pounds. At thirty, her grief andheartache caused her to look years older.

It was not until the birth of her son Sean in 1960 that she regained herequilibrium.

# Quitters Are Winners ...

Nicotine is supposed to be as hard to kick as heroin. There is theprescription patch, and Drew Barrymore and Matt Damon quit smokingby hypnosis. This is not meant to be medical advice, of course, but hereare a few more tips from The Juicing Bible, by Pat Crocker and SusanEagles.

• Maintain constant blood sugar by eating six meals a day, consistingof fresh fruits and vegetables, and a little protein and whole grains.

• Ease withdrawal symptoms with a mainly vegetarian diet.

• Exercise regularly. Walking and breathing exercises are excellent.

• Snack on sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. The zinc contentmay reduce cravings by blocking taste enzymes.

• Eat plenty of oats. Studies show that oats diminish nicotinecravings.

• Soothe the nerves by drinking calming herbal teas, such aschamomile, mint, or ginger. (Christy Turlington found that she had to

give up caffeine while quitting smoking, because she associated coffeewith cigs.)

# Buff Basics

This was Audrey’s general regime, but for the rest of us mere mortals who donot have her blessed metabolism, how can we get (and stay) in fightingshape?

David Kirsch, author of The Ultimate New York Diet, who operates theMadison Square Club and trains luminaries such as Ellen Barkin, KarolinaKurkova, and actress Kerry Washington, does not believe in dieting.“America is the processed carb capital of the world. You want to eat realfood, you need to have a balanced diet, and diets per se don’t work. Themoment we think diet, we think deprivation, and we don’t want to live thatway—life is too difficult.”

Instead, he advises that we stay away (as much as possible) from processedfood and if you would like to jump-start your progress, avoid alcohol, bread,overly processed carbohydrates like white bread, white sugar, high-fructosecorn syrup, and high-fat dairy for two weeks.

In terms of exercise, Kirsch believes that movement—of almost any kind—is key. “Everyone can move their body. It’s not sets and repetitions and100 pounds, it’s moving. You also need to know your body. If walking iseasy for you, then maybe you should be swimming, or maybe you should beriding the bicycle, or use the rowing machine. But don’t run if you’re reallyoverweight, or have bad knees. One needs to pick the exercise that you likethe most.”

On the West Coast, Gregory Joujon-Roche, founder of the WestHollywood lifestyle center Holistic Fitness, will spend weeks to monthsgetting stars like Tobey Maguire and Brad Pitt ready for movies such asSpider-Man 3 and Troy. Joujon-Roche, who is generally paid by studioproduction companies for his work, gets script access so he can help hisclients with everything from stunt choreography to learning how to gracefullyswing a sword.

But when it comes to giving clients exercises that work the whole body,Joujon-Roche says basic moves can have a big impact. If you really want to

change your body, Joujon-Roche says men should do fifty push-ups a day,rain or shine. Women should shoot for thirty.

And if you need further motivation, Michelle Pfeiffer avoids wheat, dairy,and sugar (although she admits to having the occasional Krispy Kreme), andruns four to six miles a day. And uses sunblock religiously. And look at howwell it works for her.

# AH VS. JKO

# “Audrey had far more personal style than Jackie. . . . Jackie took hercues from Audrey.”—Vera Wang

In a debate that still roils fashion-conscious consignetti, one wonders: Whatcame first, the Audrey or the Jackie? Or, put another way—did Audreyinfluence Jackie’s look or vice versa?

Audrey and Jackie were, along with Grace Kelly, born in 1929. Audreyand Jackie were known for their beauty, personal style, constant search forprivacy, and courage. They were also both modern, single (albeit famous)working mothers for much of their lives. However, we believe that in strictlyhistorical terms, Miss Hepburn would be the clear winner in any Jackieversus Audrey throwdown.

Let’s look at the time line. In 1951, Jackie won Vogue’s Prix de Pariswriting contest, beating out thousands of college seniors across the country.During the same year, Audrey appeared in tiny parts in films in England andin the stage play Gigi on Broadway.

Living at home with her mother and stepfather, Hugh D. Auchincloss, inMcLean, Virginia, in 1952, Jackie worked as an “Inquiring Camera Girl” forthe Washington Times-Herald, asking whimsical questions of men likeSenator John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon for $\$ 56.75$ aweek.

Audrey appeared in American Vogue no less than four times in 1954.

She also shot Roman Holiday with Gregory Peck that year, her first “real”role in a Hollywood motion picture, and won a Tony for Ondine, as well as aGolden Globe and an Oscar (her first time out of the gate) for Roman Holidayin 1954.

Although Jackie followed fashion with the avidity of a baseball fan

watching the World Series, Audrey had been close friends with Givenchysince 1952. Jackie, on the other hand, would not be able to afford anythingbut copies of French couture until she married her husband and he waselected to the White House in 1961. There, averting a possible PR scandal,his father, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, took care of the bills. Forpolitical expediency, Jackie’s love (and growing collection) of Givenchyoriginals were kept out of the press, and Hollywoodcostumer/playboy/Kennedy pal Oleg Cassini was conjured up as her officialdesigner.

“It is not reality, but the appearance of things that count!” the ambassadoroften lectured his sons and daughters, and in reality, Jackie wore a lot ofGivenchy and Chanel smuggled into the country by a variety of ruses,including her sister Lee Radziwill, diplomatic couriers, and stores that cateredto the upper class, such as Chez Ninon and Bergdorf Goodman in New YorkCity. At the time, it was even said by Women’s Wear Daily (then an obscureindustry rag) that Givenchy offered behind-the-scene advice for what Jackieshould wear to various high-profile events.

Were circumstances different, Audrey herself might have become the FirstLady of Camelot. But although the senator was one of the most eligiblebachelors in the country, they both knew that as an actress, a European, and anon-Catholic, Audrey did not stand a chance of becoming Mrs. Kennedy. Nodoubt, this added a certain bittersweet undertone to their friendship. Kennedywas said to be fascinated with Audrey, telling Time magazine that RomanHoliday was his favorite picture of the year. “She out-Jackied Jackie,” saidone friend of Audrey’s who knew them both.

Instead, Mr. and Mrs. Auchincloss announced their daughter’s engagementto the senator, and Audrey went off to the North Shore of Long Island—interestingly, both Jack’s and Jackie’s teenage stomping grounds—to filmSabrina.

In later years, as Jackie’s star ascended, the president called Audrey fromtime to time to tell her how much he enjoyed her latest movie. She even sang“Happy Birthday” to him in 1963, the year after Marilyn’s memorableperformance, at the last birthday of his life.

Style, talent, heartbreak, and extreme discretion linked Audrey and Jackie,as well as the irony of two innately private, somewhat shy women having tolead such public lives.

Although Audrey was, if possible, even trimmer than Jackie, and Jackie farmore athletic than Audrey, their personal styles were not dissimilar. Theyboth favored jeans and sportswear for the day and were capable of seriouslyglamming it up at night. They shared an intense dislike of publicity forpublicity’s sake, and adored—and were fiercely protective of—their children.They both smoked, loved chocolate ice cream, wore oversized darksunglasses, and, because of discipline, a searching intelligence, or merelyfortunate genes, aged very, very well.

In the late 1980s, Miss Hepburn and Mrs. Onassis met by chance at theCarlyle Hotel in New York City. The erstwhile princess and the former FirstLady, seated at a velvet banquette—what did they discuss, we wonder?

How we would love to have been there.

“Beauty comes from the inside. . . .”—AH

# The Audrey Essentials

So you’ve read this far and you’re thinking to yourself, it’simpossible to be like Audrey—you’re an American, your mother is nota Dutch baroness, God did not grace you with such admirablecheekbones (or clavicle), you have so little time, plus, you love bakedgoods.

We get it. We’re with you. But don’t let any of this discourage you.Herewith, the pared-down checklist for developing your own AudreyStyle.

1. Wear mascara.

2. Stand up straight.

3. Get your clothes tailored.

4. Lower your voice.

5. When in doubt, love.

6. Be generous.

7. Don’t kiss and tell.

8. Forgive.

9. Turn around and check the back of your reflection in the mirrorbefore you leave the house.

# 10. Smile.

And finally, having written all this, we want to leave you with one thought:The way you look on the outside has little to do with true beauty. Don’t focuson the externals to the exclusion of who you are on the inside. As Audreysaid herself, “Whenever I hear or read I’m beautiful, I simply don’tunderstand it. I didn’t make my career on beauty.” Some of the mostcompelling men and women of our time (Mother Teresa, Georgia O’Keeffe,Abraham Lincoln, Picasso) never set foot in a beauty parlor, or a gym, theirentire lives. And yet they were extraordinary-looking. So again, in the sameway that size, or money, has little to do with style, your purely physicalexterior has little to do with beauty.

If Audrey were reading this, she would probably be a bit embarrassed at allof this emphasis on her beauty. So after you have put on your mascara, orgotten your haircut—teach a child to read, call up a friend who is goingthrough some hard times and offer a word of encouragement. Get online andgive what you can to UNICEF. We can’t tell you how strongly we feel aboutthis—and know that Audrey would, too.

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Buy knockoffs? No. She had too much respect for the work designers did.With the first money she made as an actress in Gigi, she bought a Givenchycoat. A faithful customer for the rest of her life, she bought a few things eachseason.

But Audrey was not a label snob. While she wore Givenchy or Valentinowith aplomb, she also wore jeans during her off hours. Or a polo shirt andKeds sneakers.

Like any good jet-setter, she picked things up in Europe and at little shopsin Italy (mixing a Givenchy mink “sweatshirt” and trim black trousers with abrightly colored straw Mexican tote in her own distinctive style), whentraveling abroad was a luxury few Americans experienced.

Mix high and low? Yes. Jeffrey Banks tells the story of Audrey and Robbeing in NYC for UNICEF work. Audrey had left her lipstick at the hotel, sothey ducked into a drugstore and bought a $\$ 3.99$ lipstick. Needless to say, thegirl behind the counter was stunned.

Hit the mall? Yes, Audrey loved malls. When visiting Rob’s family inRochester in the 1970s, Audrey used to entertain herself by visiting theIrondequoit Mall and buying gifts for friend’s children at the Gap (which wasnot in Europe at the time).

Look at labels? Yes, and then ignore them.

Use clothing to both reveal and conceal herself ? Absolutely. Audrey usedfashion to show that she was both whimsical and proper and had a heck of awaistline.

Share her beauty secrets? Sure, why not? She believed in massage—threetimes a week. She also knew she felt, and looked, better when she got enoughsleep, and she liked taking hot baths to relax. She ate a variety of foods, notthe same old thing (“and not pasta three times a day”), and took vitamin C ora multivitamin in the winter if she needed it. “I eat healthy food, not healthfood . . . fresh fruits and vegetables and meats.”

But other than that, she “didn’t believe in any rigid rules. You have to beas relaxed as possible about food and fitness and the rest of it, or you’ll be aslave to your beauty habits. . . .”

Be fastidious about taking her makeup Off? Yes. Having worked in thetheater, she saw “what not removing makeup really well can do to the skin.”She was “a Laszlo girl,” but had no “exceptional things that I do or don’t puton my face at night. . . . I do believe that good health is the key to good skin.If your skin isn’t good, it’s a signal that something is wrong.”

Lose the earrings? Yes. According to Connie Wald (herself named to VanityFair’s International Best Dressed List), Audrey’s “taste was heavenly, shelooked as good in T-shirt and jeans. But her style was just born in her,everything about her was en pointe—it was Just Right. She always used tojoke when we tried on earrings, ‘Take it off! Less is better—take it off!’ ”

Although that is sartorial advice, the same applies to close friends,diamonds, and dessert: Less is more.

Have a regular manicure and pedicure? Yes. Audrey had beautiful hands, andfavored clear, natural-looking nail polish—never color. When money wastight, she would have done it herself or her mother could have given her one.While struggling to make ends meet in London after WWII, the baronessworked as a manicurist.

Try on a dress properly? Yes. According to Rob, “Audrey was so smart,whenever she would try on a dress, she knew that you couldn’t just do it

without the hair being coiffed, the right shoes, the stockings, and maybe someearrings to go with it.” When she tried on a dress for a big event, he recalled,“She would go into her room for half an hour, and she came back, and I wasabsolutely dazzled! The cloth suddenly had contour, and shape, and life, andshe was so gorgeous.”

Leave the house without wearing mascara? Never. Audrey was known for herbeautiful eyes, and when she left the house—no matter where she went—shewas recognized. Always. We like the pink and green classic MaybellineGreat Lash, or Prescriptives.

Be herself ? Absolutely. Cynthia Rowley agrees. “There are some thingsyou’ll do for fashion, and then at some point, you’ll just say— this is notpractical! I can’t walk in these shoes, or I can’t breathe in this dress! Or Idon’t have this body. Each person has to identify with their fashion rolemodel. For me, it’s Audrey. It’s just herself. She wasn’t going to havesurgery—this is how I am, and it was her personality that made her sexy andattractive.

"She’s the coolest.”

# Heartbreak and Solace

"You can’t be Wise and in love at the same time.”

—Bob Dylan

TO the casual observer, Audrey’s life looked like a fairy tale—winning bothan Oscar and a Tony Award her first time out; above-the-title billing withGregory Peck; lifelong friendships with Hubert de Givenchy, Cary Grant,Audrey and Billy Wilder, Ralph Lauren, Harry Belafonte; staying a perfectsize 2 without giving up carbs.

Everything she did looked so effortless.

Once, asked to describe her life, she said, “lucky.” But seen through thehard lens of history, the cards did not always fall in Audrey’s favor. Therewere her experiences during WWII and surviving the Nazis (she did not liketo talk about it, saying, once, “It was worse than anything you can imagine.”);her fraught relationship with her mother; miscarriages and difficulty bearingchildren; the unfaithfulness of her husbands, being dumped by Ben Gazzarain the 1970s (excuse us: Ben Gazzara?); the directorial mishmosh that wasParis When It Sizzles.

Audrey’s life has been fun. It has been exciting and glamorous, celebratedand romantic. But now, we are going to see how Audrey coped when the tideturned against her.

# AH LIFE LESSON NO. 1:

# Things Will Not Always Go Your Way

Audrey’s first real professional dream in life was to be a ballerina. Living inHolland during WWII, her opportunities to study were limited and thennonexistent as life grew harsher and harsher, and they struggled to merelysurvive.

After the war, she and her mother made their way to London, with a

scholarship for Audrey to study with the legendary teacher Marie Rambert. Inspite of her hard work with Rambert, Audrey was a good five years behindthe other young women who had been able to continue their training. In a rareshow of resentment, she said, “My technique didn’t compare with that of thegirls who had had five years of Sadler’s Wells teaching, paid for by theirfamilies, and who had always had good food and bomb shelters. . . .”

Her height was also an issue. Finally, Rambert brought the issue to a closewhen she said that Audrey would be a good ballerina— perhaps good enoughto joins the corps, or possibly to teach, but she would never be a greatballerina.

As Audrey’s son Sean recalled, “My mother told me that she walked homethat afternoon, and her dream had died.”

# AH LIFE LESSON NO. 2:

# Still, Give It Your All

Part of the reason Audrey had so few regrets in her life was because shealways did everything to the best of her ability—which was considerable.

Let’s look at her experience during Green Mansions, a romantic eco-fairytale (if such a thing can be imagined) starring Audrey as Rima, a forest sprite,and Anthony Perkins as a compelling romantic lead, directed by her husband,Mel.

As a director, Mel put forth tremendous effort, but he was no Billy Wilder.(Or William Wyler, Stanley Donen, or Steven Spielberg.) In spite of his bestattempts, the shoot was a mess. Audrey was exceedingly loyal, never pullingrank as the more successful of the two—how awful that would be for ahusband’s ego. Instead, she acted like the pro that she was.

As Bob Willoughby, who was on set, observed, “[Green Mansions] wasMel’s first big directing job, and he didn’t have a clue about a lot of it. Hewould make suggestions and some people on the set would just roll theireyes. Audrey, by that point, had been directed by some of the great directorsof the twentieth century . . . but she didn’t say a word. She didn’t make onecomment. She did what she was told and, like any great actor, gave him what

he wanted. But I thought that showed a good deal about her character—Imean, Liz Taylor would have screamed at him and told him to go to hell.

“She would do the scene exactly the way he had directed it. So there is thatloyalty, and that giving, in Audrey and I quite admired her for that.”

The crew members, on the other hand, did not feel the same marital loyaltytoward Ferrer, and were so unhappy with his direction that they eventhreatened to walk off the set.

Green Mansions was Audrey’s Waterworld.

For once—perhaps for the only time—it seemed as if Audrey had put herinstincts aside and simply decided to make a film with her husband.Honestly, it seems as if Mansions was sort of a Mel gig, and Audrey wentalong for the ride. It was the only one of her films that lost money. Sort of ahighbrow eco-romance, could anyone honestly believe Anthony Perkins(much as we love him) as a compelling masculine lead? Plus, where was thecouture! The Givenchy! Bill Holden! Witty repartee—some sidewalks and astreet!

Maybe we’re being unfair here. After all, it sounded good on paper—Audrey as Rima the Bird Girl?

But then again, maybe not.

But let’s not be too harsh on Green Mansions. After all, consider this: Audreymade twenty-six movies in her career, among them the über classics RomanHoliday, Sabrina, Funny Face, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Charade, Paris WhenIt Sizzles, My Fair Lady, How to Steal a Million,and (our personal favorite)Two for the Road. If she had done nothing but Breakfast at Tiffany’s, thatalone would have ensured her entry to the pantheon of cinematic greatness.So surely she is allowed one mild clunker.

And if nothing else, you have to admit that Ip the deer, which followed heraround in the movie and lived with her at home, was pretty cute.

Besides, on one level (okay, not the box office level), Green Mansionsisreally about the creative attempt—showing up every day, hitting your marks,and giving it your best shot. On Audrey’s part, on Mel’s. Even BobWilloughby’s. And in spite of everything, Audrey gives a credibleperformance and looks lovely in her forest sprite wear. Green Mansions hadto have had the lowest costume budget of any of her films (having spent theentire time barefoot in one very non-Givenchy dress).

But at least the players were not without humor on the Green Mansions

experience. Years later, in 1991, at the Lincoln Center Film Societycelebration for Audrey, the director Wendy Keys was unable to get (and didnot want) a clip of Green Mansions included in the proceedings.

“Do you mind,” she asked Perkins, who had turned down Some Like It Hotto work with Hepburn.

“No, I’m thrilled,” he said.

With the brutal calculation of Hollywood, Mel never directed again. But forhis part, he is gracious about the entire endeavor. As a creative player whocontinued to act and produce successfully, he knew that you roll the dice, andsometimes these things work, and sometimes they don’t.

To biographer Barry Paris, he observed, “Directing Audrey was a delight.It was more a matter of trying to present Audrey at her grave and touchingbest than directing her. She knew what she felt. Revealing it was my job.Perhaps I did not do it well. But Rima remains alive for me, and the film wasa creative effort we were all glad we tried.”

And for Audrey, her experience on Green Mansions was an importantlesson in the price of loyalty, and following (or not following) her instincts.

# AH LIFE LESSON NO. 3:

# Keep Going, Keep Going

In the ensuing years, there was a second and third act to Audrey’s life.Shortly after her divorce from Mel, she married Dr. Andrea Dotti, an Italianpsychiatrist, on January 18, 1969. Wearing a pink jersey ensemble byGivenchy, with an engagement ring from Bulgari, Audrey said, “I felt twelveyears old or maybe twenty, I don’t know. I remember only feeling happy,deliciously happy, and Andrea holding my hand.”

Their son, Luca, was born on February 8, 1970. And again, she wasoverjoyed to be a mother.

After ten years of marriage, this union, too, fell apart due largely to Dotti’srampant infidelity. “Italian men are not known for being faithful,” he onceshrugged, overlooking the fact that he was married to one of the mostmemorable women in the world. Audrey was further embarrassed that while

she was in Switzerland, resting and awaiting the birth of their son, Dotti wasphotographed leaving nightclubs with a succession of beautiful women. Forall of her onscreen serenity, AH was furious that he had chosen to humiliateher.

As she later reflected, “I hung on to both marriages for as long as I could,for the children’s sake. You always hope that if you love somebody enough,everything will be all right—but it isn’t always true.”

# AH LIFE LESSON NO. 4:

# If You’re Not Happy, Split

Audrey had great respect for the institution of marriage. But after a certainpoint, even Audrey had her limits and decided to leave. With each of herhusbands, she put up with a hell of a lot, and then, it was as if somethinginside of her just stopped—for example, when she learned that Dotti had beenconducting romantic trysts in their home. “This is not what I signed up for,”she said.

“I think she knew from the beginning who [Dotti] was,” said Sean, “yet Ithink she dreamed and hoped that somehow she could change that. And Ithink she was gravely disappointed when she realized she couldn’t.” By thespring of 1978, her life with Andrea was effectively over, although thedivorce decree would not be final until 1981. As Audrey later admitted withhindsight, “Dotti was not much of an improvement on Ferrer.”

# AH LIFE LESSON NO. 5:

# And at Least Once, You Will Ask Yourself, "What Was IThinking?”

Okay, we all make mistakes, and get involved with The Wrong Person, evenAudrey Hepburn. Around the time that her second marriage was irrevocably

on the rocks, but slightly before she met (sigh) Rob Wolders, Audrey had abrief, inexplicable run-in with fellow actor Ben Gazzara.

It was simple enough, really. They had met on the set of Blood-line, amurder mystery that probably sounded better on paper than in real life. Basedon the Sidney Sheldon best-seller, it was directed by Terence Young andstarred an international cast of (among others) AH, James Mason, RomySchneider, Omar Sharif, and even Michelle Phillips, who proved—with thisgig—that even the famous have school fees, phone bills, and mortgages topay.

To our eyes, Gazzara could be seen as another—perhaps lesser— versionof Mel. A seemingly charmless tough guy who left most of Audrey’s friendswondering, “What does she see in that guy?” Unhappy, depressed, and adriftwhen it became clear that her second marriage was not going to work, either,in spite of all of her efforts, Audrey was at loose ends.

They began something of an on-set romance. Perhaps it meant a bit moreto Audrey than it should have. Clearly, it meant nothing to Gazzara. Hestopped returning her phone calls; once, he even hung up on her. In the end,he made it clear that he was not interested. In a small way (bastard!), hebroke our girl’s heart. If only for a little while.

And we still harbor a secret grudge against BG (real name: BiagioAnthony Gazzara) for treating Audrey so shabbily.

# AH LIFE LESSON NO. 6:

# There Is Light at the End of the Tunnel

It was during her separation that she met and formed an enduring friendship—finally!—with Robert Wolders, an actor and businessman who was thewidower of Merle Oberon. Both close friends of Connie Wald’s, they met ata dinner at her home in Los Angeles.

It was a sad time in each of their lives. Merle Oberon had died just a fewmonths earlier, and Audrey’s marriage was effectively over, so in thebeginning, there was no thought of romance. As Audrey told interviewerGlenn Plaskin, “I was charmed with him that night, but he didn’t register that

much. He was getting over the death of Merle, [and] it was the worst periodof my life, one of the low ebbs. We both cried into our beers.”

In the beginning, it was quiet between the two of them. Given her maritalhistory, Audrey was extremely hesitant to get involved with anyone, let alonea man seven years her junior. But several months later, Rob happened to bein New York on business when Audrey was shooting They All Laughed withPeter Bogdanovich.26On his last night in town, he was supposed to go toanother dinner party, but met her for drinks at The Pierre. Their conversationwas so engrossing that drinks went on for over an hour, and Audrey ordered agiant plate of pasta. And when their time together was closing in on twohours, Rob knew he would be rudely late for his dinner, so he had to leave,and then get on an airplane back to L.A. early the next morning. But afterthat, they spoke on the telephone practically every day.

Interestingly, Rob had spent the terrible war years near the tiny village ofZwolle, just ten miles from Arnhem, where Audrey had lived. Although theynever met during the war (and Rob was, after all, just a toddler), he andAudrey later shared this experience.

As he said, “Most people associate the war with darkness and deprivation.But they tend to forget that, nevertheless, life goes on. Under thosecircumstances, which Audrey and I discussed, one discovers things that arequite exciting about oneself, in terms of loyalty to other people, the ability tohave fun with very little, your appreciation of life is honed, so any little thingis an encouragement, that life is really all right.”

Their friendship deepened, and Audrey—who had been hurt so terribly byher other two husbands—realized that she could trust Rob. They formed adevoted partnership and remained together for the rest of her life.

# Some Audrey Real-Life Tips for Trying Times

Talk to your friends or someone you trust. When things got tough, AHherself admitted, “I always had a chum I could talk to,” like BFFsConnie Wald and Doris Brynner.

Meditate. Or just sit quietly, close your eyes, and breathe for tenminutes.

Have faith. We are not even sure if we are speaking, specifically, ofreligious faith here. But just—the sense that there is goodness in theworld (along with some great cruelty, too, we know).

Get a pet. “If you want a friend in this town, get a dog,” said PresidentTruman. While Audrey was not a big cat person (except for Breakfastat Tiffany’s), she loved her dogs.

Remain close to your family (unless, of course, they are the source ofyour annoyances). “Mother and I are not alike, but we get on awfullywell,” Audrey once admitted in a somewhat veiled comment. “She’s alovely woman.”

Take a bath. Audrey was a big believer in the power of the warm bathas a way to relax and recharge.

Cry. Okay, we understand this is a totally chick response, but studieshave shown that women are emotionally in better shape than menbecause they can express their emotions. Sometimes you just have toget things off your chest. Besides, think of how beautifully heartbrokenAudrey (as Princess Ann) looked when she had to say good-bye toGregory Peck in one of the closing scenes of Roman Holiday. Well,wouldn’t you cry, too?

Get a massage. As a former dancer, Audrey was a big believer inmassage. “It’s the best thing in the world for you, but you have tochoose the right masseur. Bad massage can break down muscle and ruinyou for life, but a good one gives you a lot of muscle tone and it canmake your circulation go incredibly fast.”

# AH LIFE LESSON NO. 7:

# The Past Is Past

As Rob and Audrey formed their life together at La Paisible, he noticed thatAudrey never indulged herself in living in the past. “I loathe nostalgia!” saidDiana Vreeland, and Audrey could have said the same for herself. She knewwhen to leave the party. Audrey made just twenty-seven films, and althoughsome thought she might have ended her career prematurely, she had no

interest in living in the past. In 1988, at a Dutch retrospective honoring herand showing Funny Face, she told the organizer, “I hope you found a goodprint and the colors are still bright.” When was the last time she saw it? Atthe premiere in 1957.

According to Rob, “Audrey was not nostalgic. Cary Grant and GregoryPeck became like family, but not necessarily family that you saw on a regularbasis. She would see them, in recent years she saw them at functions,industry oriented events, she saw them more and it was like seeing favoritefamily members. It was very healthy, not concerned very much with thepast.”

# AUDREY’S EMOTIONAL MO

Here’s what we can learn from Audrey when we are hit with our ownchallenges.

She kept going. She rose above the situation. She didn’t bad-mouth people.She didn’t sit around and bitch about how Mel or Dotti or some director hadmistreated her. Boring.

Audrey was also capable of great forgiveness. The official story is that shenever saw her father again after he left her mother. Although he was rumoredto be dead, Mel tracked him down through the Red Cross, and the two ofthem traveled to Dublin and met him in 1964. AH, in fact, remained close toher father (now married for the third time), helped support him, and sent himmonthly checks for the remainder of his life (he died in 1980).

# What Do Women Want?

Gentlemen, the bar has been raised—in case you (ever) find yourselfwondering, “What do women want?” Here is Audrey on Rob. . . .

“He’s solid in very way. I can trust him. I trust his love. I never fearI’m losing it. He reassures me. He’s very loving, an affectionate man,and we like the same things—being in the country, the dogs, makingtrips together—and we’re both avid readers, and go shopping together.Everything we do together is fun.”

Plus—and we know you don’t want to hear this, guys—Rob is alsotall, handsome, conscientious (in a nice way), and great fun to share abottle of wine with over lunch.

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Show gratitude (in Spite Of everything)? Absolutely. Perhaps it was the factthat she survived WWII, but Audrey was profoundly grateful for every thingthat had happened in her life. In an interview with Hedda Hopper in 1953,Hedda commented that a recent Time magazine cover did not do her justice(and in reality, it did not), and asked her what she thought.

“I couldn’t care less,” Audrey replied. “I was so thrilled—it was Time.”

See a Shrink? No. It just wasn’t in her background. Audrey would have haddifficulty confiding her innermost thoughts to a stranger. She would havebeen more likely to have a girly tête-à-tête with Connie or Doris.

Engage in retail therapy? Sure. Of course, being Audrey, she could fly offto Paris or Rome and see the latest fashions.

Learn anything from her experience With men? Yes. In later years, she wasasked what she had learned about men, and she replied, “Nothing—what canyou learn about them? They’re human beings, with all the frailties thatwomen have. I think they’re more vulnerable than women. I really do. Youcan hurt a man so easily.”

Get bummed out? Of course she did. She’s human. It is said that at thedemise of her marriages, she was depressed, anxious, unhappy, and smokingthree packs a day, which couldn’t have helped matters.

Give Up on love? No. Even though she was alone for a time, and inchallenging (ahem) marriages, and even (briefly) treated shabbily byschmucks like Ben Gazzara, “I’m a romantic woman,” said Audrey. “What isthere without it? Life becomes just so gray.” Still, she might have wonderedabout it a bit—when it was going to show up again— and after her twomarriages, even her son Sean thought, “She might have thought it wasn’t inthe cards for her,” but then she met Rob Wolders.

She was asked, “Did you ever think you’d fall in love again?”

“I didn’t think I’d have such serenity, which is hard to come by, someoneyou can trust and depend on. He’s absolutely there for me.”

Hang in there? Absolutely. At the end of the day, Audrey kept going. Afterwhatever disappointments she suffered, she kept them to herself, kept herchin up, and kept moving.

# Modern Times

"Audrey loved movies, loved movies. She admired her industry and Was a realpro.”

—Connie Wald

Audrey worked practically her whole life, and earned her own money.Although she was a very traditional wife, she always had her own gig, as wellas her own home in Switzerland, and her own agent, manager, and publicist.

In studying Audrey’s life, what comes through again and again (other thanher obvious talent) is how conscientiously she worked—whether it beUNICEF, or learning to sing for My Fair Lady, or dancing with Fred Astairein Funny Face. “Audrey did everything to the best of her abilities,” says RobWolders. “Which were considerable.”

What we see, too, is the joy she took in her work. For Audrey, it wasn’tabout fame, or getting a table in a good restaurant, or being on the cover of amagazine. Instead, she was very involved in the scripts she chose, and thedevelopment of her characters. Like most actors, she was always on thelookout for her next role, and had very high standards—wanting to work withthe best writers, directors, costars, and camera people.

And she did.

In 1964, after the success of My Fair Lady, she and George Cukor werekeeping their eyes open for another project to work on together. There wastalk of Oliver!, now on the London stage, or perhaps Peter Pan. Audrey andMel and baby Sean were happily ensconced in Tolochenaz (a long way fromBurbank, she noted, she was spending lots of time in the nursery), but Audreywent to see the performance of Oliver! and wrote a very insightfulassessment of the lead actress—of the entire production, in fact—that showsher intelligence and keen instincts.

Frankly, she wrote to Cukor, she found the actors’ work stale, as if theyhad done it too often, and then followed with a five-page assessment of theentire play. She thought that the lead actress yammered too much and ifOliver! were ever to be made into a movie, it should be more “Dickensian,sepia, moody, and real.”

In Audrey, we see that, in the end, it is the work that really matters. It isabout being a professional, operating at your highest level. It isn’t aboutwinning American Idol or appearing on a reality show to become famous.

The talent comes first, of course. But after that, the work is what reallymatters.

# A Rare (Almost) Misstep ...

In what would have been one of the worst career moves in history(right up there with selling Manhattan to the Dutch, or turning down thechance to buy Intel stock in 1984), Mel Ferrer did not want Audrey totake the role of Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, as he wasrather puritanical and did not want her to play a party girl (even if shewas Givenchy clad and enjoying a chaste friendship with the then-dreamy George Peppard). Fortunately for us, Audrey said yes and wenton to create one of the most iconic roles in cinematic history. Cananyone walk past Tiffany’s on Fifty-seventh Street early on a springmorning without the opening lines of “Moon River” running throughtheir mind?

We didn’t think so.27

By the 1960s, Audrey was at the top of her game. With the critical andcommercial success of a string of films, she took increasing risks, playing anun (The Nun’s Story), a lesbian (The Children’s Hour), a blind woman (WaitUntil Dark), and even, in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a prostitute (albeit anexceedingly well dressed one). It says something about her acting ability—orperhaps, really, her personality—that audiences accepted her in almost anyrole.

But while Audrey was flourishing professionally, there was trouble at LaPaisible. Rumors of the Ferrers’ imminent separation had been hoveringaround them for the past decade. Now it seemed their relationship was trulyplayed out. Although it is impossible to guess what goes on in anyrelationship, part of it may have been that Audrey had moved beyond Mel’sopinionated manner or had grown tired of constantly trying to placate him.Surely some friction must have arisen from the reality that her career sothoroughly eclipsed his.

While she and Ferrer collaborated on several projects through the years

Ondine on Broadway (1954), the films War and Peace (1956) and GreenMansions (1959)—Audrey’s star was clearly ascending. Alone. And althoughthe projects Mel developed were artistically creative, they were unsuccessfulat the box office—the only thing that matters in Hollywood. It must havebeen heartbreaking for a man of Mel’s considerable ambition, talent, anddrive to be known as “Mr. Audrey Hepburn.”

Part of the difficulty may have also been his personality. In a businesswhere there are few secrets, everyone loved Audrey. Her husband, on theother hand, usually merited a rolling of the eyes. “Mel was a pain in the ass,”confided more than one person who worked with Audrey and had dealingswith Mel. “He was always hanging around and meddling with the picture.”

In Mel’s defense, actresses in those days were not known to have a lot of“juice” in Hollywood, even those with Audrey’s considerable star power. Inthe movie business, you needed someone in your corner. You needed anenforcer, and Mel was the enforcer.

Robert Wolders, for his part, feels Mel’s contribution to Audrey’s careerwas incalculable. “Mel guided Audrey as a husband, not as a Svengali, assome would have you think. And I think the years of her marriage coincidewith the most successful years of her career.”

Years later, the Wilders have their own view of Audrey’s marital dilemma.

“I don’t think Mel was the proper husband,” observed Billy Wilderrhetorically, “but then again—who would have been the proper husband forher?”

Audrey’s money was on William Holden. “Well, Bill was a nice guy. Billwould have been better—if he’d been sober.”

# OUR FAVORITE AUDREY MOVIE 28

“Bitch.”

“Bastard.”

So ends Two for the Road, Audrey’s most grown-up film to date.

In this Stanley Donen picture, Audrey played Joanna Wallace, theextremely chic but long-suffering wife of Mark, played by Albert Finney, anegomaniacal, absentminded architect. A thoroughly grown-up story, they areboth cheating on each other. They love each other, but they also (at times)

hate each other. With this final line of dialogue, Audrey closed the door onthe princess, the gamine sprite, the dream.

Released in 1967, the gossamer roles of the 1950s and mid 1960s wereover. The reign of the studio was also ending. Even Jack Warner would sellhis beloved Warner Bros. to Seven Arts Productions in 1967. After hisretirement in Palm Springs (which he hated), he surveyed the new worldorder: “You’re nothing if you don’t have a studio. Now I’m just anothermillionaire, and there are a lot of ’em around.”

Within a year, America would be in flames. In 1968, Martin Luther King,Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy would be assassinated, with Woodstock,Altamont, Kent State, and Watergate to come.

Clearly, the world was changing.

Stanley Donen, who had started out as a Broadway hoofer in the 1940s, haddirected Audrey in Funny Face with Fred Astaire, and in Charade with CaryGrant. For Audrey and her costars, these were two great experiences.

Working with Audrey was memorable for Donen, too. “Our passion haslasted through four marriages—two of hers and two of mine.” He knew thatwhen you are on a set with someone, you get to see what they are really like.

Donen (who went on to marry three more times) said of Audrey, “Believeme, you get to know a person if you’ve gone through thirty-five years andthree movies with her. Everyone with an important job is in an anxious,difficult, pressured situation, and it’s particularly anxiety making for the leadactors. Their routine is to get up in the morning around 5:00 a.m. and putthemselves on display for anyone and everyone to see, discuss, analyze, anddissect. It takes guts to go through twelve to sixteen weeks, fourteen hours aday, six days a week of the torture of having all the attention focused on youand every move you make considered, of being asked to do this on this word,go there, be ready, be sad, be happy, be funny and not become difficult.

“Audrey was fun to be with from the beginning of shooting a movie to theend.”

Now Stanley had another idea for a picture—called Two for the Road. Itwould use time and travel to show the vagaries of a modern couple’smarriage from courtship through boredom, success, infidelity, possibledivorce, and whatever came next.

At first, Audrey was uncertain about the project. Always an instinctiveactor, she knew it would ask a great deal of her emotionally, perhaps things

that she did not wish to face. Mel saw its potential immediately and urged herto accept the role.

Although the script was written with her in mind, Donen knew he wouldbe lucky to get her. He knew Audrey “was equally devoted to her acting. Herstandards were high, and she was careful in choosing her parts and films.”During an interview for My Fair Lady, a reporter asked Audrey how shechose her roles.

“It’s very hard to say—I just like it, or it doesn’t strike me as somethingI’d particularly like to do.”

“Does it ever boil down to the business end of it?”

“In other words, have I ever done a picture for the money?”

“Yes—for the money.”

“No, never.” Audrey smiled. “Never. I’ve never done that. . . . I think mostpeople—most performers in general—have a dream when they start a picture,and think they have something very good and sometimes the quality falls bythe wayside for whatever reason. Even if they make a good picture, theaudience doesn’t always like it. It’s a very tenuous thing, you know.”

“Do you follow your instincts?” the reporter wondered. “Do you say toyourself—this is what I think, and this is what I want to do, and is thedecision yours, or does anyone help you make the decision?”

“I was born with my own instincts which I try to stay true to, and so far it’smade me very happy.”

Finally, the reporter wondered, “Do you find it very difficult in thisbusiness to stay true to your instincts?”

No, said Audrey. “It’s never been hard for me, and that’s why I’m sayingthat humbly, that I’m saying that perhaps I’m a really fortunate personbecause I followed my instincts and they’ve brought me nothing but blessingsand good fortune and kind people to work with, so so far, it’s been all right.”

Another factor that affected her decision was the fact that Albert Finney—who had recently made a splash in Tom Jones—would be her costar.Recently lauded as one of the “Angry Young Men” of British cinema, Albie(as she would come to call him) was rowdy, wild, stocky, a little uncouth,and seven years Audrey’s junior. No Fred Astaire or Cary Grant smoothie, hewould definitely push Audrey and wake up her image cinematically.

She decided to work with Stanley once more.

In addition to expanding her boundaries emotionally, Two for the Road was

groove-alicious, fashionwise. Instead of her usual perfectly constructedGivenchy ensembles, Donen sent Audrey down King’s Road in London withfashion coordinator Lady Claire Rendlesham to buy about thirty pieces offthe rack. Audrey protested at first, but Donen persuaded her that her characterwould not jet off to Paris for the couture, and to trust him. So she did, pickingup mostly Mary Quant, with a dash of Hardy Amies, Michelle Posier, PacoRabanne, and other mod designers of the day.

Although not many people knew it, Audrey and Stanley actually had ahistory in this regard. During Funny Face, when Audrey— wearing a blackturtleneck, cropped black pants, and black flats— danced in the beatnikbistro, she and her director had a mild clash when she did not agree with hisvision. Stanley wanted Audrey to wear white socks with the black ensembleso she would not entirely disappear in the scene. Audrey, for her part, wasexceedingly self-conscious about what she considered to be her large feet. Itwent back and forth a bit: Audrey wanted black socks to keep the line,Stanley wanted his white socks. Finally, Stanley put his foot down (so tospeak), letting Audrey know that he was the director and he wanted the whitesocks. He was polite about it, but at the end of the day, this was his show.

It was said that Audrey burst into tears at their disagreement— althoughshe didn’t remember it that way. At any rate, being the pro she was, she worethe socks and put everything she had into the scene (now a classic).

When she saw a final cut of the film, she sent Stanley a handwritten note:“You were right about the socks. Love, Audrey.”

So instead of the careful Givenchy suits seen in Paris When It Sizzles orCharade, Audrey departed from her typical image, wearing everything fromjeans and sneakers to a red and orange rugby-striped minidress withoversized acrylic sunglasses, to a black patent leather pantsuit cut so sharply,Jim Morrison would have loved it. There was a bathing suit scene that causedher great consternation at the time (not to worry—Audrey looked amazing).She even had a nude scene with Albert Finney, although, following themoviemaking dictums of the era, Finney wore white boxer shorts and a T-shirt, while Audrey kept the sheet pulled firmly up at all times, revealingabout as much décolletage as a strapless evening gown.

But still, she got points for trying.

While rumors of Audrey’s romances with one or another of her costars hadoccasionally floated about (more true on her husband’s side, more untrue on

hers), this time, with Albert Finney—it was the real thing.

“I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think it’s the thing I likemost, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It’s probably the most importantthing in a person.” And god knows, Albie and Audrey had a lot of laughsfilming Two for the Road in France.

For his part, Finney was both discreet and honest. “We got onimmediately. After the first day’s rehearsals, I could tell that the relationshipwould work out wonderfully. Either the chemistry is there, or it isn’t. . . .That happened with Audrey. During a scene with her, my mind knew I wasacting but my heart didn’t, and my body certainly didn’t! With a woman assexy as Audrey, you sometimes get to the edge where make-believe andreality are blurred. All that staring into each other’s eyes . . .

“People are always asking me if I’m going to marry her. . . . I won’tdiscuss it more because of the degree of intimacy involved. The time spentwith Audrey is one of the closest I’ve ever had.”

After shooting, they would duck off to little out-of-the-way cafés. StanleyDonen said that “the Audrey I saw during the making of this film I didn’teven know. She overwhelmed me—she was so free, so happy. I never sawher like that, so young! I guess it was Albie.”

For the first time in a long while, Audrey was happy. Of course, no matterwhat the gossip magazines said, she and Finney could not go too far—although separated, she and Mel were on good terms, and she did not want todo anything to jeopardize her custody of Sean.

Years later, she confided, “The most important thing is to enjoy your life—be happy—it’s all that matters,” and surely, this must have been somethingshe learned during her time making Two for the Road.

# Off the Record

A backstage story from the movie: There was a comic scene whereAudrey’s and Albie’s characters have an argument and Albie picks herup and drops her into the pool. Although few people knew it, Audreyhad a morbid fear of getting her head wet under water. Even at LaPaisible, she swam in the pool with her head held way above the water.

Rob remembers that he used to worry about her straining her neck.

“Can I use a double?” she asked Donen.

“Audrey, this is a scene I can’t possibly shoot with a double. Peoplehave to be able to recognize it’s you being thrown in.”

“Well,” she said. “If Albie throws me in, I may well have a heartattack.”

It took three days of coaxing to get her into the pool. She wasnervous about it, and Donen even poured water over her hair so shewould not have to duck her head under water to get it wet. Twoassistant directors were in the pool outside of camera range the entiretime, in case Audrey (somehow) got into trouble.

Roll tape.

The two ADs, cognizant, perhaps, that they were responsible for thewell-being of one of the most beloved women in the world, mistimedtheir dive into the water to rescue a sputtering Audrey Hepburn, and thescene had to be redone.

But still, even with days like that, Two for the Road was a blast forAudrey.

When Two for the Road opened at Radio City Music Hall on April 27,1967, to ecstatic reviews, many felt that it was her best performance in years,perhaps ever—and Henry Mancini’s theme will break your heart (in a goodway). If you have never heard its grown-up blend of sophistication, hope, andheartbreak—his best since “Moon River”—you owe it to yourself todownload it onto your iPod pronto.

For her part, Audrey Wilder also considered Two for the Road one ofAudrey’s best.

“I was crazy about Two for the Road and thought she really let herdefenses down in it. That was a real person. She let herself be seen in not thebest light. . . . Actresses all try to protect themselves usually. That’s thenature of the beast. But she’s really real in that.”

Unfortunately, neither their best intentions nor Audrey’s success wereenough to keep the relationship with Mel together. While Audrey attemptedto make the relationship work for the sake of her six-year-old son, Sean, theirunion ultimately ended. Having been married thirteen years, suffering fourmiscarriages and increasing tensions between their careers, Ferrer and

Unlike most actors (including her husband Mel), Audrey hated talking aboutherself. Hated hated hated it. But she was always most grateful to have beenable to make a living as an actress. And she was most grateful for it all. At asalute in her honor at Lincoln Center in 1991, she said:

# AUDREY TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS

Audrey lived well. She had created, as Connie Wald says, “a beautiful life.”She had an amazing home in Switzerland, designer clothes, Frette sheets,help, and an Audi (if any of this matters to you). But she also—and this is thevery cool AH dichotomy—watched her finances, was not profligate, anddefinitely took care of the bottom line. Like many of us, her marriages didnot last forever, so she was largely responsible for taking care of her twoboys, as well as helping out her parents.

And not to put too fine a point on it—because this whole conversationwould probably kill Audrey because she was so private—while Audrey was

truly “famous” and an Oscar winner, she was a movie star in the time beforeactresses got $\$ 29$ million a picture. Still, she was very well paid for what shedid—along with Elizabeth Taylor, she was the highest-paid actress of her era.And her agent, Kurt Frings, negotiated some very good deals for her. Sowhile Audrey lived the high life when she was a globe-trotting actress, at theend of her life, she scaled back and flew coach when traveling for UNICEF.

As a single working mother for much of her adult life, Audrey was verygood with money. She owned her own home and had some very goodannuities to take care of the bottom line for both herself and her family.

So whether we are single or married, working or raising a family (or, mostlikely, both), here are some AH Money Tips from one of the most Audrey-esque women we know, Mellody Hobson, President of Ariel CapitalManagement, LLC.

Clip them. Save them. Study them. Put them on your bathroom mirror, ifyou must, but pay attention.

# THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MELLODY

1. “Make sure that you know where the money is. I say that to women whoare married because often they make their biggest financial decisions in timesof great emotional distress—death or divorce. Know the account numbers,know the contact information for your financial institutions.”

2. “If you are married, always maintain some form of financial independence—that might be one credit card, one banking account. This allows you tomaintain your own credit history, so that if you had to re-establish it on yourown, you could do it. So just one thing. It’s not about separate, it’s aboutmaking sure that you have some form of a financial identity that’s separatefrom your spouse.”

3. “If you’re not married, I use this example that I heard from Judy Collins,‘As women we are raised to have rescue fantasies, and I’m here to tell you—no one is coming.’ I call it the white knight syndrome, and as girls we areraised to read fairy tales, and the prince will come, and I always say lead yourlife as if there’s no prince, and that way you’ll be prepared and you’ll have asafety net.

“A lot of women delay saving and investing, thinking, ‘When my husband

comes we’ll figure it out.’ Taking charge now makes a huge difference andgives you financial independence regardless of the outcome.”

Hobson believes that “as women we are caretakers and nurturers by nature.Because of that, when it comes to thinking of our own retirement andfinancial security, our first thought is always to put others first, particularlyour children.

“If it’s a question of you funding your retirement IRA or Jimmy going tocamp, you’re going to want Jimmy to go to camp, right? The big dilemmathat a lot of women have is—especially single moms— do I save for myretirement, or do I save for my kid’s college education, and the example that Igive is that when you’re on an airplane and you hit turbulence and the oxygenmask drops, they say, ‘Put yourself first, and then help the person next toyou.’

“The same is true when thinking about your financial future; you have tosave for your retirement first, and then you can think about your children’seducation next because at twenty-two, you are infinitely more capable ofgetting out of debt if you’ve got college loans, than at eighty-five.”

Financially, Audrey took care of business (and then some), and this isinformation we can all use today.

# JUST WHO IS . . . VERY AUDREY?

“I never think of myself as an icon. What is in other people’s minds isnot in my mind. I just do my thing.”—AH

Describing someone or something as “very Audrey” is a fashionista’s way ofsaying extremely cool. In this very singular (and very debatable) list we’vegot the women and even the men who have Audrey Style. While we don’tbegrudge anyone for skipping ahead to see if they’ve made the list, we lookforward to the inevitable fisticuffs at Vogue.

While no one can beat Audrey in the gamine department—for style,intelligence, generosity, and historical cognizance (with bonus points for herability to rock the short haircut), Natalie Portman is our personal number-onecontender for Most Audrey-esque. But recognizing that we also have to livein the real world . . . is there anyone, really, who can take Miss Hepburn’splace?

Designer Jeffrey Banks, a lifelong friend of Audrey’s, would say no.“There is only one Audrey, and there will always only be one Audrey—ever!” But a girl’s got to dream, right? So if we had to choose some Audrey-esque Gals We Love . . .

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Get paid top dollar? Yes. For a good decade, Audrey (along with ElizabethTaylor) was the highest-paid actress in the world. For My Fair Lady, forexample, she received the then staggering $1 million. Her agent arranged forseven annual payments of $142,957.00, in order to help Audrey reduce hertax liability.

Keep an eye on the details? Yes. Although she did not negotiate thempersonally, she knew the ins and outs of her contracts. In a 1953 interviewwith Hedda Hopper, the twenty-four-year-old actress knowledgeablydiscussed her contract with the ease of a William Morris pro.

When Hopper commented that she might have gotten more money if shehad waited to sign with Paramount after her successful Broadway run of Gigi,Audrey said, “I have very good agents, if I deserve more money, I’ll get it. . .. It’s a seven-picture contract, with twelve months between the financing date

of one picture and the starting date of the next. I can do stage and televisionduring the twelve months. I can do a second picture for another company, butParamount has pre-empt rights.”

Fight for creative freedom? Yes. In the Hollywood community, Audrey wasknown for saying “no” more than “yes.” After her first success, in RomanHoliday, the offers poured in and she could pick and choose her projects.Over the course of her career she worked with William Wyler, Billy Wilder,Stanley Donen, and Peter Bogdanovich, and turned down far more work thanshe accepted—among them, The Diary of Anne Frank, Oliver Twist!, ABridge Too Far, The Turning Point, and even Out of Africa (starring MerylStreep and Robert Redford, which won seven Academy Awards).

Watch her dailies? No. AH was the rare Hollywood actor who could not bearto watch the daily rushes of her work.

Voice her opinion? Yes. Although she was wonderfully mannered, andalways cognizant of the director’s role, Audrey spoke up when it counted. Atan early screening of Breakfast at Tiffany’s in San Francisco, Paramount’snew president decided, “Well, I’ll tell you one thing, we can get rid of thatdamn song. . . .” (meaning “Moon River”)

Audrey leaped out of her seat in a rare loss of self-control and said, “Overmy dead body!”

It stayed.

Invest in real estate? Absolutely. In addition to La Paisible, she also, atvarious times in her life, owned a vacation place in Spain and an apartment inGstaad. When Sean married for the first time in 1985, Audrey bought him a$375,000 house in the Hollywood Hills.

Be financially aware? Yes. During the filming of Roman Holiday, theproducers were amazed when, at the conclusion of filming, Audrey gavethem an itemized report of her daily expenses, as well as returning herunspent per diem allowance. They declined to accept it.

Appear in a commercial? If you said “no,” you just lost a bet.

In 1971, Audrey made her first—and only—commercial, for a collectionof wigs from a Japanese company called Varie. Shot in Rome over a two-dayperiod, she made the astonishing amount of $\$ 100,000$ , which she theninvested in annuities for Sean and Luca. Her contract stipulated that the fourone-minute commercials would never appear outside of Japan, and so far,they have not. Nor have they ever appeared on You Tube.

Ever make a few clunkers? Yes. Although they have their fans, Paris When ItSizzles, War and Peace, and Green Mansions are not considered her bestwork. However, AH remembered Paris When It Sizzles as a joy to make(albeit with a convoluted and almost nonexistent script), which is why shetold Sean not to “correlate the experience of making the movie with itsoutcome.”

Mess up once in a while? Sure. When she met Cary Grant in 1962, just beforeshe was to begin filming Charade, she was so nervous that she spilled abottle of red wine on his immaculate cream-colored suit. Grant, ever thegentleman, took his jacket off and continued with the meal. (He evenencouraged Audrey to take a few deep breaths and relax.)

The next day, he sent Audrey a tin of caviar with a note telling her not toworry about it.

Director Stanley Donen, who was with them at dinner, used the scene togreat comic effect in the movie, when AH accidentally smushes her ice-cream cone on the lapel of Grant’s suit.

Remain professional, in Spite Of On-Set dramas? Yes. During the making ofMy Fair Lady (which was grueling), AH was under tremendous pressure,working sixteen-hour days, trying to give the director, George Cukor, whathe wanted, taking dancing and singing lessons, working with musical directorAndré Previn to learn her singing parts (later dubbed by Marni Nixon . . .which no one had the courage to tell AH). She lost fifteen pounds from stress,George Cukor was in the midst of a battle with Cecil Beaton over his abilityto photograph Audrey on set, plus a jewelry bag containing her wedding ringwas stolen.

Her marriage to Mel Ferrer, rumored to be fraying for years, was also inshambles. Although set photographer Bob Willoughby recalls loud wordscoming from her dressing room, Audrey was nothing but positive,professional, and upbeat in front of the crew.

Have the final edit? No. In the studio system, no actors or directors had thiskind of pull.

Ever take acting lessons? No. When Hedda Hopper asked if she had everstudied acting, Audrey said that she relied on her instincts. “My acting mustcome from the inside—there is no other place it could come from. I can’t fallback on technique. It can’t come from any other place.”

What we saw on screen (or in her life) was Pure Audrey.

Get sold out by the National Enquirer? No, because frankly, there wasnothing to tell. Stu Crowner, who worked with AH on Gardens of the World,said, “She was a bitch! [laughter] Well, what do you think! If somebody wasgoing to do a National Enquirer thing, I wouldn’t have a single thing to say.She took care of the crew, she nursed us, she was a friend to us, she wasprofessional, which was the best kind of friend you could be! She was ontime, she had her words down, she contributed to the script. . . . And then shelooked wonderful, of course.

“She was very generous with her spirit and very generous with how youfelt. In other words, she considered how you felt rather than how she felt.Maybe she took care of herself, her psyche, and her soul, and all those things,but it wasn’t at the expense of her friends or colleagues.”

Give it her all? Yes. As Stanley Donen recalled, “She wanted only the bestand fought for it. She took her work very seriously; on the set she was alwaysin good spirits, always on time. . . . She approached acting withdetermination, intelligence and a lack of selfishness I have rarely seen.”

Stay loyal in the most cutthroat industry in the world? Yes. Audrey wasimmensely loyal. Whether in business or personal relationships, once shetrusted you, that was it. (So if someone disappointed her, she felt that evenmore strongly.)

Audrey surrounded herself with very good people, and remained true tothem for years. She stayed close friends with Billy Wilder, her director onSabrina and Love in the Afternoon, and his wife, Audrey. She worked withdirectors William Wyler and Stanley Donen several times. She first metHubert de Givenchy while filming Sabrina, and he went on to become theexecutor of her estate. Similarly, she first met her agent, Kurt Frings, and herlongtime hair and makeup team during Roman Holiday, and stayed with themthe rest of their lives.

Fire her publicist? Yes. During her marriage to Mel, he was annoyed thatGivenchy used Audrey’s image in an ad for a perfume he had created for her,L’Interdit, and did not pay her. Givenchy was more than willing to do so, butAudrey did not want him to, believing that that’s what friends do for oneanother. Mel enlisted Henry Rogers, Audrey’s respected publicist, to go toParis and begin negotiations with Hubert’s brother.

When Audrey learned of this, as well as a trumped-up award— Melwanted the Cannes Film Festival to award Audrey to get her to attend—she

said, “Neither of you seem to understand. I don’t want anything from Hubert.I don’t need his money. He is my friend. If I have helped him build hisperfume business, then that’s exactly what one friend should do for another. .. . Yes, I even want to walk into a drugstore and buy the perfume at the retailprice.”

Later that night she called Rogers, weeping. At first, he was alarmed andthought something had happened to Sean. Audrey was upset at all thebackstage machinations going on around her, and the feeling that otherpeople expected her to cash in on her friendship with Givenchy.

She said that while she valued his friendship, she could not work with himanymore. She was upset about his embarrassing her about Hubert and tryingto get her to accept some phony award.

Rogers felt terrible. Here was this generous, creative creature sobbing hereyes out over the machinations of Hollywood. Part of the difficulty ofworking with Audrey was the fact that Audrey wanted to work less and Melwas always pushing her out there—more more more more. As publicist,Henry had to serve two masters and “performed a constant balancing actbetween Mel’s insatiable desire for Audrey’s new publicity, and herreluctance.”

Rogers explained how he saw the situation, and his peripheral part in it,and graciously accepted Audrey’s wishes. And yes, they remained friends.

# chapter 9

# St. Audrey

“Life’s most persistent and Urgent question is, ‘What are you doing forothers?’ ”

—Martin Luther King, Jr.

Audrey had enjoyed such great fortune as an actress. Now, it was time to giveback. In 1988, she was asked to serve as Special Ambassador for the UnitedNations Children’s Fund. “I auditioned for this job for forty-five years,” shesaid, “and I finally got it.” Once it was learned that Audrey was on board, theinvitations poured in from around the world—“and in our enthusiasm, weaccepted all of them,” says Wolders.

In the space of five years, they made more than fifty humanitarian trips—to Japan, Turkey, Holland, Central America, El Salvador, Vietnam, andAustralia. Long before actors like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, or AngelinaJolie, Audrey was one of the first celebrities to go to places like Bangladesh,Ethiopia, and Sudan.

For Audrey, her commitment to UNICEF was nothing out of the ordinary.While some might see her devotion to her work as extraordinary, shebelieved that “it is logic that someone who has been privileged should dosomething for those who are not. Again, that was the way I was brought up.”In fact, Audrey believed that through her work with UNICEF, she receivedeven more than she gave.

“It’s an extraordinary thing that’s happened to me. To be able to expressmy need to help children and to care for them in some way. I personally cando very little, but I can contribute to a whole chain of events which isUNICEF, and that’s a marvelous feeling! It’s like a bonus to me at the end ofmy life. And if this career has given me something very special, it’s the factthat it’s left me with whatever this is—this voice, this curiosity that peoplestill have to see me, to talk to me—which I can use for the good of children.What could be nicer?”

And so, the third act of Audrey’s life began.

For Audrey and Rob, their devotion to UNICEF was immediate andlasting. “It was twenty-four hours a day, in terms of study, preparation, the

speeches, then the field trips,” Rob recalls. Audrey approached her work withthe attentiveness with which she used to prepare for a role; writing her ownspeeches at her dining room table, speaking to journalists in their nativelanguage, and when they traveled, it was just she and Rob on a transportplane—not a film crew from Entertainment Tonight covering their everymove.

She just went out and did it. John Isaac, a UNICEF photographer andfriend, said that the organization “got $\$ 1$ million in contributions every timeshe made an appeal to Barbara Walters, or wherever. She made such a hugeimpression.”

Isaac first met Audrey on her trip to Ethiopia in 1988. As he recalls, “Wehit it off right from the beginning, and she had a terrific sense of humor, sowe could joke about things, and at the same time, she was very sensitive. Andshe also had a very philosophical edge to her, she liked philosophy, she likedTagore. . . . I told her I had a favorite poet, and she said that she had afavorite, too. So then we exchanged the same lines. He talks about love in away, he talks about true friendship, true love, he says: ‘May my loving younot be a burden on you, for I freely chose to love you.’ And it’s almost like atrue love where you don’t expect anything.

“Audrey was so deep and so sensitive. In no way would she want to offendanybody, even though there were people who were starving, and who weredying over there. But for her, dignity was so important.” Isaac saw thisfirsthand when he traveled with Audrey and Rob to Bangladesh in October1989. “Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just gohug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount ofhesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to holdher hand, touch her— she was like the Pied Piper.”

But still, among the press, there were some snipers. As Rob recalls, “Whenshe did the UNICEF work, people would refer to her as if she were a saint,and that puzzled her and ultimately made her a little angry because peoplewould compare her to a Mother Teresa. At the same time, one shouldn’tunderplay the importance that she came to have in her charitable efforts—it’sremarkable in those few years, in regard to drawing attention to the plight ofthe children.”

# The Only Club Audrey Would Have Joined

While Audrey was a perennial member of any Best Dressed Listanyone can conjure up (still), she was not a joiner and, other than abeach club she went to in Sardinia in the late 1960s so Sean would havea place to swim, was not a club member.

However, we think there is one club she would have joined: TheCouncil on Foreign Relations, the influential, nonpartisan foreignpolicy organization founded in 1921 and housed in a former Frickmansion on Park Avenue in New York City. With politically savvymembers of the East Coast aristocracy like Madeleine Albright, TomBrokaw, Richard Holbrooke, Henry Kravis, Colin Powell, DavidRockefeller, and newbie Angelina Jolie, we have no doubt she wouldhave fit right in.

Although her contribution to UNICEF was considerable and her impactincalculable, Audrey was not exactly living in exile in Switzerland, orconstantly traveling for relief efforts. Her equal priorities were her family andfriends. In fact, she was so successful in her effort to raise Sean and Luca in a“normal” environment that it was only when Sean started working in themovie business in his early twenties that he realized that she “was a hugestar.”

# AUDREY AND HER FANS . . .

One of the hallmarks of Audrey Fans is how well behaved they are. Whenasked how Audrey managed to make her way around major cities without theuse of a bodyguard or hiding out in a Cadillac Escalade with tinted windows,Rob said, “It was really remarkable because people were so respectful of her.They would follow her. I saw people stop in their tracks in places like NewYork and then very shyly come up to her, and say, ‘My god, you look likeAudrey Hepburn!’ She was so extraordinarily kind with them.

“The only time it would be bothersome,” Rob recalled, “would be if wewould be leaving some event, these people have some sort of undergroundnetwork, they knew she was there. And there would be dozens of thesepeople with these stacks of photographs and then I or Sean would have tocurb it because they would give her ten photographs to sign.”

# They All Laughed. Not.

Although Audrey would go on to have a cameo (as an angel, natch)in Steven Spielberg’s Always, her last starring role was in PeterBogdanovich’s wildly self-indulgent They All Laughed.

We are not going to recap the plot, which also stars John Ritter,Dorothy Stratten, Patti Hansen, and Ben Gazzara. While Vincent Canbypanned it the first time around in The New York Times (not withoutreason, most would say), this 1981 film has gone on to become a cultfavorite of directors like Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson.

Overlooking plot, dialogue, pacing, and an excessive use of physicalsight gags (mostly on the part of Ritter), should you decide to rent itfrom Netflix, They All Laughed is worth watching if only:

1. To see Audrey walk so freely through Midtown Manhattan. Andher friends are right, she walks fast. Not surprisingly, she looks terrificin her own wardrobe of jeans and silk shirts (note that the lining of herpea coat matches her shirt), and the occasional Burberry trench.

2. Notice how openly affectionate she is with Glenn Scarpelli (whoplays Michael Niotes, her movie son). It is obvious from watching thetwo of them interact that she truly loves children. She is far morephysically demonstrative, and comfortable, with him than with her(movie) love interest, Ben Gazzara.

3. In addition to working as Bogdanovich’s personal assistant, Seanmakes an appearance as a slightly uncomprehending Latin (or is he anItalian?) playboy. It is easy to see why Audrey was so proud of him.

4. To see late 1970s New York City in all of its gritty, precleaned-uptourist-era glory. For the roller disco, women’s (and men’s) fashions,the World Trade Center, downtown when it was still downtown, andcharacters’ propensity to casually share joints and/or pick up membersof the opposite sex: priceless. Oh, and everybody smokes constantlythroughout the entire movie.

5. Well, she did earn $\$ 1$ million for six weeks’ work, with a generousexpense account.

6. Audrey had her first real “date” (although they would not havecalled it that) with Robert Wolders at this time.

If her eyes are a bit sadder, a bit more knowing than when we firstsaw her in Roman Holiday, Audrey has lost none of her beauty. Ifanything, her knowledge of the ways of the world make us care for hereven more. Still, as much as we love her—and her work—our Audreyis ill-served by the entire endeavor.

# AUDREY AND ROB: THE INSIDE STORY

Rob had always felt that he and Audrey were fated to meet.

They were so similar in their thoughtfulness, their low-key-ness (so unAmerican), their attention to detail and quiet good charm. If you ever wonderwhat Audrey must have been like, meet Rob.

As he says of their relationship, “We had the good fortune to find eachother, and I had gone through some bad stuff as well. We had no friction orhardships, really, except for some of the petty things which were easilysettled.”

In addition to her intelligence, generosity of spirit, and obvious beauty(which Rob swears Audrey did not really see in herself), what Rob also lovedabout Audrey were her “moments of glad grace.” She could be dignifiedwhen the moment called for it, but also loved to joke around. Rob says that“when she got older and she would be clowning around with kids in the fieldor if a meeting got too serious, she would lighten up the situation, and severaltimes she would say to me, ‘I really can’t behave like this at my age, can I?’and I would always encourage her to not change.

“She was full of beans, full of fun, full of mischief, and didn’t think thatshe had a superior quality. Which is interesting, you presume that people whoproject glamour and confidence, security, that they have perhaps always hadit, or that they arrived at it and take it for granted. With Audrey, that wasnever the case.”

One of Our Favorite 1980s AH Quotes

“This chocolate is so good, I could rub it in my hair!”

—Audrey, to Rob

# WHAT AUDREY AND OPRAH HAVE IN COMMON

Long before Oprah had to answer the tiresome (and far from original) “Whyaren’t you married?” question, Audrey had to deal with it in the press again.

And again.

And again.

Even Barbara Walters got into the act, asking if—or when—she and Robplanned to marry. “We are married,” Audrey answered, “just not formally.”She also quoted one of Billy Wilder’s lines: “If you have a winningcombination—you don’t fool with it! So I’m not going to fool with anything!We’re very happy this way—we don’t need marriage!”

Besides, Rob always believed that the end of each of her marriages was soharrowing for someone as finely tuned as Audrey that he never would havedreamed of putting her through that. It would be, he said, “like draggingsomeone back to the electric chair and making her sit down again.” Much ashe loved her—and she him—it would never happen.

# The Golden Boy: The Update

Audrey’s divorce from Mel was so emotionally traumatic that sheonly saw him twice afterward—at Sean’s graduation and first wedding.(And this from a woman who was able to forgive and support her Nazi-inclined father, who deserted her and her mother on the eve of WorldWar II). She remained friends with Andrea, mainly for Luca’s sake. Butwhat of Bill Holden, the Golden Boy?

Personally, things did not turn out so well for him. After his earlysuccess in Hollywood, Bill Holden lost energy in his middle years,appearing in mostly lackluster films and not seeming to care all thatmuch about acting. In 1966, his drinking took a darker turn when hewas involved in a car accident in Italy in which the other driver waskilled. It was determined that Holden had been driving under theinfluence of alcohol. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter andreceived an eight-month suspended prison sentence.

While appearing in movies such as The Wild Bunch, The ToweringInferno, and an Oscar-nominated performance in Networkin the 1970s,he devoted most of his time to wildlife preservation at his animal

preserve in Africa. His longtime relationship with actress StephaniePowers sparked his interest in animal welfare.

Holden died a dozen years before Audrey, in 1981, as a result of afall in his high-rise apartment in Santa Monica, California. Drunk andalone when he slipped on a throw rug, he was not found for four days.His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the PacificOcean. After his death, Stephanie Powers became a director of theMount Kenya Game Ranch and president of the William HoldenWildlife Foundation, whose work continues to this day.

Bob Willoughby, who knew both Audrey and Bill, once remarked,“Everyone was in love with Audrey, but no one more than Bill.”

# ADD STEVEN SPIELBERG TO THE LIST, TOO

In 1988, Audrey shot a cameo in Steven Spielberg’s Always. She and Robwere hesitant to accept the part—she plays a sort of heavenly angel in whitetrousers and a ribbed sweater who advises a character played by RichardDreyfuss—since they had been doing some very hard traveling for UNICEFfor the past four or five months, but she did (fortunately for us).

Rob recalls that Audrey needed a break, and was reluctant to do it, but theywere flown out to Montana and the production company had provided abeautiful house in the woods for them, and they had an entire week beforethey were needed on set, so it was almost like a holiday for them. Robremembers that Audrey was embarrassed, too, by all the adulation fromSpielberg, that most knowledgeable of directors—“They treated her likesome sort of a deity,” says Rob.

When it was time for her to be on the set, they did not want her whitecostume to get even the slightest smudge (her “heaven” was a burned-outforest), so the grips put her in a chair, picked her up, and carried her to herkey light, much to her delight and chagrin. “She had a great time,” Robrecalls. “She adored Steven.”

From a career that began in 1951, it was her last film role.

“I found her a singular person. Unique is a very overused word, butshe was unique—there was no one like her before, and there’s beenno one like her since.” —Gregory Peck

# AH Was Afraid Of

Getting her head dunked under water

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Get a tattoo, piercings, have a page On MySpace? Come on . . . Audrey didnot even have her ears pierced.

Visit a strip club? Actually, she did. Sort of. If visiting the famed burlesqueshow at the Crazy Horse in Paris counts. In 1959, Henry Wolf, the legendaryart director of Harper’s Bazaar, traveled with Richard Avedon to do a covershoot with Audrey, Mel, Buster Keaton, and Art Buchwald. Avedon took themain shots, but Henry shot a ton of backstage stuff.

One night, he took her to Crazy Horse at her request. He called to get atable and they said, no, they did not have any. He then asked, “Would youhave a table for Audrey Hepburn?” and of course they did. The show began,and one of the dancers came right up to the table, not recognizing Audrey,and when she did, nearly dropped her fans.

Stand on ceremony? No. When she visited the UN, the directors alwayswanted to have lunch with her and she said, no, she wanted to have lunchwith her friend, the UN photographer who accompanied her on her tripsabroad, John Isaac. Being the “low man on the totem pole” (in Isaac’swords), John was visited by a director who said he could not accept, becausethe directors would be upset.

John told Audrey that they would get together after work. “Why, are youbusy?” she wondered, and he said no, and after he explained the situation, shesaid, “Bullshit, you will be my escort!”

So they went to lunch together at the UN dining room. “I was her friend,and that was it,” Isaac recalled.

Consider herself a superwoman? No way. Just so we don’t leave you with theimpression that Audrey was some sort of a Superwoman who had everythingunder control at all times, in a letter to her father’s wife, Fidelma, in July1980, she confides that her marriage to Andrea is in bad shape, and she issuffering but keeping her head up and keeping going. “I am very torn aboutthis, but I can only do the best I can.”

Tone it down, style-wise? Yes. Even though Audrey was—and even today,continues to be—a style icon, she took her role lightly. She loved clothing,but when her life became less public, she was just as happy dressing casually.Rob recalled that “Audrey was in jeans 80 percent of the time. She woreballet-type slippers, always. On occasion, sandals or clogs in case she had tostep into the garden. A Lacoste shirt, no belt. She didn’t like belts, except ondresses, but on jeans, never.”

Use creative fund-raising techniques? Yes. Early on during her time atUNICEF, Audrey contributed a painting that she had done of an Ethiopianwoman with a single tear. It was sold at auction for $\$ 12,000$ , which boughtthree camels that were used to carry vaccines for children to Chad in CentralAfrica.

“Get” it? Yes. Kevin Aucoin did her makeup on numerous occasions. Thefirst time was when Richard Avedon shot her for a Revlon ad, and later whenshe got the Lincoln Center Film Society Award in 1991. As Kevin recalled,“She was very empathetic. There is a quality about her that is hard to putwords to . . . she was, of course, really smart and very discerning, so she hadthis amazing combination that made it sort of unbelievable.”

Kevin began talking to her about gay teen suicide and “she got it. Youcould really talk to her. She was very in touch and very aware.” Workingwith her was one of the great experiences of his life, and he thought “she hada really engaging presence that manifested itself in truth coming through hereyes. She was very there, you got her full attention. When you were talking toher, she was talking to you alone. And if she was talking about the flowersyou sent, she was talking about them alone. And you knew she meant what

she said.”

Know when to leave the stage? Yes. Unlike so many actors, she knew whento shift gears. According to Candy Pratts Price, “Audrey disappeared at theright time. Having a private life is key. And I think what we’re dealing withso much now is so many of these girls are not private, and never leaving.Audrey knew when to leave the party— you’ve got to arrive at the right time,and you’ve got to leave at the right time.

“And I think reserve. I think that’s the main thing—stay out of the damnparty! She must have been worshipped by the man she was with because shedid not need to sit at the banquette at El Morocco.”

But needless to say, given her talent, Audrey was always inundated withfilm offers and possible projects. After the success of Roman Holiday, sheadmitted, the offers came pouring in. At the time of Audrey’s death, JuliaRoberts was still looking for a project they could work on together.

Be politically radical? Yes, in her own way. “I am filled with a rage atourselves!” she told Larry King. “I don’t believe in collective guilt, but I dobelieve in collective responsibility.” She was invited to have an audience withPope John Paul II, but she declined, as she disagreed with the CatholicChurch’s teachings on birth control. Having traveled through CentralAmerica and Africa, she had seen the downside of such beliefs.

Speaking to a group of U.S. senators, she said, “We study war. Why can’twe study and have a science of peace?”

Follow her instincts? Yes, always. Audrey was a holistic person— turningher back on Hollywood, leaving her marriages (painful as that was) whenthey were no longer good for her, doing what she thought best for herself andher family—and now, it seemed her life was where she dreamed it might be.Her sons brought her great joy. She had challenging work that she loved andrewarded her. She had a beautiful home, and a true partner. There werechallenges, yes, but she moved ahead with things and did the best she could.Have been able to do her UNICEF work without Rob’s extremely ableassistance? No.

Keep it together? Yes. Cynthia Rowley noticed this, too. “I also love thatAudrey stayed with it her whole life, she didn’t give up. Crisp shirt, littleflats, or a sleeveless shell. People are like, oh no, I can’t wear sleeveless, myarms are too . . . she was like sixty and she’s still wearing sleeveless tops.”

Consider herself a saint? No. Way. (Although we might.) Actually, the whole

“saint” thing makes her less than human—by putting her up on a pedestal andmaking her better than us, Audrey is dehumanized, and this lessens herinherent coolness. While her work for UNICEF (as a private citizen) went farbeyond the bounds of mere charity, she was also a normal person—shesmoked, drank Scotch, let her dogs sleep on the bed, got lonely once in awhile, stayed at fivestar hotels, and got into the occasional tiff with hermother.

Write her autobiography? No, although the legendary agent Irving “Swifty”Lazar wrote her three-page, single-spaced letters beseeching her to do so, andJacqueline Kennedy Onassis regularly called her at home in Switzerland toalso try to persuade her.

Audrey turned everyone down, mainly because she was too busy living herlife in the present, but also, any decent life story, she knew, would have toinvolve other people, and she had no interest in betraying (as she saw it)others’ confidences.

Her son Sean wrote a beautiful photo-memoir about his mother’s life,Audrey Hepburn, An Elegant Spirit (Atria Books, 2003). AH would havebeen pleased.

# Legend

"I don’t know how long We last in people’s memories, but if anyone has theright to be remembered, she does.”

—Blake Edwards

In September 1992, Audrey and Rob went to Somalia for UNICEF. It washell, unimaginable. Beyond anything she had ever seen. There were so manygraves, and so many dead. For once, it was almost too much.

“I walked into a nightmare,” Audrey said. “I have seen famine in Ethiopiaand Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this—so much worse than Icould have possibly imagined. I wasn’t prepared for this.”

Upon their return, there was worse news. Audrey had been complaining ofsevere stomach pain. At first, the doctors thought it might be some sort of avirus. After extensive tests at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,they learned it was cancer, that dreaded fraternity.

Now, remembering the time before Audrey’s death is troubling for Rob.“When Audrey became ill, I asked her—this was a few months before theend—‘What if we had just spent the years that we had been fortunate enoughto be together? If we had spent those years here, in Switzerland, to betogether with the dogs, with the family,’ and it’s one of the few times that shewas quite angry with me, because it indicated a certain selfishness, and shesaid, ‘think of all we would have missed.’ ”

But nevertheless, admits Rob, “if I were to know for certain that theUNICEF work, which might have taken away from her years, from her life, Iwould not hesitate to give all that up, just so she would be with us longer.

“We had a blessed fourteen years, but when it is taken away, you suffer allthe more, because it was that good. We had no friction or hardships, really,except for some of the petty things, which were easily settled. Whatevershortcomings either one of us had—she had very few, I had many—sheaccepted. She made people better, and she would bring out the best in people.There was just no way of being mean with Audrey—even today, you know?People are hard put to say something bad about her.”

Her sons made the decision not to tell Audrey the extent of her prognosis. In

1988, she and John Isaac had had a conversation about who had the right tolife. As Isaac recalls, “She asked me and I said I think I have the right to myown life, and I said I don’t want to be hanging on to some tube. She said,‘Exactly, John, that’s exactly what I think.’

“Robbie called and also Sean wanted to know, when they made thedecision they asked me. That’s why she went in a dignified way.”

In retrospect, Rob realizes that might have been a mistake. “Neither theboys nor I would acknowledge that she was actually dying. We couldn’timagine that she could—she was too precious. And we made a mistake in notletting her know how ill she was. In retrospect, I think that was very unfair toher because she was as realistic about death as she was about life. When shebegan to sense what was happening, she made us promise that we would lether go when she would indicate that it was time. We promised to do that, butI don’t think we really followed through.”

With the realization of those forced to remain behind, he admitted, “Wewere begging for every minute, really.” Audrey’s unexpected illness affectedRob greatly, perhaps in ways, even now, he is barely aware of. “She was soextraordinarily giving and compassionate. She gave me a great deal of selfworth. Subsequently, I had a great sense of failure when she died, becauseshe made me feel that I could protect her. She entrusted herself to me.”

Thanks to the intervention of Hubert, Audrey, Rob, and the boys were ableto borrow Bunny Mellon’s plane and fly from Los Angeles to Switzerland.They spent their last Christmas together with a few close friends, such asHubert, visiting. “I’m so glad I’m home,” Audrey said. “I can see my treesagain.”

It was a terrible time. It was a beautiful time, too, to have these weekstogether. As Sean recalled, “We were, of course, shocked and dismayed andhorrified and angry, and she said no, death is just a part of life. It’s justanother phase of life. And she made peace with things. We had a wonderfulopportunity to say to each other all the things you want to be able to sharewith someone when you know they’re not going to be there. I think she feltthat her last Christmas was her best Christmas because, I can’t tell youexactly why, she felt at that time. We were all around her, we were there forthe right reasons. And she said she was now sure that we really loved her.”

During one of her last conversations with Sean, he asked her— did sheregret anything?

“I do regret something,” she said, “I regret not meeting the Dalai Lama. Heis probably the closest thing to God we have on this earth. So much humor . .. so much compassion . . . humanity.”

Audrey died at home in Tolochenaz, Switzerland, on January 20, 1993.She was sixty-three years old.

Years earlier, she had reflected on her life, “If my world were to cave intomorrow, I would look back on all the pleasures, excitements andworthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had. Not the sadness, notmy miscarriages or my father leaving home, but the joy of everything else. Itwill have been enough.”

Once, commenting on her own possible legacy, Audrey said simply, “I domy best. I wish I could do more.” While Rob knew that “if there is anythingshe would have wished for, it is that her work be continued.”

“I think people love her off the screen for the same reason they loveher performances—a kind of orderliness and formality.”—WilliamHolden

# Audrey Life Lessons

Never Complain, never explain.

Audrey was not a whiner. When things were stressful during thefilming of My Fair Lady, when Mel was being his usual pain-in-the-neck self, when her wedding ring was stolen from her dressing room,when her mother was cross with her—she didn’t complain. She kept herhead down and got on with it.

Conserve your energy for the important things.

Every once in a while, spend the day in bed to rest up between gigs. Inhis later years, Picasso had enormous energy. What most people don’tknow is, he spent one day in bed, resting, and one day up and about.Along with the occasional nap, Audrey made a point of conserving herenergy between film jobs.

Don’t be a whiner.

When she was diagnosed with cancer Audrey did not say, “Why me?”She thought death was as natural as life.

# Celebrate her birthday.

May 4 was Audrey’s birthday, and while Elvis fans practically make anational holiday out of Elvis’s birthday, why not remember Audrey inyour own way? Now, we’re not saying make a pilgrimage toTolochenaz, or turn La Paisible into Graceland, but here are a fewthings you can do to let AH know you are thinking of her.

Throw a party.

Make a contribution to UNICEF. It can be just a few dollars, but givewhat you feel comfortable doing.

Have (liquid) breakfast at Tiffany’s. Okay, we totally made this up—asAudrey preferred J&B Scotch (but Holly Golightly loved herchampers). Here is a delicious drink from our favorite mixologist, DaleDeGroff, author of The Craft of the Cocktail.

| Miss Golightly’s Champagne Passion |

1 ounce Cointreau

1 ounce passion fruit puree

4 ounces Champagne

Assemble the Cointreau and the passion fruit puree in a cocktail shakerand shake well with ice. Strain into a Champagne flute. Fill slowly andcarefully with cold Champagne. Garnish with a thin spiral of orangepeel twisted over the top of the drink, then dropped it into the drink.

Buy back her personal letters. Audrey’s letters are occasionally sold byformer “friends” and in-laws. (Relatives, we might add, that she wasvery kind to during their lives.) For major, major bonus points inAudrey World and all-around good Karma, buy them and return themto Sean or Rob.

# Have fun with it all.

Audrey was never afraid to have a little fun at her own expense. ConnieWald tells the story, “I remember once she stopped at Tiffany’s in L.A.,and was going to San Francisco and ordered something and wanted topick it up, and they said to her, ‘Have you any identification?’ And shesmiled at them and said, ‘My face!’ ”

# Some of Audrey’s Nicknames

AH was generally known as Audrey, Mrs. Ferrer, Mrs. Dotti, or, ifshe was on a film set, Miss Hepburn. But among favored friends, shealso had a few nicknames. . . .

Aud—English chumminess favored by Peter O’Toole in How toSteal a Million. A very happy set, on which she called him Gov.

Monkey Puzzle, or MP—the nickname her father gave her as a child.He was the only person to call her this.

Dad—While writing from the Beverly Hills Hotel in 1957, shesigned letters to Fred Zinnemann, her director on The Nun’s Story, thisway. Inexplicable, but true.

# | An Exceedingly Arbitrary Audrey List |

Herewith, an updated list of some things AH would have loved.

Chocolate? Scharffen Berger, Swiss baking chocolate

Bathing suit? Eres

Hotels? Beverly Hills Hotel, Plaza Athénée (New York/Paris), Raphael(Paris), Claridge’s (London)

Shoes? Ferragamo (still), Manolo Blahnik, Keds, Roger Vivier, possiblyBelgian loafers

# THE AUDREY QUESTIONNAIRE

Favorite color? White

Favorite color for evening wear? Black or red. Solid colors, no flowers,prints, or ruffles, except the one time she wore a beautiful Givenchy-designed, pink sari-style evening dress, when she substituted forMother Teresa as a presenter at the 1992 Oscars.

Ice cream? Chocolate

Treat? Baking chocolate

Movie? In later years, Witness, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, E.T., and ThePrincess Bride (she also had the sound track). But in general, Audreydidn’t talk about films, let alone her own.

Favorite poem? According to Gregory Peck, it was “Unending Love,”

by Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore.

Favorite actress? Anything with Michelle Pfeiffer, Meryl Streep, Cher,or Julia Roberts in it

Music? According to Rob, “Audrey liked well-ordered music. She likedBach very much, but found it difficult to have music on unless shecould sit and listen to it. She loved jazz and George Shearing’s music.”

Public figure most admired? Gandhi and the Dalai Lama

Guilty pleasure? She loved American television shows. Living inSwitzerland especially in the early years, they could not get them, butRobert Wolders’s sister lived in Holland, where they got the programs,and they used to send tapes. Audrey said that "L.A. Law was sowonderful because the ensemble acting between the people is so good.Only in America would people have the opportunity to really develop acharacter because they work with the same people day in and out.”Audrey also got a kick out of watching Dynasty.

Favorite authors? Graham Greene, Tom Wolfe, Jeffrey Archer, WillaCather, Lawrence Sanders. In her twenties, she loved RudyardKipling’s work. Although she spoke several languages—English,Dutch, French, Italian, and Spanish—and wrote notes to Hubert inFrench, she read in English for relaxation.

During the UNICEF years, she didn’t have much time to readbecause she was always trying to keep up to date with the UNpublications and the reports from the field.

Politics? Became more involved with politics because of UN work.Robert Wolders believes “she had always been political to a greatextent.”

Favorite artist? El Greco, Mary Cassatt. The bulk of the paintings in herhome were by Bob Kane. Audrey also drew and sketched beautifullyherself.

Two things that would surprise us about Audrey? “She had great legs!”laughs Bob Willoughby. Audrey also loved shopping malls; that wasthe first thing she wanted to do when she visited Rob’s family inRochester. She loved the concept of it, and she liked to buy gifts forfriends that you could not get in Europe. She loved the Gap to buy babyclothes because the Gap did not exist in Europe then.

Personal philosophy? “Childishly optimistic.” Audrey always felt that

everything would be all right at the end.

Ballet flats? Capezio, Repetto, or Delman (black only)

Magazine subscriptions? Foreign Affairs (publication of the Council onForeign Relations), French and British Vogue, Vanity Fair, Cook’sIllustrated, British House and Garden, Town & Country, O magazine

The "a girl’s gotta dream” catalog ? Vivre, Van Cleef & Arpels, L.L. Bean(for doggy canine accoutrements), Williams-Sonoma

Scotch? J&B or Chivas Regal Black Label

Favorite movie (her own)? The Nun’s Story. Audrey was understandablyproud of the work she did on this 1959 film. Even today, Rob can barelywatch it, he finds the acting so close to the real Audrey. (And for the record,Audrey Wilder thinks that Two for the Road is AH’s “most honest” work asan actress.)

Christmas cards? UNICEF

Watch? Didn’t wear one

Pocketbook? Pocketbooks were not the overblown status symbols they aretoday, but AH favored Hermès or, in the 1970s, LV’s Speedy 30, whenwalking with Givenchy in Paris.

They also had an outpost in NYC that Jackie and all of herKennedy in-laws frequented. Formerly on Wilshire Boulevard in BeverlyHills, catty-corner to the Wilshire Hotel. (RIP)



# London |

65 South Audley Street. Located in the heart of Mayfair, AH and her motherlived here (with the baroness working as a landlady) when they moved toLondon after the war. Audrey’s mother was so conscientious that she couldnot accompany Audrey on her first trip to America, to star in Gigi onBroadway, because she had to stay home and take care of things. There is apub downstairs. Have a drink and imagine Hepburn’s early years.

Bond Street. Where Manolo Blahnik spotted AH catching a cab, in the 1980s.“I saw her, and my heart practically stopped, she was so elegant . . . ,” herecalled.

Claridge’s Hotel. AH met director William Wyler here testing for RomanHoliday. “They were looking for an unknown,” she said, “and I was.” BrookStreet, Mayfair; Claridges.co.uk

Brora. We don’t want to say it’s the best cashmere in the world—but it’sright up there.

# | Paris

Andrea’s son Luca says that he “cannot pass a flower shop” without thinkingof his mother. Perhaps you will, too.

Walk along the side of the Seine with Notre Dame to your right—just likeAudrey and Hubert did in the 1970s. Wear your Burberry raincoat and shareconfidences with a friend.

The top of the stairs at the Louvre with the Winged Victory in thebackground. Have your own Audrey/Fred Astaire as Dick Avery channelingRichard Avedon Funny Face moment—“Take the picture! Take thepicture!”—but, please, don’t break your neck.

The Children’s Carousel in the Tuileries. Who knows—maybe you will meetyour own Cary Grant.

Hotel Raphael. Audrey stayed here, so has Natalie Portman—why not you?17 Avenue Kléber;

Louis Vuitton. Rob bought Audrey a hard-sided makeup case here when theyhad just begun dating (he noticed that her old one had worn out, and got it for

her as a gift)—now there’s a beau. 38 Avenue de Champs-Elysees;

Vintage Haute Couture. You can pretend Audrey (or Babe Paley) was yourgrandmother and left you all this gorgeous stuff after you’ve seen this shop.Top of the line. Just like our Audrey. Palais Royale.

Poilane Bakery. Founded in 1932, where Hubert still gets his bread. If youvisit, ask to go downstairs and see the ovens. Fortunately, they deliver viaFedEx to America. 8 rue du Cherche Midi; .

# Rome

Greg Peck’s Place. Don’t think we’re not doing our research—we found theapartment where Audrey’s character hid out with news-paperman GregoryPeck in Roman Holiday. Via Margutta No. 33.

Hassler Hotel. The joint in Rome—favored by producers, movie stars, andscreenwriters on the studio’s dime for decades. Located right on the SpanishSteps, where AH stayed while in Rome. Run by the impeccable (andimplacable) Roberto Wirth. As an American, dress properly, keep your voicedown, and tip freely. Ask for rooms in the front.

If you are looking to save a few dollars (which is all relative, of course, inRome), check out the International Wine Academy of Rome (we kid younot), which is next door and Hassler’s sister hotel.

Excelsior Hotel. Another showstopper. Via Veneto, 125;

Marisa Padovan. AH had her bespoke bathing suits made here (well, she isnot a style icon for nothing). The owner is quoted as saying bikinis cost £400,with a one-piece going for £500. It takes two to three months to have made,but can also be turned around quickly in about a week if you are going onyour honeymoon. Located on a side street close to the Spanish Steps. Villadella Carrozze; .

Caffé Greco. Where James Hanson and Gregory Peck hung out playing ginrummy (Greg waiting for his scene, Jimmy waiting for Audrey) during theshooting of Roman Holiday. Via Condotti, 84.

Hotel de Paris. Audrey was filming Monte Carlo Baby in 1951 when she wasspotted by Colette in the lobby, who said, “Voilà, there is my Gigi!” And astar was born. These days, you have to be a guest of the hotel to enter thelobby, but worth the trip.

# | Switzerland |

The ski lift at Megeve, Switzerland. For sharing bon mots with Cary Grant-esque strangers à la Charade.

La Paisible. We’re not suggesting you take the forty-minute train ride fromGeneva to visit AH’s former 1740-era home (surrounded by a fieldstonewall). We are just saying that if you do, take a left at the train station andwalk about fifteen minutes to the very quiet (albeit pretty) country village . . .where there is absolutely nothing going on. Just the way Audrey liked it.

There used to be a two-room Audrey museum, put together as an homageby her neighbors, which was closed after Sean and Luca took their mother’sthings back (after a five-year loan). “This is my mother’s resting place,”groused Sean, “not Graceland.” Route de Bière, Tolochenaz.

# Ireland |

Shelbourne Hotel. Audrey met her father here in 1964 after a nearly twenty-year absence. 27 St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin.

# MISCELLANEOUS

International Campaign for Tibet (ICT). The Dalai Lama’s lifelong mission.With people like Richard Gere, Kerry Kennedy, and Melissa Mathison, thescreenwriter for E.T., on the board of directors, you know Audrey wouldhave been involved.

The Audrey rose. Spring Hill Nurseries created the Audrey rose in Hepburn’shonor. Now it seems to have been discontinued. Perhaps Audrey Fans canstart a petition to have it reinstated. When Audrey learned that a rose had

been named for her, she said, “Oh, this is the most romantic thing!” Weagree.

# WOULD AUDREY . . .

Have sold her letters? Absolutely not. In 2003, Fidelma Hepburn-Ruston, thethird wife of Audrey’s father, put twenty-six of Audrey’s letters up for salewith Kenneth W. Rendell, a specialist in autographs, historical letters,documents, manuscripts, and rare books, and boy, does this annoy Audrey’ssons and Rob. We think AH would have been appalled.

For the record, Rob has beautiful letters from Audrey that will never seethe light of day. Instead, he intends to leave them to Sean and Luca.

Have sat for an interview with Oprah Winfrey? Possibly. Although neitherJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Princess Grace of Monaco, nor Princess Dianaever made the pilgrimage to Chicago, there is only one reason Audrey mighthave, might have agreed to an interview—to promote the work of UNICEF.

Although AH hated sitting for televised interviews, and half joked aboutthe tough line of questioning Phil Donohue followed when he asked herabout her weight, her age, and plastic surgery during the first minute and ahalf of his interview with her (“and they told me you were so nice,” she halfseriously chided him), she might have made an exception for Miss O.

In addition to Africa, having zero interest in getting married, and their loveof dogs, pasta, and books, they also could have bonded over their shared loveof All Things Valentino.

And we know it would have had the highest ratings of any Oprah show.Ever.

Believe in the talismanic power of clothing? Yes. Audrey was alwaysnervous about speaking in public or giving speeches on behalf of UNICEF.But she confided to Givenchy, “When I talk about UNICEF in front of thetelevision cameras, I am naturally emotional. Wearing your blouses makesme feel protected.”

Stay grounded? Yes. As Rob observes, “In her personal life, there was a lotof pain. We talked about it to some extent because we lived through the samewar, and the same deprivation, and I think when you are exposed to that kindof strife and deprivation, you are grateful for anything good that comes

afterwards, but in Audrey, fame, when it came so early in life, it didn’t go toher head. She remained very realistic. So she knew that every individual hadto suffer adversity, so she never said, ‘Why me?’ ”

Remain cautiously optimistic? Yes. In general, Audrey tended to look at themore positive aspect of a situation. Once, asked if there was a downside tobeing a movie star, she replied, “It was never a burden, and there really isn’t adownside. Like in anything, you can find a problem. I think there was whenmy second son was born, and I was at that time living in Rome, and I couldnot take him anywhere—not to a park, not down the street, not put him on aterrace without paparazzi. That again was very difficult because it wasn’t mebothering the child, but to have photographers jumping out from behind trees,and he’d be howling because he was so startled! But then again, a dear friendwho had a little garden in Rome, told me: ‘Bring your child here, with otherchildren, as often as you want, I’d love to have them in the garden, it wouldmake me happy!’

“So there are the little difficult moments . . . I can think of no downside.”Look dated? No. Fashion historian June Weir noted that “Grace Kelly looksdated, but not Audrey. In terms of fashion and style, she was so far ahead inthe way that she thought of herself. Even at the very end, she looked twentyyears younger.”

From a man’s perspective, Rob thought it was her vivaciousness that madeAudrey so au courant. “They talk about the things that Audrey wore, but Ithink it was the person inside. When she wore her evening clothes, she wasalmost like a child dressing up. Because most of the times she wore jeans anda Lacoste shirt, it was a kick for her. But I really do think it’s the womaninside the clothes. I think it’s one of the reasons people try to look likeAudrey, because they think if they wore those clothes, they would seem tohave the same energy or be the same person.

“Apart from that, she didn’t follow fashion. She continued to wear whatsuited her, and it was nothing uncomfortable or extravagant. Grace Kelly is aclassic beauty, but you almost think of her as a beautiful painting, as twodimensional. But Audrey remains alive.”

Move beyond her fear? Yes. Contrary to how easy she made it look, Rob feltthat “acting didn’t come easy to Audrey at all. She was as nervous with herlast picture, Always, as she was with Roman Holiday.” Sean once commentedthat “she was scared, man, scared.”

Look at the big picture? Yes. Geopolitics and couture aside, Audrey wasabout one thing: peace. Having experienced the brutal ravages of warfirsthand, and through her work with UNICEF, she knew the intolerable costof conflict. She was not naive about the ways of the world, once asking agroup of U.S. senators, “We study war. Why can’t we study and have ascience of peace?”

Let it go? Yes. On the eve of World War II, her father left Audrey and hermother at the mercy of the German army. “Don’t discount anything awfulyou hear or read about the Nazis,” she once said. “It’s worse than you couldever imagine.” Both her husbands cheated on her. Still, she kept her heartopen to the possibility of human kindness and redemption.

Phone it in? Never. Not as an actress. Not for UNICEF, and not for herfriends.

Talk about herself? “As a child,” said Audrey, “I was taught that it was badmanners to bring attention to yourself, and to never, ever make a spectacle ofyourself.” Now if only more non-Tony/Oscar-winning people would followher lead.

Look back? No. “I loathe nostalgia!” said Diana Vreeland, and so didAudrey. Once she left Hollywood, that was it.

Put others first? Yes. Audrey realized that fame and even beauty is short-lived. And according to Rob, “She consciously decided to remain herself. Sothe focus was less on herself than on the boys and on family and her lovedones.” Several weeks before she died, Rob stayed with her in the hospital inNew York City. He slept on a cot in her room and in the morning when hegot up, she noticed he had not slept well, and when he was out showering,she asked one of the nurses if they could bring a foam mattress pad for thecot, so that he would be more comfortable. Years later, thinking of this, Robfound it so touching, because she was in so much pain herself and yet shewas thinking of him, in even the smallest ways.

Be as cool as she seemed? Actually, she was probably cooler. Kevin Aucoinknew that “certain people have a public image, and their private self are twototally different things—miles apart! And she was her public image. And thatwould shock most people, because her pubic persona was so amazing thatyou couldn’t imagine that anyone could actually be like that!”

And we are still picking up pointers from her. As Vera Wang put it: “Theworld came around to her style, she did not ever come around to the world’s

style.”

Be remembered? You tell us.

Among her friends, John Isaac says that “sometimes even now, when I amin some kind of trouble, I think of her.” Bob Willoughby admits that he“prays for her every day.” Jeffrey Banks happened to be in the Ralph Laurenstore on 72nd Street shortly after Audrey died. “Moon River” came over thesound system. Jeffrey was so upset at hearing her voice that he walked out.

Julie Leifermann said, “When she touched your life, it’s something thatyou don’t easily forget. She had that ability with people in her life—to affectyou in ways that were very personal. That’s just the kind of person she was.That had nothing to do with the movie star.

“I think, overall, she was the kind of person that we all would aspire to be.The human being. And, unfortunately, you don’t meet many people like that.And I think that’s the personal gift to us—her ability to grace us with beingherself.”

“Most women of style are courageous.”

—Vera Wang

# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the friends, fans, and fellow biographers of Audrey’swho were so generous with their time and insight. Without theircontributions, there would not be a book. I first became acquainted withAudrey’s world with my first book, AudreyStyle, and it has been a privilegedjourney ever since.

Many people spoke to me out of their friendship and respect for Audrey,and for that I would like to thank Liz Aiello, the late Kevin Aucoin, LetitiaBaldrige, Jeffrey Banks, Jeffrey Bilhuber, Janis Blackschlager, the lateRosemary Clooney, Colin Cowie, Stuart Crowner, Darac, Dale DeGroff,Tiffany Dubin, Dominick Dunne, Tzetzi Ganev, Bobi Garland, Garren,Hubert de Givenchy, James de Givenchy, William A. Henry III, MellodyHobson, John Isaac, Richard Johnson, James Katz, David Kirsch, MichaelKors, Ralph Lauren, Kevin Mazur, Steven Meisel, Polly Mellon, BethMendelson, Ellen Mirojnick, Joseph Montebello, Cathy O’Brien, the lateGregory Peck, Candy Pratts Price, Doris Raymond, Amanda Ross, Jane Ross,Cynthia Rowley, Liz Santelli, Cameron Silver, Dr. Devendra Singh, AndySpade, Steven Spielberg, Christy Turlington, Connie Wald, Vera Wang, JuneWeir, Audrey Wilder, Bob Willoughby, Robert Wolders, Jason Wu.

Audrey Hepburn is one of the most well documented women of our time. Iwould like to recognize the journalists and biographers who came before me—Cecil Beaton, Marie Brenner, Professor Richard Brown, DavidChierichetti, Amy Fine Collins, Stanley Donen, Dominick Dunne, MarcEliot, Charles Higham, Hedda Hopper, Larry King, Barry Paris, J. D.Podolsky, Stephen M. Silverman, Annette Tapert, Dana Thomas, Gore Vidal,Alexander Walker, Barbara Walters, and Ian Woodward.

One of my favorite parts of writing is the research. In addition to all of thepeople that I interviewed, I would also like to thank Faye Thompson, whooversees the stunning AMPAS library in Los Angeles—which is inspiringenough to make anyone want to work in the movie business—and BarbaraHall, who was such a great help to me as I researched AH, Cecil Beaton,Hedda Hopper, and the directors she worked with.

Any serious style biographer must also recognize the Aladdin’s Cave thatis the Condé Nast library—I would practically move in there if I could. It is a

veritable treasure trove of all things Vogue. Cynthia Cathcart, again, was oftremendous assistance.

My Los Angeles research assistant, Lorrie Ivas, is a great friend and a veryinsightful commentator on popular style. I would also like to recognize JustinLuft, the Computer Guy who keeps my life running—no small thing to awriter these days.

Linda Chester is not only my agent, she is also a friend, advisor, andinspiration who has made many of my dreams come true. I feel extremelygrateful to have her in my life. Gary Jaffe of the Linda Chester Agency is alsoa tremendous ally, and one of the funniest men I know.

Without a publishing house, a writer is just someone sitting aroundStarbucks with a laptop and a dream. Working with Gotham Books has beena joy. In addition to publisher William Shinker, I would like to thank myeditor, Lauren Marino, and her more than able assistant editor, BrianneRamagosa, for making WWAD? such a positive experience. I look forward tofurther collaborations. Illustrator Monika Roe brought our Audrey-inspiredsketches beautifully to life. Paula Reedy gave the manuscript a close reading,while Sabrina Bowers was an exceptional design manager. And managingeditor Susan Schwartz and associate production editor Katie Cicatelli madesure this book actually made it to the printer on time.

Finally, I know that I am extremely fortunate to have met so many ofAudrey’s friends and fans over the past decade. I would like to dedicate thisbook to her fans around the world who keep her memory, and her goodworks, alive. Thank you.

# About the Author

Pamela Keogh is the author of Audrey Style, Jackie Style, and Elvis Presley:The Man. The Life. The Legend. Her work has been featured on the Todayshow, Larry King Live, Vanity Fair, The New York Times, Town & Country,InStyle, People magazine, Harper’s Bazaar, Entertainment Tonight, the LosAngeles Times, the BBC, and hundreds of other media outlets around theworld.

A graduate of Vassar College, she lives in New York City. Her Web site is

1

New research from a recently discovered nine-page (single-spaced)transcribed interview between AH and HH. Never before seen, this veryrevealing conversation took place between Hepburn and Hopper onSeptember 11, 1953, at Hopper’s office in Hollywood, California.

2

For the record, Julia Roberts is one of the few modern stars Tzetzi has highmarks for.

3

For Audrey, we mean.

4

Instead, her singing would be dubbed by Marni Nixon, although AH canbe heard in the restored 1994 MFL print.

5

When AH signed her first Paramount contract for Roman Holiday, thestudio asked her to change her surname. She politely refused.

6

One of Audrey’s best friends.

7

His mother promptly had him removed from the SR once she learned of hisnew career.

8

And currently married when they met.

9

AH and Hanson always spoke positively of each other. In 1959, he marriedGeraldine Kaelin and had three children. JH went on to found a powerfulindustrial conglomerate worth $\$ 17$ billion with interests ranging from tobaccoto chemicals. In 1983, he was named a baron and admitted to the House ofLords. Years later, he and his wife ran into AH and Rob at an event, and AHsaid, “Well, now, we haven’t done too badly for ourselves, have we?”Hanson died in 2004 at the age of eighty-two.

10

Unless you want to, of course.

11

Translation: He does not want to marry you.

12

Or worse—as director Alfred Lunt and the critics noted—the male leadcan’t act.

13

To further confuse matters—no relation to Mel.

14

For the record, Dr. Singh’s favorite Audrey movie is Charade. “And whatwas that one, with Peter O’Toole, where they try to steal the artwork? [Howto Steal a Million] She was so charming in that.”

15

Funny Face (1957), Charade (1963), Two for the Road (1967).

16

Despite AH’s fears that they might be a bother, they both ended up stayingat Cukor’s.

17

Like most of Audrey’s friends, the baroness was similarly unenthusedabout AH’s marriage to Andrea Dotti, brightening only when Rob appearedon the scene. The fact that he spoke fluent Dutch, no doubt, helped thesituation.

18

She also trimmed the edges of the stamp with a tiny pair of gold scissors.Now you know why Truman Capote said of Mrs. Paley, “She was perfect. . ..”

19

Besides, she hated Danishes, and for the opening scene of Breakfast atTiffany’s she wanted to eat an ice-cream cone instead, but director BlakeEdwards refused.

20

Take our word for it: Audrey sketched beautifully, and wrote poetry inletters to friends.

21

For example, American Airlines’ Admirals Club.

22

Like Marilyn Monroe, Nancy Reagan, JFK, and Elton John, we are partialto T. Anthony.

23

And for the record, Audrey did none of these things (well, except for the

sacks of rice during a UNICEF tour). We are just illustrating a point.

24

The one everyone’s mom, or grandmother, instantly went out and bought.

25

We are not letting our own subset off the hook here, either. Many, manywriters (F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Edna St. Vincent Millay,Hunter S. Thompson) smoked, too.

26

And that bonehead Ben Gazzara.

27

More BAT insider info—Steve McQueen was offered the lead male role,but turned it down and it eventually went to George Peppard. Audrey andBullitt? Now there would have been a pairing.

28

For Henry Mancini’s title track alone.
