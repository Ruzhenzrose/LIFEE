“She seemed so terribly different and sort of very angelic and sort of veryethereal. It was like some kind of fairy book person.”

—Harry Belafonte

WHEN AUDREY HEPBURN DIED AT 8 P.M. on January 20, 1993, at the age of sixty-three, she left behind one Academy Award, two Tony Awards, dozens of life-time achievement awards, her beloved sons Sean and Luca, companionRobert Wolders, millions of fans, universal acclaim as an indefatigable activ-ist on behalf of the world’s children, and one final surprise—a nearly emptycloset.

This most stylish of actresses, muse for designer Hubert de Givenchy, per-ennial fixture on the Best-Dressed List, and idol of millions for her sense ofstyle, had stored her endlessly discussed, dissected, and scrutinized clothingin the bedroom of her beloved “La Paisible” home in Tolochenaz, Switzer-land. Ten double-paneled hand-painted doors in the light airy room held thepromise of hidden couture treasures, perhaps original Givenchys or RalphLaurens, and yet when the doors were opened, the closet was, in the words ofAudrey’s older son, Sean Ferrer, “not more than $2 0 \%$ full—with blue jeans,wool slacks, blazers, and t-shirts.”

Where were the designer originals worth tens of thousands of dollars? Thedazzling Cecil Beaton My Fair Lady gowns or the world-famous GivenchyLittle Black Dress from Breakfast at Tiffany’s? Why did Audrey Hepburn, ofall people, have a nearly empty closet with nary a couture gown in sight? Theanswer proved both simple and profound, touching as it did upon every as-pect of her life’s journey, because during her last ten years, Audrey Hepburnkept ruthlessly paring away at her life until only the absolute essentials re-

mained. Hollywood? Not interested. Fashion shows? Thank you, but no.There was simply no need for Givenchy gowns when trekking acrossdrought-stricken portions of Africa on behalf of UNICEF and the starvingchildren of the world.

She had walked away from the church of fame that rules Hollywood andever-increasing swaths of the general public yet held onto that fame withouteven trying. Her elusiveness only increased public interest in her films andclothes as well as her life and loves, but Audrey Hepburn had grown uninter-ested in rehashing old tales of Hollywood glamour and legendary friends. Inan industry which based its self-image on endless awards shows, she was, itwas safe to say, the only screen idol about whom a son could convincinglystate: “Being away from home to win an award was really a lost opportunity.Walking the dogs with her sons was a personal victory.”

This turning away from surface fripperies occurred hand in hand withAudrey’s inversion of the usual Hollywood worldview: far from dreading theyears after age fifty, she had instead embraced them. With her sons grownand her priorities reordered, the freedom found in serving others had nowgranted her a belief in her own worth that she had sought, sometimes desper-ately, throughout her entire life.

In truth, if anyone had been paying strict attention to the substance be-neath her oft-dazzling surface, they would have seen an indication of her ulti-mate direction as far back as 1959’s The Nun’s Story; speaking to her cast-mate Patricia Bosworth, she had, in an atypical piece of soul-bearing, ex-plained: “I love fashion, you know. Really love it. But fashion has nothing todo with me.” At which point, recalled Bosworth, Audrey touched her heartand emphasized: “The me in here . . . the private me, the interior me—insideI’m not fashionable at all.”

As her acting abilities actually deepened—witness her moving cameo inher final film, Steven Spielberg’s Always—she had, like all great artists,stripped away the extraneous and clever in search of the truth, seeking an-swers at last to the ultimate questions: Who am I, and where do I fit in? Howcan I make a difference? And with that personal expansion echoed in an evol-ution from couture clotheshorse to casual style icon to khaki-clad activist,only one constant remained: the vulnerability underneath the beautifully con-trolled and genuinely kind exterior.

Which brings us back to the bedroom closets: neatly painted, perfectly

ordered, and nearly empty. Because by turning her back on the glamour—onthe clothes, the awards, and the self-interest—by not just talking about givingback to others but actually doing so on an international scale unfathomable toothers, Audrey Hepburn had actually deepened the bond with her fans of fiftyyears. How, they wondered, could anyone be filled with such loving kind-ness? Such unselfishness?

And while Audrey remained grateful for those who loved her films, aftergracefully accepting compliments for her acting, she would politely butfirmly switch the topic to her real, not reel, work: helping to save childrenthrough UNICEF. By now St. Audrey had become the focus of so much cul-tural heft placed upon her reed-thin frame that she had surpassed the bound-aries imposed upon the very notion of stardom, becoming not just an inspira-tional figure but an aspirational one as well. A woman who made people feelbetter about themselves. A secular saint to many, she grew genuinely embar-rassed by the attention heaped upon her and determinedly tried to focus thatattention on others she felt had achieved so much more on behalf of children.

She had reinvented the entire third act of her life, not out of a wish forpublicity or image polishing but, instead, out of a need to help others whichhad arisen from the most personal of experiences; having been saved fromstarvation at the end of World War II by the United Nations Relief and Re-habilitation Agency (UNRRA), Audrey could now, at last, pay it forward.And, in the process, fully come to terms with a Dutch childhood nearly suf-focated by the Nazi occupiers of her homeland.

Because long before the dazzling turns in Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Break-fast at Tiffany’s, and My Fair Lady, and decades before the awards and uni-versal acclaim as a beautiful and charming trendsetter, there had been a child-hood in which there had not been the slightest talk of acting and Hollywoodstardom, a time when mere survival remained the only goal.

Audrey Kathleen van Heemstra Ruston. A face made for the camera. Photofest


“Her life really is like a fairy tale because fairy tales are not just aboutgood stuff. There are terrible things that happen on the way.”

—Sean Hepburn Ferrer

ALTHOUGH AUDREY WAS TO DETERMINEDLY eschew all trappings of nobility, hermother Ella, born the third daughter of Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, con-ducted her own life with a pronounced sense of aristocratic entitlement. In-deed, her marriage in 1920 to the Honourable Jon Hendrik Gustaaf AdolfQuarles van Ufford, Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau, seemed sociallyfitting, began promisingly, and produced two sons, Ian and Alexander. Butdiffering outlooks and two substantial egos ended the marriage after only fiveyears, and Ella soon found the man with whom she felt destined to spend therest of her married life, Joseph Ruston.

With his appropriately tweedy and aristocratic façade, the handsome andeleven-years-older Ruston seemed both well-heeled and well-connected. IfElla’s own attractive features carried more than a hint of hauteur, for Rustonthere was always the benefit of her title—Baroness Ella van Heemstra—toconsider. A glider pilot and accomplished horseman, Ruston was smart—inthe words of Ella and Joseph’s grandson Sean, “He was a true dilettante and abrilliant one at that”—and he quickly divorced his wife to marry Ella.

After marrying on September 7, 1926, the couple soon settled in Brussels,where in the suburb of Ixelles, at 3 a.m. on May 24, 1929, they welcomeddaughter Audrey—known to the family as Adrianntje. Almost immediately acrisis arose: at the age of three weeks Audrey caught whooping cough, andElla, relying solely upon her Christian Science faith, did not take her to thedoctor. When the crisis deepened and Audrey stopped breathing, Ella revived

her infant daughter by spanking her back into life. In the view of Sean, thepsychological effects of the incident upon his mother proved lifelong: “Shesaw life itself as a gift and saw her own survival as precious and a matter ofchance.”

Crisis averted, Ella and Joseph’s infant daughter was now formallychristened Audrey Kathleen van Heemstra Ruston. With a British father (Ire-land was not yet an independent country when Joseph was born) and Dutchmother, infant Audrey, for purposes of citizenship, was deemed British. Hermixed heritage of Dutch, English, and Irish proved to be a big reason whyAudrey never thought of herself as coming from any one country, laughinglystating in later years: “I’m half-Irish, half-Dutch and I was born in Belgium.If I was a dog, I’d be a hell of a mess.”

As to the Hepburn name: by now, Joseph, who was descended from theengineer John Joseph Ruston, had concluded that he had Hepburn ancestorsthrough his grandmother Isabella Hepburn and decided to add the Hepburnsurname to Ruston. However, it had been John Joseph Ruston’s second wife,Barbara Victoria Belha, who gave birth to his four children, his first wife Isa-bella Hepburn Ruston having died in 1857 without bearing any children. Theprovenance of the Hepburn surname may therefore remain questionable, but,said Audrey’s cousin Walter Ruston, a family archivist: “I am convinced that,to her dying day, [Audrey] believed she was a Hepburn.”

On the surface, all seemed fine in the Ruston household at the CastelSainte-Cecile estate in the village of Linkebeek. Nanny Greta was on hand tohelp raise Audrey, and in the aftermath of the First World War, the Victorianera was quickly becoming a dusty relic. The 1920s had indeed begun to roar,with a burgeoning sense of personal freedom running right alongside a newconsumer society stocked with automobiles, household appliances, and ra-dios. Stocks soared ever higher and talking movies startled the world.

And yet.

Cracks soon began to appear in the façade. Three days after Audrey’sbirth, eight were killed in Berlin as Communists clashed with police, and theNational Socialist Party continued to gain ground. A mere four years later,Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, an ascendency which broughtabout a chapter in the Hepburn family history that was to haunt Audreythroughout her life: her parents’ infatuation with fascism.

It was Joseph who first became enamored of the fascist movement in Eng-

land, and after his boss, Montagu Norman, introduced him to friends like thenotorious Hitler worshiper Unity Mitford, Joseph joined the circle surround-ing the leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), Oswald Mosley. In theprocess, he inculcated a fervent support of the fascists in Ella.

Ella proceeded to publish several articles in Blackshirt, the BUF period-ical, under the byline “Baroness Ella de Heemstra.” The most notorious andunfortunate example of her writings ran on April 26, 1935, under the title“The Call of Fascism,” in which she boldly extolled “those who have heardthe call of Fascism, and have followed the light on the upward road to vic-tory. . . .” More disturbing words were to come: “The Germany of today is amost present country, and the Germans, under Nazi rule, a splendid exampleto the white races of the world.”

By now, Ella’s fascination with Hitler extended well beyond the printedword, and she attended the Nazi Party conference in Nuremberg. It was,while it existed, a full-blown admiration for the fascist leader, and while shelater renounced the Nazis, her undeniable early infatuation with Hitler and hisassociates was to prove anathema to Audrey, who loathed every aspect of thefascist movement.

Even a shared attraction to the fascists, however, could not paper over theincreasing fissures in the Ruston marriage. Joseph, a self-proclaimed “finan-cial broker,” came to rely increasingly upon the van Heemstra money, and asthe money vanished at an ever more rapid rate, quarrels between Joseph andElla broke out frequently. Young Audrey took refuge in the one way thatmade sense to her six-year-old self: by hiding underneath the dining roomtable.

The Ruston marriage began to crumble amidst rumors of James’s affairwith a nanny, and ended for good when he walked out in 1935. Many as-sumed that the occasionally remote, aristocratic Ella suffered the separationand ultimate divorce in silence, but the opposite proved true. Stated Audreyin later years: “She cried day in, day out. I thought that she never wouldstop.” Only six years old at the time, Audrey nonetheless took on a very adultrole: “My mother would sob through the night. And I would just try and bewith her.”

For young Audrey, Joseph’s abrupt departure proved devastating. Cer-tainly, he was a remote father, but as his grandson Sean points out, heprovided fun for young Audrey: “He was joyous—maybe not a warm father,

not a joking father, but he spoke thirteen languages and as a gliding pilot hewould take my mother gliding. When he left so abruptly it was almost as if hewere going out for cigarettes and never came back.”

The loss of her father gave birth to an emotional trauma which remainedwith Audrey for the rest of her life, and as late as 1989, the then-sixty-year-old Audrey bluntly termed Joseph’s leaving “the most traumatic event in mylife. . . . I was terrified. What was going to happen to me?” That upheavalproved the single most important reason why, when her own marriages toMel Ferrer, father of Sean, and Andrea Dotti, father of Luca, ended, she in-sisted that both sons stay in close contact with their fathers: “[Children need]two parents for the equilibrium in life. I mean emotional equilibrium.”

Joseph’s move back to England, where he grew increasingly vocal abouthis fascist sympathies, marked the beginning of Audrey’s peripatetic child-hood, with Ella moving Audrey and her two brothers (Audrey was always tocall them her brothers, no “half” about it) from their base in Brussels to Hol-land. Audrey also began living part of the year in England, starting school in1935 at Miss Ridgen’s in Elham, Kent, and when the divorce settlementbetween Joseph and Ella was finalized in 1938, part of the settlement decreedthat Audrey was to continue her schooling in England. This portion of the de-cree was ostensibly included so that Audrey could reside part of every yearnear her father, but Joseph rarely came to visit his daughter.

Having been raised in Belgium and Holland, Audrey did not speak fluentEnglish when she arrived in Elham, and when combined with the fact that shewas, surprisingly enough, somewhat plump at that age, she experienced boutsof true loneliness. And yet, with her determination to rise above all obstacles,she later mused that it “turned out to be a good lesson in independence.”

She soldiered on with her joyless school lessons, taking refuge in her ownimagination and love of drawing: “I liked the children and my teachers but Inever liked the process of learning. I was very restless and could never sitstill for hours on end. . . . School in itself I found very dull, and I was happywhen I was finished.”

There was, however, one consolation which proved to be life altering: theintroduction of dance into her life. A young dancer from London began trav-eling to Elham to teach ballet classes, and eight-year-old Audrey became ut-terly enthralled with dancing: both the artistic impulse that released her fromher interior life and the disciplined, all-consuming dedication to her art dove-

tailed with Audrey’s personality. Recalling those early dance lessons, she en-thused: “I loved it, just loved it.” In a revealing comment made over fiftyyears later, she explained: “I don’t deal with words very well. I love music—dancing—it takes you out of yourself.”

She found another life-altering experience in being sent every summer “tostay with a family (in England) whom I absolutely adored.” Living with thecoal-mining Butcher family in the summer months not only immersedAudrey in the English language but also provided her with a loving secondfamily; in later years she was to keep a photo of the family’s dog on her van-ity. Such was her bond with the Butchers that after gaining international fameas an Academy Award–winning movie star, she pursued a renewed connec-tion with the family, and through her contacts at the United Nations joyfullyaided one of the family members in adopting a baby.

Her ballet lessons and happy summers disappeared, however, when warbroke out between Britain and Germany in September of 1939. Erroneouslythinking that the Netherlands, unlike Britain, would never be invaded by theGermans, Ella decided that Audrey would be safer away from England, andon December 14, 1939, a DC-3 made the cross-channel flight with ten-year-old Audrey on board. It was, recalled Audrey, “really one of the last planesout.”

Ella then moved her daughter and two sons to the van Heemstra home,Villa Beukenhof, in the village of Velp, where they began living with Ella’ssister and father. Velp lay just outside the town of Arnhem, possessed the railservice deemed important to the Germans, and was situated only forty milesfrom the German border, yet in Ella’s reasoning it would still prove safe be-cause it was a good distance away from the front. Unfortunately, on May 17,1940, the Germans crossed into Holland, marched directly into Arnhem, andinstantly took complete control of the town. Said the adult Audrey: “Thereare so many images that will never go away. Tanks coming in for hours. Hol-land fell in 5 days.” Still processing the loss of her father, Audrey was nowalso struggling to grasp the reality of the German invasion: “The secondworst memory I have after my father’s disappearance was my mother cominginto my bedroom one morning, pulling back the curtains and saying, ‘Wakeup, the war’s on.’” In later years, Audrey was to tell Sean: “From one day tothe next everything you took for granted was gone. Eventually there was nofood, no heat.” And looming over it all, a complete and utter lack of freedom.

Noble antecedents meant nothing to the Nazis, and the remnants of the vanHeemstra wealth—jewelry, stocks, and cash—all vanished. Audrey’s brotherIan was sent to a labor camp in Germany while Alexander went into hidingand joined the resistance. Audrey’s childhood innocence was over, and theknowledge of the horrors men were capable of inflicting upon one anotherwas to haunt the shy youngster for the rest of her life.

Audrey, now age ten, was understandably confused about her nationality,and at the time she began school in the Netherlands felt “more English thanDutch.” Enrolled in a Dutch public school, her English accent and rudiment-ary Dutch instantly marked her as an outsider: “Every time I opened mymouth, everyone was roaring with laughter.” Concerned that the nameAudrey sounded too British in occupied Holland, Ella changed two letters inher own name and for the duration of the occupation Audrey was henceforthknown as Edda. (Curiously, she was still billed as Audrey Hepburn-Ruston inall programs for her Dansschool performances.)

Juggling different names and multiple countries meant that Audrey’s de-sire and psychological need for a permanent home—a place of refuge, com-fort and love—now took hold. As an adult, she explained it in the most basicof terms: “Maybe that’s why I’m so attached to my own family. They are myroots.”

Only eleven when she first glimpsed the horrors of the Nazi war machine,Audrey was unquestionably scarred for life by the atrocities she witnessed: “Isaw families with little children, with babies, herded into meat wagons—trains of big wooden vans with just a little slat open at the top and all thosefaces peering out at you. . . . There would be families together and theywould separate them, saying ‘The men go there and the women go there.’Then they would take the babies . . .”

Joseph’s disappearance had drawn Audrey and her mother closer, but itwas closeness with a caveat: Ella was not demonstrative and rarely praisedany of Audrey’s efforts. Born June 12, 1900, and at her core a very Victorianaristocrat, Ella held the aristocratic view that it was unseemly in the extremeto make a spectacle of oneself. Said Robbie Wolders, Audrey’s companionfor the final thirteen years of her life: “Ella was a superior woman, very hu-morous… but critical of everyone, including Audrey. Biased. Intolerant.”Deserted by her husband, and trying to raise a ten-year-old daughter underthe shadow of the Nazis, Ella, out of necessity, developed a somewhat forbid-

ding exterior. Wrote Luca of the war years: “Ella was her father figure andMeisje [her aunt] was her mother . . . Meisje was the one teaching her how todraw. It was really Meisje who made the magic come alive. Ella was aboutrules.”

At the same time, however, it was Ella who recognized her daughter’s at-traction to the arts, and she encouraged Audrey’s growing interest by takingher to concerts and to the ballet. The shy and impressionable youngster fellhead over heels in love with the make believe, happily-ever-after world of thearts, where life was not only beautiful, but controllable. Design, lighting, ac-tion—it could all be practiced and perfected, with no room for unpleasantsurprises like a beloved parent walking out.

It wasn’t just thoughts of Audrey’s welfare which motivated Ella, how-ever, because underneath her very proper Victorian façade, Ella was, in factmore than a bit of a classic stage mother—a frustrated performer who livedout her dreams through her daughter. Said Audrey: “My mother desperatelywanted to become an actress. Yet my grandfather strictly forbade her to gonear the stage . . . I don’t think my mother ever got over her disappointmentin obeying him.” In Ella’s own words: “I tried to obey my father. But I grewup wanting more than anything else to be . . . well, English, slim, and an act-ress.” Which makes it all the more interesting that in those last three wordslies an exact description of Audrey. Said Luca: “Ella was the frustrated primadonna, born a century too soon.” In the even more discerning assessment ofAudrey herself: “My mother would have been better off in Vienna, or any-where in Italy or France—anywhere where music and art were of equal im-portance to food and drink.”

Ella, it turned out, was not going to let Audrey make the same mistake. IfAudrey wanted to dance, then dance she would.

# Chapter Three

# WAR AND A LIFE OF DANCE, 1940–1947

“With her vivid style and incomparable elegance, Audrey Hepburn truly isthe patron style saint of ballerinas.”

—“Dance, Expression and Audrey Hepburn”

URGED ON BY ELLA, AT the age of eleven and a half, Audrey began studying bal-let seriously at the Arnhemsche Muziekschool (Arnhem Music School) withDutch ballerina Winja Marova. Her classes represented the beginning of a lifeof extraordinary self-discipline; whether expressed through hours at the barre,rehearsal on a film set, or in strict adherence to a notoriously spare diet,Audrey Hepburn’s will soon came to play a very large role in her meteoricrise to fame. Explains Sean: “That discipline absolutely grew out of her train-ing as a dancer. It’s in the back, the posture, the arch, the frame. It’s . . . howyou move, how you step into a Givenchy dress and walk in it, but it’s alsoyour mind. Without that, it doesn’t work.”

Surrounded at home by people often two or three times her age, she wasgrowing up fast. Explained Audrey in later years: “I was sixteen when thewar finished, but I had been grown-up from the time I was twelve.” In part asa survival mechanism—a way to take flight away from the horrors of theNazis—and in part because she so loved music and dance, Audrey began im-mersing herself to an even greater degree in the fantasy world of the arts: “Iwas studying and dreaming of Pavlova and Diaghilev. To all intents and pur-poses, I had been cut off from the world of youngsters my age because thewar had made me a prisoner not just physically but mentally, never allowingme to peep out to see what was really outside.” Left to her own devices, shegravitated to music as a soundtrack to accompany her daydreams, and whencombined with an introverted nature exemplified by a love of reading, draw-

ing, and solitary walks, it all began to inform her very approach to life.

The relentless self-discipline of ballet may have felt natural to youngAudrey, but the unending necessity of having to stare into the mirrors liningthe rehearsal hall likely provided the first real step in her lifelong dissatisfac-tion with her own appearance. “I didn’t think much of my looks. In fact, Ithought I was such an ugly thing that no one would ever want me for a wife.”Consistently lauded during her Hollywood years as a singular beauty, Audreynever fully surmounted a self-imposed focus on what she saw as her ownphysical imperfections: crooked teeth, wide jawline, flat chest, and big feetseemed to be all Audrey glimpsed in the mirror as she danced for hours. (Intruth her feet were a size $8 \%$ and certainly not huge.)

With all of life now up for grabs under the Nazi occupation, balletprovided a bedrock of certainty. Here, in this one area, the ground stoppedshifting beneath her feet. Music, the barre, the mirror—all was in order, prov-ing that beauty was still possible in a chaotic world. With its emphasis uponsilhouette, ballet allowed Audrey to develop a preternatural grace, a floating,gliding walk which made it appear as if her feet never really touched theground. Audrey may have noticed only her supposed defects, but that graceproved immediately apparent to all others, with Edouard Scheidius, a friendof Winja Marova, dubbing her “‘Poezepas’—Dutch for cat-walk.”

As she grew older, her much sought after, never to be successfully imit-ated walk evolved into a forward-gliding movement combining a fashionmodel’s skimming-the-surface gait with the grace of a ballet dancer. Hours atthe barre had resulted in a ramrod straight posture, the stuff of a designer’sdreams. The end result was a walk that made clothes fall more softly, theirclean lines displayed to best advantage by her ease of movement.

That walk was to remain with her for the rest of her life, and television in-terviewer Mo Rocca recalled his reaction when she visited Macy’s, where hewas then working: “I was twenty-three years old, behind the fragrancecounter, in April 1992, and she walked by my counter. This is one of thebiggest department stores in the world—and the entire floor fell silent. Evenif cell phones had existed then you never would have taken your cell phoneand shoved it in front of her face for a selfie. She floated by and people knew,this is Audrey Hepburn.”

As a teenager, however, Audrey saw none of this, and grew self-consciousabout her height. As the tallest girl in her ballet class, she had to undertake

the male roles, lifting the little girls who were much shorter than she. How,she wondered, could she ever be a prima ballerina if she were taller thaneveryone else?

Although twelve-year-old Audrey had, in 1941, performed in ballet recit-als in front of German officers at Arnhem’s Wehrmachtheim, by age fifteenshe had stopped dancing in any official or public capacity because she wouldhave had to register as a member of the Dans Kultuurkamer, an artistic unionthat was part of the Reich. Instead of registering with the Dans Kultuurkamer,Audrey had begun helping Dr. Willem Visser ‘t Hooft, the unofficial head ofthe local resistance, whose daughter Annemarth was a dance pupil ofAudrey’s. The work was to prove dangerous, with fourteen-year-old Audreyat one point tapped to carry a Resistance message to an English parachutisthiding in the hills near Arnhem. After delivering the message, Audrey turnedback toward home, only to be stopped by a German soldier. Having justpicked flowers to fit her cover story of spending the day in the countryside,she smiled and gave the young German her bouquet of flowers. The soldierwas charmed by the gesture, and Audrey, having succeeded in a first impro-visation, smiled at the soldier and continued on her way home.

By 1944, she was actively helping the resistance as often as possible,telling an interviewer in 1951 that she had been “running around with foodfor the pilots” who had been shot down. She began delivering the resistancenewspaper, Oranjekrant, which she described as half the size of a paper nap-kin; stuffing the newspapers in the woolen socks she wore with her woodenshoes, she biked around town to deliver the newspapers, an innocuous Dutchgirl who thwarted the Germans under their very noses.

By now Ella had renounced her support of British fascism, her flirtationwith the Nazis likely changed forever when the Germans shot Otto vanLimburg Stirum, husband of her sister Miesje. Ella was certainly well awareof Audrey’s role in helping Allied soldiers, but in typical fashion, Audrey al-ways downplayed her own efforts. As late as 1988, she was to state in a tele-vision interview: “Stories about my contributions to the underground havebeen exaggerated. I took around messages a couple of times—but I was reallytoo young.” 

Much worse was to come, however, when for the first time war waswaged on the streets of Arnhem. So large was the scale of these operationsthat in the end, the Battle of Arnhem, which raged from September 17 to 26,

1944, proved to be the biggest air-land operation of World War II, resultingin more casualties than there had been on D-Day.

The exhausted and greatly undernourished Ella and Audrey now walked toVelp, where Audrey’s grandfather was living at Castle Zijpendaal. Eventu-ally, said Audrey, “we had thirty-seven people sleeping in our house asevacuees continued to arrive.” The details of that unrelentingly harsh timenever left Audrey: “We went for days at a time without anything to eat, andwe sat and shivered in a house without heat or light. . . . We lived in a va-cuum—no life, no news, no books, no soap.”

As the war entered its sixth year, life in the Netherlands reached its nadir.In Audrey’s own words: “Holland was one of the worst because it was occu-pied by the SS—not just the military.” Faced with a shortage of soldiers andsupport personnel, the Germans took to literally grabbing women off thestreet to work in their military kitchens, and in March 1945, Audrey was“picked right off the street with a dozen others” by the notorious Dutch GreenPolice. She was now facing months of servitude, but when the truck stoppedto force more women inside, Audrey jumped out of the truck and ran away:underneath that frail and shy exterior already lay the guts and determinationthat would serve her well in negotiating the perils of Hollywood. After thisnear escape, however, she did not, as legend has it, live by herself in the cel-lar of a bombed-out building for a month, but instead ran home and “stayedindoors for a month.”

By now, Audrey was incapable of dancing because of malnutrition. Re-duced to eating nettles, she developed both jaundice and anemia, and as a res-ult, her resistance and strength were severely weakened. In that final winterof the war, 1944–1945, known as the “hunger winter,” she, and tens of thou-sands of others, were living in a state of near starvation. The crushing realityof the time never left Audrey, and even near the end of her own life, shegrimly recalled: “It was not on the scale of Somalia, but it was pretty bad too,you know. Children were always rummaging in the dust bins and people weredying of hunger and cold.” In the end, the winter claimed nearly twenty-twothousand Dutch lives.

Shops were closed, electricity and heat nonexistent, and the Dutch wereallowed to heat only one room in a house. Soap virtually disappeared, and thewater supply was now unsafe. Fuel for cars and trucks was diverted to theGerman war machine, and all food confiscated by the Germans. Audrey was

subsisting on turnips, bread made from peas and grass, and flour from tulipbulbs; her one meal per day featured a soup made from herbs and water.From the vantage point of later decades Audrey explained: “In those days Iused to say to myself ‘If only this comes to an end, I will never grumbleabout anything again.’”

With the war clearly lost, the Germans finally retreated, and as British andCanadian troops marched into Arnhem, Audrey “ran out to welcome the sol-diers, I inhaled their petrol fumes as if it were a priceless perfume and I de-manded a cigarette, even though it made me choke.” A lifelong addiction toBritish cigarettes was born, right alongside an association of freedom withthe smell of petrol and cigarettes. At age sixteen, she now held an unshake-able appreciation for freedom and liberty, remarking in later years: “That’swhy I say freedom has no price.”

The British troops had marched into Arnhem on Audrey’s sixteenth birth-day, May 4, 1945, with the end of the war in Europe coming four days later.The cessation of hostilities was followed by an event which would foreverchange the course of Audrey’s life: the arrival of the United Nations Reliefand Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), a forerunner of the United Na-tions International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). Alongside theRed Cross, UNRRA brought desperately needed food, medication, and cloth-ing. The clothes, in fact, marked the beginning of Audrey’s love affair withfashion, born as it was in the school classroom set up as the village clothingdistribution center. Choosing from the donated clothes seemed like coutureshopping to Audrey, who had been reduced to wearing her brother’s shoesand skirts made of old curtains. For the rest of her life, she remembered theexact clothes she had picked out: “a white blouse with a Peter Pan collar anda navy-blue pleated skirt. There was a Saks Fifth Avenue label in the blouse.Hence my love ever since of fine clothes.”

At war’s end, Audrey stood five feet, seven inches tall, weighed a skeletalninety pounds, and suffered from anemia, asthma, and jaundice. ExplainedLuca: “One thing my mother always talked about was that when the war wasover, she was diagnosed as being two weeks away from death herself becauseof her malnutrition.” Eventually, she gained twenty pounds, but throughouther adult life, her weight never rose above 110 pounds.

She had survived the war, a wise-beyond-her-years teenager who alreadyunderstood at the core of her psyche exactly what mattered most in a success-

ful life: “I came out of the war thankful to be alive, aware that human rela-tionships matter more than wealth or career or even food. I matured quicklybecause, at a young age, I was made very aware of suffering and terror.” Shealso now possessed a bone-deep belief that she could survive any ordeal, thather own intelligence and common sense would allow her to deal withwhatever life threw her way. If Hitler’s war machine could not kill or defeather, nothing would. In her own pragmatic, tough worldview: “I think whenyou have problems and so forth, you can sense a loneliness because it is youthat has to get it done or make a decision. We all have an innate lonelinessbecause finally when the chips are down you are alone.” And yet, after thesehorrific experiences in the war, her steel core remained tempered by a senseof optimism that may have been battered but still proved resilient: “I’ve beenoften through hell, but I’ve always come out at the other end.”

While Audrey was surviving the war in the Netherlands, her father Josephhad lived out the entire war in a Brixton, England, prison. Having been arres-ted in July 1940 under Defense Regulation 18 B as an associate of foreignfascists, he did not gain release until April 1945. Once freed, he moved to Ire-land (which had declared neutrality during the war), residing there for the restof his life. At war’s end, Audrey made no immediate attempt to find herfather, although she knew where he had relocated: “I didn’t try to reach him.By then the war had been over for months and he had never tried to reach me,nor had I ever heard from him in the ten months between my leaving Englandand Holland’s occupation. So, the feelings of reaction were very strong, and Ithought he didn’t want to see me anymore.”

Having survived the Nazis, in the postwar summer of 1945, Audreyworked as a volunteer nurse’s aide in the Royal Military Invalids Home forveterans, and together with Ella soon relocated to Amsterdam. By now, danceteacher Winja Marova had recommended Audrey to Sonia Gaskell, thefounder of the Netherlands Dutch National Ballet, and as she gained strengthand weight, Audrey began lessons with Gaskell at the state-run dance school,Balletstudio 45. Lack of money remained an enormous problem, so to fundher lessons, Audrey began making high-fashion hats, selling them to thewealthy women Ella met while peddling cosmetics door to door. So short ofcash was Audrey that she even began making her own ballet tights out of Acebandages dyed in water filled with red crepe paper.

Gaskell’s methods proved grueling, and she drilled Audrey and her fellow

pupils for hours on end until the steps morphed into muscle memory. Re-called Audrey: “Sonia taught me that if you really worked hard, you’d suc-ceed.” That hard work, in Audrey’s view, helped make up for a multitude ofsins: “I’ve been constantly in situations in my life and career where I’ve hadno technique, but if you just feel enough, you will get away with murder.”

She was now also training under the relentless eye of the Russian balletteacher Olga Tarassova. Ironically, it was life with the “terribly strict” Ellathat had prepared Audrey for Tarassova’s exacting instructions: “I wouldtrain for two or three hours at a time and even if I were purple in the face andcovered with sweat, she would shout ‘Stand up, van Heemstra—don’tslouch!’ That gave me strength.”

Her fellow dancers were the first to notice Audrey’s inherent dramaticability. Anneke van Wijk observed that Audrey possessed a remarkable abil-ity to project emotion with her hands and eyes while dancing, and Ida de Jongthen gave Audrey a crucial push toward a new life, insisting that she move toEngland: “You’ll have a lot more opportunities there, and you don’t have toask to come in, because you are half English.”

The seed for a move to England had been planted, but while Audrey stilllived in Holland, the need for money loomed ever larger. When her balletclass was visited by the Dutch film director Charles Van der Linden, it wasAudrey, “the tall, thin girl with the eyes” who captured his attention. On thelookout for attractive young women to cast in his film Nederlands in ZevenLessen (Dutch in Seven Lessons, also known as Dutch at the Double in theEnglish-language version), he offered Audrey a job. Delighted by the salary—by any salary—she quickly accepted. Grateful as she was, however,Audrey’s reaction was mixed with a caveat for director Van der Linden: “Iam not an actress. You will regret it.”

Her matter-of-fact assessment notwithstanding, Audrey took on the role ofa stewardess, imaginatively named . . . “Audrey.” So low was the budget thather screen test, for which Audrey had worn her best dress, hat, and gloves,was included in the final edit of the film. Shot at the Schiphol airport in Ams-terdam, the negligible film featured eighteen-year-old Audrey sporting astewardess cap perched on top of her long, wavy hair. She was called upon todo little but smile, and after the film premiered on May 7, 1948, she dis-covered that her minimal dialogue had been edited out of the English-lan-guage version: she had been onscreen for fewer than sixty seconds.

She happily collected a paycheck of fifty guilders and spent little timethinking about a career in film. None of it mattered to her in the slightest be-cause just over the horizon, London and the glamorous world of balletbeckoned.

“Arthur Rubenstein had a difficult early life. He had to decide whether toreject life or to love it. He decided to love it unconditionally—and I believein that.”

—Audrey Hepburn

AFTER SUCCESSFULLY AUDITIONING IN 1948 for the London based Marie RambertSchool of Ballet, nineteen-year-old Audrey arrived in England armed with anofficially stamped letter from B. E. F. Gage, counsellor at the British Em-bassy in the Hague. Dated April 10, 1948, and addressed “To Whom It MayConcern,” the letter stated that “Miss Audrey Hepburn-Ruston is known tome as a British subject. She has been for some time a student of ballet dan-cing and is proceeding to the United Kingdom to study at the Rambert Schoolof Ballet Dancing.”

Audrey gratefully accepted Rambert’s offer of a partial scholarship, whichallowed her to receive free room and board for six months. Along with theroom came a flatmate, Christina Brooks, who nearly seventy years later re-membered Audrey vividly: “She desperately wanted to be a dancer. Youcould recognize her star quality right away. She had a beautiful smile. Andwhen she started to dance, she made everyone want to dance with her.”

A new life was beginning, and with it came a new name: Audrey Hep-burn-Ruston would henceforth be known as Audrey Hepburn. She had a newname, little money, and no definite career prospects, but she was ecstatic totaste the freedom found in England: “The world was functioning again.Above all there was a wonderful quality of hope, born from relief and gratit-ude for those greatest of all luxuries—freedom and peace.”

Audrey, however, lagged far behind the other students. Five years of near

starvation had left her with a deficit in technique and too much ground tomake up. At five feet, seven inches, she proved too tall to be paired withmany of the male dancers; as Rambert explained, Audrey might be able tojoin the corps de ballet, but she would never graduate to the rank of primaballerina.

The news proved a devastating blow, and in later years Audrey confessedto her son Sean that as she walked home after her talk with Rambert, she allat once realized that “her dream had died.” She was crushed, but rather thanwait around for any scraps the ballet world might toss her way, she reactedwith a characteristic combination of sadness and practicality. She would lookfor and accept any sort of work that might come her way: “I might have toslave for years (in ballet) to achieve only limited success. I couldn’t waityears. I needed money badly.”

To supplement her income, Audrey began modeling for photographers,and in the process learned the first practical tools which would stand her ingood stead onscreen: “bright colors overpower me and wash me out.” Printads started coming her way, the most prominent being a stint for photo-grapher Angus McBean as the face of Lacto-Calamine powder, with the adsfeaturing the oddball tagline: “A powder base by day, a skin food by night.”

By now, Ella had also moved to London, undertaking a wide assortment ofjobs unthinkable in her prewar life. Work was the key, and if it meant jobsranging from florist, cook, and beautician to manager of an apartment build-ing and door to door saleswoman of cosmetics, then that’s exactly what shewould do. Grandson Sean gives all credit to Ella: “Ella was a single momwho after the war moved to London with no money, helped my mother get ascholarship at Marie Rambert and undertook any job possible to help makeends meet. If it meant washing stairs, then that is what she did.” With Ellarushing from one job to another, and Audrey facing a life without ballet, apractical decision had to be reached: how could Audrey actually earn a livingwhile still dancing?

An unexpected answer now popped up: Audrey Kathleen Hepburn wouldbegin dancing in London’s West End. As a musical comedy chorine.

# Chapter FiveCHORUS GIRL, 1948–1949

“I tried always to do better: saw always a little further. I tried to stretchmyself.”

—Audrey Hepburn

AUDREY HEPBURN, WHOSE ETHEREAL AIR could not have been more different fromthat of the standard jaded West End dancer, seemed an unlikely candidate foran eight-times-a-week, sell-it-to-the-last-row job as a chorus girl, but inDecember of 1948 she landed a job in the London production of the Broad-way musical hit High Button Shoes. Had Audrey’s dancing instantly wowedthe director and choreographer? Not in the least. But her personality, that ar-istocratic but approachable persona, had successfully carried the day. Wroteco-producer Jack Hylton on her audition card: “Lousy dancer. Great verve.”The job was hers.

She had one line, the immortal “Have they all gone?” Well, it was a startand for now, she was delighted to be in a show, embracing the camaraderieof dancing in a bright, splashy musical comedy: “I loved being in a musicalshow. For the first time, I felt the pure joy of living.”

Cecil Landau, a producer of musical revues, saw Audrey in High ButtonShoes and noticed her at once. Far from being the anonymous second chorusgirl from the left, she registered with surprising impact: “I saw a girl comerunning across the stage. I remember two black eyes and a fringe. I got veryexcited.” He quickly cast her in the 1949 revue Sauce Tartare, where shewould be one of five dancing girls and participate in the show’s series ofsatirical sketches. If the material was not exactly worthy of Chekhov—in oneshe played a “Boogie Woogie Yoga Follower”—Landau nonethelessprovided encouragement and cast her again in the next year’s follow up re-

vue, Sauce Piquante, where the quality of both her roles and salary increased:from boogie woogie yoga follower to Dresden shepherdess, and from tenpounds weekly to fifteen.

It was during Sauce Piquante that for the first and last time ever, Audreyallowed herself to be talked into a slight adjustment of her natural look. Pressagent Frederic Mullally had set up a photo shoot featuring the then de rigueurglamour shots at his offices in Mayfair. Told that these would be pin-up pic-tures, and that she should arrive in shorts and a low-necked sweater, Audreyarrived with shorts—and a high-necked sweater. Mullally’s partner SuzanneWarner took one look and blanched. In her own words: “The trouble was thatthe sweater was certainly doing nothing for Audrey—and Audrey was doingas near as nothing to the sweater!” Pulling Audrey aside, Suzanne suggestedthat she employ falsies to build up her bosom. Audrey refused. Mullally andWarner pleaded, and the young Audrey at last agreed—very reluctantly. Theensuing photos of Audrey sporting an adjusted appearance were published inthe London Sunday newspapers. Wrote Audrey’s biographer Ian Woodward:“A copy of the picture went into Mullally’s office files, with the caption:‘Audrey Hepburn—and friends.’” The youngster had capitulated this onetime, but in the future, no matter the pressure or the budget, she would neveragain change her appearance.

She was, however, determined to improve herself, and she signed up totake acting classes with Betty and Philip Buchell, as well as elocution lessonswith actor Felix Aylmer (Polonius to Laurence Olivier’s Hamlet). It wasAylmer who provided Audrey with a lesson that would serve her well, notjust onstage but also in her still nascent film career: the value of stillness. Letthe audience come to you.

Her ambition was palpable, as was her work ethic, and while performingin High Button Shoes, taking ballet classes, and studying with both Aylmerand the Buchells, she was also performing in Sauce Tartare and an additionalshow entitled Christmas Party. Arriving home in the early hours of the morn-ing, Audrey would eat, sleep, and step right back into rehearsal at 10 a.m.: “Iwas very ambitious and took every opportunity. I wanted to learn and Iwanted to be seen.”

If, in future years, acting never brought her the all-encompassing joy thatdancing did, Audrey’s practical bent overrode all; as late as the 1980s, whenasked in a television interview if she was disappointed by her failure to make

a career of ballet, she answered: “Deep down, ballet was my dream. I still geta lump in my throat from watching dance—I’m terribly moved. But I can’tsay today how disappointed I am because I’ve had such good fortune—beengiven so much.”

In son Sean’s view: “Acting was in effect a default choice because she hadto work. As she gained great success, she remained very thankful to be self-supporting; she was, for parts of my childhood, a single mother who raisedme and earned her own way. At that time, in certain countries womencouldn’t even wear pants or open a bank account without their husbands, butby choosing a career as an actor she forged her own path.” Several years afterher initial success in Roman Holiday, Audrey herself bluntly observed: “Onlythe absolutely determined people succeed.” In the words of her soon-to-be-director William Wyler: “She struck me as being very alert, very smart, verytalented, very ambitious.”

Actor and aspiring director Richard Attenborough saw her in one of theSauce revues and later said, “Everybody knew there was something totallyremarkable about her and that sooner or later, she was going to become a ma-jor, major, movie star.” If this statement rings of after-the-fact hyperbole, itnonetheless confirmed what everyone already felt: Audrey Hepburn was anoriginal. But an original what?

# Chapter SixA STAR IS (NOT QUITE YET) BORN, 1950–1951

“Even in her early films, her height, her skinniness and her wistfulnesscombined to get her noticed.”

— “Audrey Hepburn: An Iconic Problem,” The Guardian

AUDREY’S FOCUS MAY HAVE REMAINED on dance and theatre, but with her drivingambition, she certainly did not rule out future film appearances, so when theopportunity to audition came about, her attitude was one of why not? Whichis how, in the summer of 1950, she came to audition for the role of Lygia inthe MGM big budget epic Quo Vadis. Director Mervyn LeRoy thought hertest terrific; the powers at MGM did not.

A screen test for Lady Godiva Rides Again went nowhere. She tested forthe forgettable Valley of the Eagles and struck out once again, yet just ashappened with Mervyn LeRoy, Eagles director Terence Young fell forAudrey, pronouncing her “utterly enchanting.” In later years he explained: “Ithought she was going to make it, and I hoped one day she would rememberme, and get me to direct.” Seventeen years hence, Young’s wish would begranted—twice.

It was at the time of these unsuccessful screen tests that John McCallumand his wife, actress Googie Withers, stopped by Ciro’s, where Audrey wasperforming in the short-lived revue Summer Night. Instantly struck byAudrey’s charisma, they recommended her to casting director RobertLennard at Associated British Pictures Corporation (ABC). The highly re-garded Lennard, who cast films for both John Huston and Fred Zinnemann,had seen and liked Audrey in Sauce Piquante, and with the guidance of herrecently acquired agent Jack Dunfee, Audrey now signed a three-picture con-tract. She would be paid 500 pounds for a first film, before jumping to 1,500

pounds for the remaining films.

Audrey was off and running, but unfortunately right into films of dubiousquality. In addition to an August television appearance in “The Silent Vil-lage” on BBC Night Theatre, there were four very brief appearances in 1951alone. She was first loaned out for the forgettable One Wild Oat, a moviewhich occupied her for exactly three days and resulted in a twenty-second ap-pearance as a hotel receptionist exclaiming: “Good afternoon, this is the Re-gency Hotel.” (Thirteen years later, she was to be reunited with the star ofOne Wild Oat, Stanley Holloway, on the infinitely more rewarding My FairLady.)

Even with this blink-and-you’ll-miss-her appearance, casting directorLennard was taken with the twenty-two-year-old Audrey and brought Italianfilm director Mario Zampi to see her at Ciro’s. So impressed was Zampi thathe offered her the lead role in his new movie Laughter in Paradise. It was anunexpected and impressive offer for a newcomer, but the newly in loveAudrey wanted to pursue a possible tour with her then boyfriend Marcel Le-Bon, and declined the role, writing Zampi: “I’m sorry. I’ve just signed to do ashort tour in a show. I can’t break the contract. It wouldn’t be fair.” Due to alack of financing, the tour bookings with LeBon then fell through, and, upsetthat she had turned down a film to accommodate his plans, Audrey began toargue with LeBon. In the words of Warren Harris: “A battle royal ensued,ending with the hot-blooded Frenchman severing the relationship by signingup for a nitery revue being sent to the United States and Canada.” Achastened Audrey returned to Zampi in hopes that his offer still stood. It didnot, the part having been given to Beatrice Campbell. Offered a bit part in-stead—Zampi barked, “You start and finish on the same day”—she immedi-ately said yes. Playing a cigarette girl who is glimpsed wearing a white apronover a short dress, she addresses ladies’ man Guy Middleton with a saucy:“Hello! Who wants a ciggy?” That one line was followed shortly thereafterby, “Don’t I count as a woman?” End of appearance.

Her third film of 1951, Young Wives Tale proved flimsy in the extreme,with Audrey playing a single woman working as a typist while living in anextremely crowded boardinghouse. This time she appeared in seven scenes,but the scenes and the film itself are of negligible import, landing with littleor no impact. The movie may actually be most noteworthy as the one film inwhich Audrey quarreled with her director, in this instance, Henry Cass.

Audrey, for reasons unknown to everyone but Cass, was the object of hisconstant criticism, and she later admitted: “He had it in for me. It was theonly unhappy experience I ever had making a picture.” In what would proveto be a typically generous and self-deprecating analysis, Audrey refused toassign blame to Cass, adding, “I was probably dreadful in it!”

Onward.

Lavender Hill Mob with Alec Guinness. Audrey had only one line, but, said Guinness:“Her faunlike beauty and presence were remarkable.” Universal Pictures/Photofest $©$ Uni-versal Pictures

# Chapter Seven

# A SINGLE LINE AND ALEC GUINNESS, 1951–1952

“We all have our blind spots . . . I paid no particular attention to her.”

—Sir Michael Balcon, chair of Ealing Studios

ONE MONTH AFTER YOUNG WIVES TALES was released, Audrey appeared briefly inEaling Studio’s Lavender Hill Mob, an amusing tale about a shipping clerkwho devises a plan for stealing one million pounds in gold from the Bank ofEngland. The film proved a big hit, winning an Academy Award for T. E. B.Clarke’s screenplay and a nod as the “Best British Film” of the year from theBritish Film Academy.

Audrey had exactly two lines as “Chiquita,” but she made them count.Greeting star Alec Guinness at the airport after he gives her a goodbyepresent of cash to “get yourself a little birthday present,” Chiquita delightedlyresponds “Oh, but how sweet of you! Thank you.” That may have been theend of Audrey’s screen time, but even while Guinness proved rather unim-pressed by her acting ability, he was captivated by her star personality: “Sheonly had half a line to say, and I don’t think she said it in any particular or in-teresting way. But her fawnlike beauty and presence were remarkable.”

Not that everyone else immediately saw Audrey’s potential. It wasn’t justEaling Studios chairman Sir Michael Balcon who saw little promise in thenewcomer; screenwriter Tibby Clarke claimed that Audrey “struck nobody asstar material.” But Balcon and Clarke aside, even in these miniscule parts,Audrey Hepburn did in fact register, and for one crucial reason common toall movie stars: the camera loved her. The cheekbones, the soulful eyes, andthe vivid intelligence all registered with remarkable impact.

In Audrey’s own assessment, the six movies she made between 1950 and

1951 “made a total of one quick appearance,” but she had impressed AlecGuinness to such an extent that he personally recommended her to Holly-wood power Mervyn LeRoy, who later recalled: “I never remember Guinnessrecommending anyone else to me, before or since. He even said he didn’tthink she could act, but that she was beautiful, so delicate, it didn’t matter.Those are interesting words coming from a consummate actor! . . . I wantedto see this amazing creature myself.” Raved Peter Ustinov, “With the perfectbone structure of her face, she seemed to possess the secret of a youth ver-ging on the eternal, and yet the poise of maturity was already with her from avery early age.” Flowery, yes—but also true.

And then, in November 1950, Audrey was tested by Thorold Dickinsonfor her first substantial role, that of “Nora Brentano,” in Ealing Studio’s TheSecret People. If cast, Audrey would be playing not only the second femalelead in the movie, but also a role she could slip into with great ease—that of aballet student. The female lead in the film, political exile “Maria Brent,” wasto be played by the estimable Valentina Cortese, who proved to be an earlyally of Audrey’s. Cortese had looked at the tests of the four girls vying for therole of Nora and was instantly struck by the unknown-to-her Audrey: “abeautiful little thing, like a little deer, with this long neck and those big eyes.”Won over by Audrey’s modesty (she naively asked Valentina off camera—“Do you think I have a chance?”), Cortese quickly advised the newcomerto take off her shoes so that she wouldn’t appear too tall on camera. The partwas hers.

Filmed in 1951 and released in 1952, The Secret People centered aroundan assassination in a European country and gave Audrey a chance to danceonscreen. Her dancing is solid, although it’s interesting to note that while herdancing in the classroom scenes is on full point, in the film’s actual ballet se-quences, she only dances on half-point. Perhaps the years of dancing in WestEnd shows and revues had left her less than confident in her ballet technique,and Sidney Cole, the film’s producer, later theorized that “the ballet sceneswere a great strain for her—far greater a challenge, in a way, than the scenescalling for acting and spoken dialogue.”

Her hard-to-place accent, replete with hints of English, French, and Dutch,intrigues, but also makes it seem highly unlikely that she was raised in thesame family as her Italian-accented “sister” Cortese. She does, however,make the most of her close-ups, the first proof positive of her ability to pro-

ject complex emotions on camera. Accents and the heavy-handed plot aside,Audrey is, for the first time, noticeable onscreen, and even in this relativelysmall part, she snagged above the title billing. Said critic Pauline Kael in lateryears: “With the young Audrey Hepburn in a sizable role, it’s rather like see-ing Cinderella before the transformation.”

She was gaining in confidence and learning the intricacies of script con-struction. The film had reunited her with fellow revue performer Bob Monk-house, who was now spending his spare time on set banging out multiplescripts for three radio shows. In a telling and humorous anecdote, whileMonkhouse worked on a routine about his very poor childhood, Audrey ob-served him struggling for the right jokes, and finally suggested a “poverty”joke of her own: Monkhouse’s family was so poor that they didn’t havecheese to put in their mousetrap, and instead had to draw a picture of cheeseto put in the trap. Monkhouse liked the gag but explained it wasn’t a full joke,at which point Audrey instantly supplied the capper: “All right . . . you couldthen say that you then caught a picture of a mouse.” Setup, joke, and payoff:she was beginning to understand all of it.

Serious at heart, she still found humor in everyday situations; AlfredShaughnessy, who went on to become the principal writer on television’s Up-stairs, Downstairs, was trying to convince Audrey to play the part of “Pet-ronilla” in his new script entitled Brandy for the Parson. Visiting Audrey onthe set of Secret People, he gave her his script, which she returned the verynext day, explaining with a smile that she liked the script but “couldn’t playScene 42. The censor wouldn’t allow it.” Puzzled by Audrey’s reaction towhat he felt was a very wholesome script, he raced to scene 42, which read:

Scene 42. Int. Cabin of Yacht. Day (Studio)

Petronilla is awake, dressed in Bill’s pyjamas. She is peeing outof the porthole.

Laughed Shaughnessy: “The ladies in the script-typing pool had omitted theletter ‘r,’ either by accident or design.”

Audrey, in fact, was interested in the role of Petronilla, but the film was toshoot at the same time as Monte Carlo Baby, to which she had already com-mitted.

While Secret People was to prove an important steppingstone in Audrey’sfilm career, perhaps its greatest impact on her life came from her interactionwith stars Serge Reggiani and Valentina Cortese. From Reggiani she learnedthe value of not discussing one’s personal life with the press; after stardomcame her way, she proved unfailingly polite with journalists but wouldfirmly, albeit with a smile, change the subject when it came to in-depth prob-ing of personal matters. At the same time, from Valentina she learned thevalue of taking a cautious, distanced approach when dealing with Hollywood.Regarding the hothouse atmosphere of that one industry town, Cortese ad-vised: “Think hard before you sign a long-term contract. Liberty is the mostwonderful thing of all.”

Cortese’s advice ultimately changed the trajectory of Audrey’s personaland professional lives, but after completing The Secret People, Audrey’s fo-cus remained upon her contractual obligation to shoot Monte Carlo Baby(also known as Baby Beats the Band). Audrey knew the script was mere fluffand once again asked Valentina Cortese for advice. Should she actually makethe film? Recalled Cortese: “I said, ‘If the cast is No. 1, if the director is No.1, even if the part is not No. 1—do it. Maybe something else comes out of it.”

Audrey had doubts, but, she rationalized, the film meant a trip to MonteCarlo with her mother, as well as the chance to keep a Dior dress she wasscheduled to wear in the film. With her fluent command of French, Audreywas also the only cast member scheduled to appear in both the French- (NousIrons a Monte Carlo) and English-language versions of the film. As it turnedout, when the film was released in 1954 after Roman Holiday had establishedher as a star of the first rank, Oscar Godbout of the New York Times wrote:“She made this one before she became a [movie star] in reality. It is rather as-tonishing how she stands out in that seared desert of mediocrity. Miss Hep-burn saves Monte Carlo Baby from being completely worthless.”

Monte Carlo Baby may have registered as a by the numbers low budgetprogrammer, but it was to prove a decisive turning point in Audrey’s lifewhen the location shoot brought her into the direct gaze of novelist andflinty-eyed observer Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette. Colette’s “discovery” ofAudrey soon became legendary, but whichever version of the legend is actu-ally true, one fact remains: the events in question played out in such a wildlyimprobable who-could-make-this-up fashion that it made A Star Is Born looklike cinema verité.

# Chapter EightDISCOVERY BY COLETTE, 1951–1952

“With no actress cast, Colette became a ‘compulsive Gigi spotter’ acrossFrance and often shouted, ‘There! She’s the one! She’s my Gigi!’”

—Robert Matzen

WHEN VALENTINA CORTESE URGED AUDREY to occasionally accept lesser roles be-cause “maybe something else comes out of it,” she was, in fact, speaking ofMonte Carlo Baby, an eminently forgettable film if ever there was one. Buteven the worldly Cortese could never have predicted that while shooting thistrifle in Monte Carlo, Audrey would fall under the scrutiny of Colette, whowas focused on finding just the right young woman to star in the stage adapt-ation of her most famous novel, Gigi.

Gigi, first published in 1944, had in fact already been turned into a 1948French film starring Daniele Delorme. The blockbuster Academy Award–winning MGM musical film of the same title was to arrive in 1958, but in1951, Colette was focused upon finding a theater actress to bring her creationto life. Who had the skill and personal charisma to help audiences accept astory centering around a charming young adolescent who is being groomedfor the life of a courtesan? Given the iffy nature of the material, it was, to becertain, a tall order.

With Colette’s approval, producer Gilbert Miller had enlisted Anita Loosof Gentlemen Prefer Blondes fame to script the adaptation, and top Holly-wood director George Cukor had even agreed to return to his theatrical rootsand direct. It was, however, Colette herself who held veto power over castand script, and as the start of rehearsals loomed, no actress Colette deemedacceptable had been glimpsed, let alone signed.

It was at just this juncture that the author, who was staying at the marble

and gold-mirrored Hotel de Paris as the guest of Prince Rainier, observed apretty young girl with rather sparkling eyes and a dazzling smile dancingaround a group of musicians during a break in the filming of Nous Irons aMonte Carlo. The battle-toughened Colette was instantaneously charmed,later recalling her reaction as a startled “Voila! There is my Gigi! This un-known young woman was my own thoroughly French Gigi come alive!”Never mind that Colette had felt the same way about numerous other Gigisthat she had spotted in her travels—this young girl held her interest.

Beckoning Audrey over to her wheelchair, Colette conversed in Frenchwith the fluent youngster, firing off a series of questions: “What is yourname?” “Are you a part of this movie?” “Are you the star of the movie?”Audrey, shy yet amused at the thought of being considered the possible starof the movie, responded with a smiling “Non, Madame.” With Audrey calledback to the set, a by now thoroughly charmed Colette dispatched her husbandMaurice Goudeket to send a telegram to Gilbert Miller: “Do Not Cast YourGigi Until You Read My Letter.”

The letter in question proved to be a missive detailing what were, inColette’s mind, Audrey’s rather extraordinary charms: “This would be a verygood Gigi . . . I believe she has had little experience on the stage, but she isvery pretty and has that piquant quality necessary for the part.” “Piquant” wasthe first of the many adjectives, nouns, and adverbs writers were to willinglyemploy in an attempt to describe Audrey’s unique charms: doe-eyed, elfin,will-o-the-wisp, ethereal—all of these were to come, but for now Colette pro-nounced herself charmed—and Audrey piquant.

It all makes for a terrific story, but was this really how Audrey was dis-covered? If everyone who claimed to have been present when Colette firstlaid eyes on Audrey had actually been in Monte Carlo, the Hotel de Pariswould have been bursting at the seams. It was, in the end, Audrey herselfwho best relayed the tale, recounting the events with characteristic under-statement. In Audrey’s recall, there was no dramatic scene of Colette shout-ing “Voila—Here is my Gigi,” but instead, a straightforward acknowledg-ment that “Colette was very ill with arthritis or rheumatism and was in awheelchair, in a corner of the hall. I was standing in the lobby and Colettesaid to her husband, ‘Maybe this is the girl that’s right.’” The novelist con-sidered her a possibility. A definite maybe.

Did Audrey leap at the opportunity, assuring Colette that she wouldn’t re-

gret her choice? Not a bit. Instead, she asked Colette how she, Audrey, couldpossibly perform in a play when she had never created a dramatic role in thetheatre. As to the mere idea of Colette suggesting it, why “what a crazy thingto say . . .” Colette was undeterred, telling the youngster: “You’re a dancer.You know how to work hard.” Yes, Audrey admitted, she was a dancer, andyes, as Madame could hear, she was fluent in French. Plusses to be sure, butwhat intrigued Colette even more was Audrey’s very evident sangfroid andcontinental flair, qualities in short supply with the young American womenwho had been considered for the role.

Audrey remained uncertain. Turning to fellow Monte Carlo Baby castmember Marcel Dalio for advice, she was told: “Follow your instincts. If itfeels right, it will be right.” With Colette continuing to express interest,Audrey, sensing that the author was not just curious but actually engaged, de-murred no longer: if Madame believed in her, then she would certainly do herbest.

Did Audrey have doubts about the material itself? The plot and verythemes did present underlying problems, but such were the times that mater-ial which strikes modern audiences as smarmy in the extreme was, in 1951,considered charmingly adult and naughty. In the words of Anita Loos: “It’s aCinderella story told in terms of sex. The play loses everything unless the act-ress looks like an absolute child. Yet she has to have the kind of charm thatwould make a worldly man fall in love with a sixteen-year-old girl.” Onegeneration’s charming roue, another generation’s criminal . . .

But for now, Audrey had to complete her roles in both Nous Irons a MonteCarlo and Monte Carlo Baby. Playing a movie star chasing after her missingbaby in a series of comedic set pieces did not exactly plum unexpected depthsin Audrey’s acting, but the twelve-minute role had brought her to MonteCarlo, and, she rationalized, who knew what might happen with Gigi.

At the conclusion of filming, she returned to London and was immediatelycontacted by Gigi’s producer, Gilbert Miller. A deal was struck. Thirteenyears later, Audrey would be paid $\$ 1$ million to star in the film version of MyFair Lady, but for now she would play eight performances of Gigi each weekfor a salary of $\$ 500$ . And oh yes, she would have to pay for all of her ownliving accommodations in New York City.

Paying for her own housing wouldn’t stop her, but what might do so wereher ever-growing self-doubts. Had she made a terrible mistake by saying yes?

Could she really handle the role? What if Colette thought her story wasruined because of Audrey? The doubts plaguing Audrey would continuethroughout her career, but neither Colette nor her husband harbored any suchreservations, with Goudeket forthrightly stating: “She is greatly thought of byfilm people generally and considered a future star of the first magnitude.”

Audrey arrived in New York in October of 1951 for the start of rehearsals,and for the first and last time in her adult life, appeared to be overweight.Having feasted on the luxurious and plentiful meals on the transatlantic cross-ing, Audrey’s appearance shocked Gilbert Miller and his general managerMorton Gottlieb. Was this rather sturdy young woman appearing in front ofthem the youngster they had been informed was downright sylph-like? Tak-ing matters in hand, Gottlieb immediately placed Audrey on a diet,whereupon she lost the weight and never gained it back.

The real problems, however, began at the start of rehearsals, with the inex-perienced Audrey floundering badly. She could not be heard beyond the firstthree rows of the orchestra, had only a rudimentary understanding of appro-priate onstage body language, and had trouble memorizing her rather lengthypart. It was stage veteran Cathleen Nesbitt, playing Gigi’s “Aunt Alicia,” whotook Audrey under her wing and saved her. Said Nesbitt, who in later yearsgained nationwide fame on television’s The Farmer’s Daughter: “Audreydidn’t have much idea of phrasing, and even less of how to project. But shehad that rare thing—audience authority—that makes everybody look at you.”

By now, the delays in production had caused the in-demand George Cukorto depart, and he had been replaced by the Belgian Raymond Rouleau. Roul-eau was not impressed by Audrey, indeed often despairing of her sketchy the-atrical skills, and the rehearsal process was further complicated by the factthat Rouleau’s shaky command of English made it virtually impossible forhim to direct the cast. A solution was jerry-rigged: because everyone in thecast spoke French, Anita Loos translated her play into French for Rouleau.He then directed in French, and the cast spoke their lines in French, whilesimultaneously trying to translate words and actions into English for the up-coming Broadway audiences.

To help Audrey find her bearing onstage, Rouleau began coaching her inhow to move about the stage, hoping that her liquid grace and natural charmwould, as Loos herself stated, “blind the audience to her deficiencies.” Con-tinued Loos: “He staged the play practically like a ballet.” Rouleau was not

shy about accepting credit for the end result, and after his death, his widowwrote Charles Higham to relay Rouleau’s statement that “the actors all fol-lowed me so completely that if I had asked them to throw themselves in theHudson they would happily had done so.”

Problems and all, Audrey already thoroughly understood the importanceof her look onstage, and she layered her performance through use of theperiod clothes as well as the styled fall of her shoulder-length hair. Lookingthe part helped her feel the part: “Once you’re in a three-quarter-length dress,with a rustling petticoat underneath and with high button shoes on your feet,you feel something. You walk differently, sit differently . . . I truly felt likesixteen, so I was halfway there.”

Audrey may have been frightened, but she was also exhilarated and un-questionably self-aware. Her publicity photos for Gigi were to be taken byRichard Avedon himself, and while their paths were to cross again on moreequal terms six years later on Funny Face, for now the neophyte recognizedthe value in listening to the master. In a lesson that was to stay with Audreythroughout her extraordinary run as a magazine cover girl, it was Avedonwho was the first to suggest she try to pose in three-quarter profile, her headangled “so that her high cheekbones slimmed the lower part of her face.”Audrey complied, and just as they usually did, Avedon’s photos caused animmediate stir. The twenty-one-year-old Broadway newcomer may havebeen both unknown and untested, but she was already proving herself a mas-ter at self-presentation.

As Gigi underwent a grueling out-of-town tryout in Philadelphia, producerGilbert Miller remained so dismayed by Audrey’s performance that he con-templated firing her, refraining from doing so only because there was no oneto replace her on such short notice. Rehearsing endlessly, Audrey slowlygained in confidence, her projection and command of the stage improvingwith each performance, and by the time the play opened at New York City’sFulton Theatre on November 24, 1951, she had gained enormously in onstageauthority.

While the critics may have been very mixed as to the quality of the play it-self, their praise for Audrey proved fulsome: Enthused Richard Watts Jr.:“The delightful Miss Hepburn obviously is not an experienced actress. Buther quality is so winning and so right that she is the success of the evening. . .. Miss Hepburn is as fresh and frisky as a puppy out of a tub.” The highly es-

teemed Elliot Norton, writing in the Boston Post, trumpeted: “She was at easeon the stage as though she had been born to it,” and her personal triumph wassealed by the all-important New York Times who called her “a young actressof charm, honesty and talent.”

In addition to winning a 1952 Theatre World Award, Audrey was nomin-ated for a Tony Award as Best Actress in a Play alongside three genuine le-gends: Helen Hayes for Mrs. McThing, Jessica Tandy in The Fourposter, andJulie Harris (the winner) for I Am a Camera (Harris, in fact, had once beenmentioned to play Gigi). So rapturous were the notices that with the agree-ment of Cathleen Nesbitt, only one week after the play opened, Audrey’sname was placed in lights above the title. A marquee reading “GIGI withAudrey Hepburn” had quickly become “AUDREY HEPBURN in GIGI.” SaidAudrey: “Oh, dear, and I still have to learn how to act.”

This was not a bit of well-timed self-deprecating humor aimed at scoringfavor but rather the manifestation of a deeply ingrained self-doubt. She con-tinued to take dance classes, and in her own candid self-assessment: “I’mhalfway between a dancer and an actress. I’ve got to learn.” As her careergathered force and the adulation began, far from reveling in the attentioncoming her way, she plaintively commented: “All I feel is a responsibility tolive up to success.”

Audiences raved as much as critics, but not everyone was impressed, andAudrey came in for the same sort of sniping from Noël Coward as had better-known actors. In a typical diary entry, he noted of Gigi: “An orgy of overact-ing and a vulgar script . . . Audrey Hepburn inexperienced and rather toonoisy, and the whole thing badly directed.” Coward, however, represented adecided minority, and the show quickly assumed sellout status. Colette pro-nounced herself thrilled, inscribing a photo to Audrey: “To Audrey Hepburn,the treasure I found on the beach.”

It was all heady stuff, but having been brought up in the Ella van Heem-stra school of “Don’t talk about yourself—you’re no better than anyone else,”Audrey’s feet remained planted firmly on the ground. Asked about her newlyfound fame, Audrey replied: “I thought being the ‘Toast of Broadway’ mightmean people standing up and raising champagne glasses. But no one has everdone that. I thought it might mean sailing into restaurants when they were fulland getting a table with just a smile at the head waiter. But Jimmy didn’t riskit—he booked in advance.”

Gigi seemed set for a long and lucrative run, yet producer Miller wasasked if he would close the show by May 31, 1952. Why? Because Para-mount Pictures wanted Audrey Hepburn to star in its upcoming WilliamWyler–directed production of Roman Holiday. Miller agreed—on two condi-tions: (1) He was to be compensated handsomely, the agreed-upon figure be-ing $\$ 50,000$ ($550,000 in today’s money) and (2) Shooting of Roman Holi-day had to finish by the end of September 1952, in order for Audrey to star ina national tour of Gigi. With Miller’s demands satisfied, Paramount now an-nounced that Broadway’s newest star would play the lead in William Wyler’sRoman Holiday.

Suddenly the unknown, self-described “inexperienced and untutored” act-ress was one of the hottest commodities in show business. And “commodity”was the word: Audrey had rehearsed and opened in Gigi, and at that sametime made a striking appearance on the television show We the People. Shealso found time on February 10, 1952, to perform a scene from Nine Days aQueen with Rex Harrison on Ed Sullivan’s television show Toast of theTown, followed by both the April CBS telecast of “Rainy Day in ParadiseJunction” and the Betty Crocker Star Matinee episode “The Stove Won’tLight.” She topped off her run by rushing to Europe to film Roman Holiday,starred in a whirlwind national tour of Gigi—and exhausted herself into aseverely needed rest cure.

That, however, is getting ahead of the story, and in 1952, one giantobstacle remained in Audrey’s path on her lightning-fast rush to internationalstardom. How could an actress with just one Broadway credit and a handfulof glorified screen cameos land the leading role in a high-profile ParamountPictures production to be directed by the notoriously demanding WilliamWyler?

The answer: With a little luck, a lot of talent, and an exquisite sense oftiming.

# Chapter NineROMAN HOLIDAY, 1951–1953

“I was born with something that appealed to audiences at that particulartime. It has never ceased to puzzle and dazzle me, in a way, that thishappened.”

—Audrey Hepburn

ROMAN HOLIDAY BEGAN LIFE AS the rare film whose star—in this case, screen-writer Dalton Trumbo—could not be acknowledged. A go-to screenwriterwith credits ranging from soap opera (the Oscar-winning Kitty Foyle 1940) tothe taut and nasty Gun Crazy (1950), Trumbo was the rarest of creatures inHollywood—the screenwriter as star. He was also, in the early 1950s, a manbeing investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)for his supposed Communist leanings; with an all-but-certain jail term await-ing him, he needed to write a blatantly commercial film to support his familywhile he was away. Inspired by the headline-generating romance of Britain’sPrincess Margaret and Peter Townsend, he set to work.

Aware that his name was politically radioactive, Trumbo requested thathis story of an overly protected youthful princess who yearns for a life offreedom be submitted to Paramount under the name of his friend, screen-writer Ian McLellan Hunter. When Paramount subsequently bought the prop-erty for the film’s original director, Frank Capra, Hunter then gave Trumbothe $\$ 50,000$ fee paid by Paramount. Capra, however, proved ill at ease withHunter’s and Trumbo’s politics, and after squabbling with Paramount overthe $\$ 1.5$ million budget, soon departed the film. Gone with him was his ideaof co-starring Cary Grant alongside Elizabeth Taylor.

It was only then that the name of two-time Academy Award–winning dir-ector William Wyler came to the fore. Eager to make a comedy after fifteen

years spent directing dramatic fare ranging from The Little Foxes (1941) toThe Heiress (1949), Wyler sensed that there was a postwar audience hungryfor the film’s charming reverse fairy tale of a story—that of a princess escap-ing royal duties so that she can spend a day in Rome frolicking like an every-day tourist. Once Wyler was hired, Hunter, who had written his own screen-play from Trumbo’s story, left the film, while Wyler, disappointed with ascript submitted by Ben Hecht, next hired the British writer John Dighton toundertake additional revisions.

Given Wyler’s participation, Paramount Pictures remained high on RomanHoliday, particularly if dependable, handsome box office draw Gregory Pecksigned on as the male lead. In future years, Wyler relayed that Peck firstturned down the role, complaining that Princess Ann’s was the best part. SaidWyler: “You surprise me. If you said the picture wasn’t good, okay. But be-cause somebody else’s part is a little better than yours, that’s no reason. Ididn’t think you were that kind of actor.” Peck’s own recall proved to be ut-terly at odds with Wyler’s: “I have no recollection of hesitating at all. Theidea of going to Rome and making a romantic comedy after some of theheavier stuff I’d been doing appealed to me immensely. Even more than that,I liked the idea of working with Willy . . . His sensitivity and artistry were re-cognized. You don’t hesitate—at least I didn’t.”

What was needed to make the fairy tale believable, Wyler thought, was anactress “without an American accent—someone you could believe wasbrought up as a princess”—a young woman capable of projecting a believ-ably aristocratic air while remaining warmly approachable. SomeoneEuropean. To the manner born, yet down to earth. An unknown who couldpull off royal behavior as easily as Roman hijinks and move easily betweendrama, comedy, and a heartfelt unrequited romance. A tall order.

Wyler’s first choice to play the princess, the very British Jean Simmons,proved unavailable when Howard Hughes, who owned the actress’s contract,refused to release her. At this point Richard Mealand, Paramount’s Londonproduction chief, wrote studio headquarters in Hollywood: “I have anothercandidate for Roman Holiday—Audrey Hepburn. I was struck by her playingof a bit-part in Laughter in Paradise.”

When Audrey returned to London for a two-week vacation after the con-clusion of filming Monte Carlo Baby, Wyler, in her words, “met with me fora few minutes to check me out.” However, not wanting to remain in London

to test the five young women being considered for the role of Princess Ann,he assigned the screen tests to another director. Which is where fortunesmiled upon Audrey Hepburn, because William Wyler asked Thorold Dickin-son to direct Audrey’s test, the same Thorold Dickinson who had directedAudrey in Secret People, and with whom she had developed a warm friend-ship.

A test was set for September 18, 1951, at Pinewood Studios, London.Dickinson began the test with a shot of Audrey, her back to the camera,slowly turning around to face forward. She read scenes from the script butseemed to score most strongly with an improvised wink. In later yearsDickinson stated of the wink: “The minute you saw it, you knew she wouldget the part.”

A second scheduled scene required Princess Ann to test the mattress of herbed, but Dickinson kept the camera rolling past his cry of “Cut!” and un-aware that the camera was still running, Audrey giggled and exclaimed: “Oh,is it over now? Oh, good.” Dickinson was so charmed by the moment that heincluded it in the final test reel he sent to Wyler and Paramount executives. InWyler’s slightly different retelling of this pivotal moment, Audrey exclaimed:“How was it? Was I any good?” and when she realized that the camera wasstill running, her spontaneous, laughing reaction to the deception was alsocaptured.

While Audrey’s very accent spoke of European, not American lineage, noone could quite define the origins of that accent, a puzzle which only addedto her allure. Her perfect enunciation seemed to contain more than a hint ofupper-crust British, a bit of continental savoir faire, and yes, perhaps just atouch of American-ese. The very timbre of the voice only added to her ap-peal: low, inviting, occasionally confidential, and capable of climbing up thescale in moments of great emotion. She clearly wasn’t American, yet neverexuded a whiff of European snobbery. It was as if all countries wanted toclaim her—and none could.

As it turned out, Dickinson’s biggest concern was fulfilling Paramount’srequest that he film Audrey talking about herself; while Audrey changed backinto her own clothes, he loaded the camera with a thousand feet of film, andwhen she returned, under gentle prodding, she began talking about her lifeunder the horrors of Nazi occupation. In Audrey’s words: “Talking toThorold, I forgot about the camera.”

In later years, Audrey herself downplayed this conversation, claiming: “Iwas so green I didn’t really know what to do, and I think Thorold got a littledesperate.” Legend has it that when viewing the test footage in Rome,grizzled veteran Wyler was immediately smitten: “Acting, looks, and person-ality! She was absolutely enchanting, and we said, ‘That’s the girl!’” In real-ity, however, Wyler’s wife Talli related that while the director was “very in-trigued” by Audrey, he still wanted to test Suzanne Cloutier as well, cablingParamount: “Please tell Dickinson he did an excellent job. I would like verymuch to see Suzanne Cloutier tested exactly the same way, however—wouldgive us an excellent opportunity to compare the two girls.”

Ironically, in Audrey’s own somewhat startling retelling, Wyler was farfrom completely sold on her: “I remember him saying to me he wasn’t allthat keen. He said, ‘I thought you were a bit fat.’ Which was absolutely true. Iate everything in sight, having been undernourished during the war. Youknow, whole boxes of chocolates. I was ten pounds more than I ever weighedin my life.” Her eating, in fact, was not limited only to chocolates: “When thewar was over and rations started pouring in I started to eat. By the time I was20 I was tubby. I used to eat my way through whole pots of jam.” Musingabout that atypical bit of eating, Audrey smiled: “It’s funny to think I mightnot have gotten the part because I was too fat, because from then on every-body thought I was too thin.”

In truth, even a clod, let alone the great Wyler, could see that as with alltrue movie stars, the camera loved Audrey. She photographed beautifully,with light hitting her sculpted cheekbones and her seemingly translucent eyesflashing with life. The eyes that in real life allowed her to make an immediateconnection with others registered just as vitally on film. Conflicting emotionsdarted across those eyes, because underneath the effortlessly charming exter-ior lay a genuine if muted sadness.

The nose and nostrils may have looked a bit large and the teeth slightlycrooked, but they blended beautifully into a package of endlessly interestingcontrasts. In later years, one of Audrey’s favorite cinematographers, FranzPlaner (Roman Holiday, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, The Nun’s Story, The Unfor-given) would smartly remark that her supposed faults were precisely whatmade Audrey a star: “Thick eyebrows, uneven teeth. She doesn’t mind if herhair is disheveled or if she falls into a pot of soup. She is a real girl.”

All of which meant that in the end, there really was no other choice for the

role of Princess Ann. Yes, Wyler did describe Audrey as a bit “self-con-scious,” but at the same time, in a distinctly un-Wyler-like phrase, he foundher “absolutely delicious.”

Over the decades, the myth has sprung up that upon viewing the test foot-age, Paramount instantly capitulated and offered Audrey the role. In truth,Paramount struck a deal only after Gigi opened in November of 1951 andAudrey became the toast of Broadway. Stardom on Broadway reassuredParamount that Audrey could not only act but also connect directly with anaudience. Wyler was happy, Gregory Peck, who had approval of his leadinglady, was just as happy, and the part of Princess Ann was now officiallyAudrey’s. She was thrilled, and characteristically, genuinely frightened:“Lord, help me live up to all of this.”

A deal was struck: $\$ 12,500$ for twelve weeks of work. Per diem expensesof no more than $\$ 250$ per week. It was a respectable deal for a relatively un-known actress, but by way of contrast, Gregory Peck received a salary of$100,000, as well as $\$ 1,000$ per week in expenses. The disparity in the dealsmade eminent Hollywood sense: Roman Holiday was Peck’s twentieth film,and with several Academy Award nominations already under his belt, he wasconsidered the film’s box office draw.

Much of the film would be shot on location in Rome, a state of affairs thatwas still enough of a novelty in 1952 that the credits actually trumpeted thefact that “Roman Holiday was filmed on location in Rome.” Audrey felt athome in Rome and loved staying at the luxurious Hassler Roma Hotel thatfigured in a less well-reported instance of the Hepburn legend; such was theunimpeachable character of the fledgling star that at the end of filming Ro-man Holiday, when she was contractually required to give Paramount a com-plete report of her daily expenses, she returned the unspent portion of her perdiem. Safe to assume, that action has never been repeated by another star, andParamount, smartly, had the good grace not to accept Audrey’s check.

Rome enchanted Audrey, but shooting in the city proper proved difficultin the extreme. The Eternal City remained consistently noisy, with both ex-uberant natives and thousands of tourists filling the streets and cloggingtraffic, no matter the time of day or night. Wyler had not previously under-taken much location work, let alone in a city as chaotic as Rome, and theautocratic director, used to the perfectly controlled environs of a Hollywoodsoundstage, encountered a steep learning curve. Certainly, he had never pre-

viously faced the sort of wardrobe and hair malfunctions caused by the in-tense Roman summer heat that melted the actors’ makeup. Said Audrey:“Now I know what it’s like to be a star—it’s warmer, more uncomfortable,and the hours are longer.”

Problems and all, Rome itself was emerging as the third star of the film:the ancient ruins, the Pantheon, the Castel San Angel, Barberini Palazzi—itall added up to the perfect setting for a movie that is, when all is said anddone, more about discovering the world than it is about falling in love. It is abright film in both tone and look, and the many outdoor scenes unfoldingthroughout Rome help the transformation of Princess Ann seem even biggerand brighter—the world is opening up right before her eyes.

Audrey seemed to fit the role of Princess Ann smoothly from day one, andit quickly became apparent that the combination of her European sophistica-tion and curiously winning naivete fit the role far more comfortably thanwould have proved the case with an American actress. The outlandish butcagey fashion maven Diana Vreeland understood that naivete perfectly:“She’s a darling girl, enchanting, just adorable. If she loves a friend, sheloves like a child. She’s not at all worldly.”

Playing the European “Princess Ann”—the character’s country of origin isnever specified—Hepburn’s regal bearing was inescapable. When that graceof movement was combined with the genuine interest in others that hermother insisted proved the essence of good manners, Audrey appeared to beof the same—no, more rarified—lineage as any member of real-life Europeannobility. Said Sean after his mother’s death: “I never saw anyone misbehavein her presence in social situations. She always gave you the sense that therewere boundaries that were not to be crossed. I remember hearing that, uponmeeting her, Britain’s Queen Mother murmured, ‘She is one of us.’”

When, early in the film, Princess Ann is referred to as “Her Royal High-ness,” Audrey’s bearing makes anyone and everyone believe she is a queen inwaiting. Lines that would sound laughable if delivered by many stars of the1950s—“That will be all, Countess. Thank you”—come across as quintessen-tially blue-blooded and understanding in Hepburn’s mid-Atlantic purr.Audrey, like Princess Ann, looked innocent but proved wise beyond heryears; character and actress alike remained elusive, which only intriguedaudiences all the more.

It was the film’s rather unexpected take on a fairy-tale myth that further

endeared Roman Holiday and Audrey to audiences: here was a big-screenCinderella undergoing a reverse journey from princess to commoner beforesadly returning to life as a princess. This particular Cinderella’s ball was notanother formal royal gala but was instead found in the freedom to dance on ahouseboat and wander through Rome like thousands of other footloose tour-ists.

Audrey did not have a reservoir of acting technique to fall back upon, butWyler’s direction to just exist in the moment, to avoid “acting,” resonatedwith her. His well-documented penchant for dozens of takes actually helpedAudrey relax, making her feel secure in the knowledge that if she made mis-takes, she would have additional chances to perfect a scene. Under Wyler’stutelage, she inherently understood that she should never play to the camera,but instead, dig within herself to convey the required emotion: her childhoodsense of abandonment, the will of iron demanded by the world of ballet, andeven the instinctive good manners—these all constituted elements thatAudrey could and did readily access. Asked in later years what she hadlearned from Wyler, Audrey replied with feeling: “Almost everything. His at-titude was that only simplicity and the truth count. It has to come from the in-side. You can’t fake it. That is something I long remembered.”

Decades later, her admiration remained just as strong: “He was so dear tome. He never made me feel he had to teach me anything. He just said goahead and do it. Therefore, I felt very relaxed. . . . I was never aware of beingput through my paces or that what I did wasn’t good enough. He’d say,‘Well, let’s just do it again.’” Speaking of her great fortune in filming herfirst two starring roles under the direction of Wyler and Billy Wilder, she ex-plained: “These directors realized there was enough there for them to drawout. I never really became an actress. I never did the repertoire in the theatre .. .”

Only once did Wyler become upset with his leading lady. When the Prin-cess realizes that adherence to duty must trump any romance with Joe Brad-ley, the American newspaperman with whom she has shared her day of free-dom, she is devastated. Try as she might, however, Audrey could not cry oncue, and after multiple ruined takes, Wyler finally yelled: “We can’t stay hereall night. Can’t you cry, for God’s sake?” Audrey was so upset over beingyelled at, so unaccustomed to the harsh words which reminded her of parentalarguments, that she burst into tears. Said co-star Peck: “It was embarrassing

and frightened her and shook her up, but she did it perfectly the very nexttime. On screen it looked like it was because she was parting from me, butactually it was because Wyler had just scared the wits out of her.”

As it turned out, Peck had his own issues with Wyler about farewell tears;tapping into the emotions at play in the scene, Peck’s tears began coursingdown his cheeks, only to have Wyler insist: “No, Greg, don’t get upset. Getangry! Angry! Angry!” Following Wyler’s instructions, Peck played thescene with a sense of anger that he would never see Princess Ann again, ulti-mately relaying to his friend Roger Moore that the entire incident constituted“one of the defining moments of his career . . . he realized just how importantlistening to a director like Wyler could be.” Peck, in fact, remained a big fanof his director: “Willy sensed the interplay between actors. There’s a wholeparade of moments, with nuances and subtexts . . . it’s why so many actorswon Oscars with Willy, because he recognized the moments that broughtthem alive on the screen.”

In this first starring role, Audrey manages the not inconsiderable trick ofappealing to men and women alike, and when she wakes up in Joe’s apart-ment after her night on the town, she exudes innocence tinged with more thana hint of sensuality. This is one princess who looks as sensational in JoeBradley’s pajamas and robe as she does in a ball gown and tiara. It’s no won-der the hardened reporter smilingly tells her: “You should always wear myclothes.”

In fact, if clothes make the man, then in the case of Audrey Hepburn,clothes made the superstar. Combining the height and waistline of a modelwith the legs and rear end of a ballet dancer, Audrey’s ultra-sleek build en-abled her to move on film with a dancer’s grace, lightly skimming the surfaceof the ground as she walked. She was, it was already clear, a clotheshorse parexcellence.

Her ability to make this instantaneous impact was greatly enhanced bothby landing at Paramount, the most style-conscious of the major studios, andby working with the formidable Edith Head, the studio’s leading designer.The very first meeting between Edith and Audrey had taken place near theend of Gigi’s run on Broadway, and it was Head who decided to use clothingto deliberately broaden Audrey’s shoulders, thereby minimizing any concernsover her rather square jaw. In order to camouflage Audrey’s neck and collar-bone, jewelry and scarves were utilized as accessories, and it was quickly de-

cided that because of her ultra-slim physique, Audrey should not be photo-graphed in sleeveless blouses.

Head quickly recognized Audrey’s unique sense of fashion, and over timegrudgingly came to appreciate not only her charm and grace but also her willof iron. Audrey may have been young, but with her innate sense of style shewas able to stand up to Head, politely insisting upon thicker belts not just forthe long, full-flared skirt she would wear throughout much of the film butalso for all of her onscreen dresses (excepting the white and silver brocadeformal gown).

Edith Head, queen of Hollywood costume design, was not used to havingher dictums challenged, and there’s more than a hint of irritation in her recol-lection of meeting with Audrey to discuss Roman Holiday: “[She] had the as-surance of a veteran. She would laugh and curl up on the floor . . . and thenshe would say, with a sweetness that cut like a knife to the heart of the prob-lem, ‘I don’t think the princess would be quite so shrewd, Edith darling, as touse that particular décolletage!’ And I would think, ‘Oh, my God, if shedoesn’t get to the top I’ll eat Hedda Hopper’s hats!’” Just to make sure noone missed the point, Head not so casually added that fittings with Audreywere “of the ten hour, not ten minute, kind.”

In the designer’s own words: “What I liked best about her is that she cal-culated all her business decisions, but made it look as if she didn’t have aclue.” The winner of eight Oscars for best costume design had, it seemed,little chance against the firm opinion and charm offensive of a twenty-two-year-old actress with a whim of iron. In the words of Head: “Audrey knowsmore about fashion than any actress save Dietrich.”

Head had proven herself a past master of calculated studio politicking inservice of her own position, but the difference between the methods of thetwo women lay in the fact that Head could never make it look as if she didn’thave a clue. Which is not to say that Head was immune to Audrey’s charms;writer-director Nora Ephron once related the story that when she visited EdithHead’s fitting room with its famed thirty-six panels of mirror (one for everyten degrees), Head told her that only one person ever looked good in allthirty-six mirrors—Audrey Hepburn. In the designer’s words: “Audrey wasthe perfect figure model: very slim and tall— $5 ^ { \prime } 6 \% ^ { \prime \prime }$ .”

Audrey’s strong sense of self meant that she felt comfortable expressingher opinions to the crusty Head, but at the same time, surrounded as she was

by the best of golden age Hollywood craftsmen and women, she also listenedand followed advice. The look of those almond-shaped eyes that stared out atthe world with intelligence and curiosity? It all came courtesy of Alberto DeRossi, whose wife Grazia served as Audrey’s hair designer. One look atAudrey’s eyes onscreen and women instantly wondered, “What was thetrick?” Could they have “Audrey Hepburn eyes” of their own? The answerwas yes—with a lot of time and patience. Alberto, it turned out, first appliedmascara, and then separated each individual eyelash with a safety pin. Eye-liner was applied on the top lid only, while eyebrows remained thick andstyled upward.

Alberto also played a key role in de-emphasizing Audrey’s somewhatsquare jaw. Said the designer: “In a sense I reversed her face by emphasizingher temples. Except for that, she has such beautiful bone structure that herfeatures need very little shading.”

Paramount executives viewing the dailies were more than happy—in factnearly entranced if such hard-boiled characters were ever capable of enthusi-asm. Audrey Hepburn seemed to glow on film, and while part of that was herown natural intelligence and beauty, credit was again due to Alberto DeRossi. He would clean her face with soap and water, apply foundation andpowder, spray on water for just a few minutes and then blot it all carefullybefore she faced the cameras. The result appeared minimalistic compared tothe pancake-heavy makeup styles so prevalent during the 1940s, and it’s akey reason why Audrey’s look and style remain appealing to twenty-first-century audiences; like Ingrid Bergman’s rather timeless hairstyle in Casab-lanca — no 1940s upswept pompadour in sight—Audrey’s aesthetic belongsto no single decade.

So completely did Audrey come to rely upon Alberto that in the recall ofSean Ferrer: “I remember her saying when he died, crying as though she hadlost a brother, that she would rather not work again. I have sweet memoriesof going to the soccer games with him. Grazia still lives in a beautiful areaoutside Rome, and I consider her a member of my family.” In fact, when Al-berto died, Audrey was so distraught that her then husband Andrea Dotti de-clared that her mourning was out of proportion to the event itself, criticizingher behavior in what can, with hindsight, easily be read as another sign of anunraveling marriage.

Feeling protected by Wyler, cinematographer Planer (who, after falling ill,

was replaced by Henri Alekan), De Rossi, Grazia, and even Edith Head,Audrey relaxed, delivering a performance of great natural charm. By turnswistful and determined, her eyes convey the excitement of Anne’s dual exist-ence as princess and commoner. With her slight physique, Audrey reads on-screen as vulnerable and physically frail, and yet audiences still felt that shecould and would take care of herself.

Roman Holiday, however, remains far from a one-woman show, and notenough has been said about why the chemistry between Hepburn andGregory Peck reads as so natural and unforced. The biggest reason is simple:Hepburn relaxes the sometimes overly stiff Peck. There is a lightness to hisperformance in the film which is often absent in his Mount Rushmore ArrowCollar Man portrayals. He is utterly at ease with Audrey, and the result wasone of his very best turns. That onscreen chemistry carried over off set aswell, and there were rumors that the two stars were personally involved. Inlater years Audrey addressed the issue with characteristic delicacy: “If therewas anything going on, it didn’t last long because most of our time was takenup with work. It’s true that I had an enormous crush on him. But I was en-gaged at the time, and I even had my wedding gown hanging in the wardrobeof my Roman hotel room. And Greg was married to Greta. I knew that hewasn’t happy, that his marriage was not good. . . . Maybe he did feel some-thing for me, maybe there was a little chemistry between us that made ourscenes work. I was in Rome, being treated like a princess, and it was not dif-ficult for me to believe I was the princess in the film, and it was not difficultfor me to believe I was in love with Gregory Peck.”

Enthusing further, she added: “Greg . . . was the gentlest person I’d everknown, and he never made me feel self-conscious.” The feelings were recip-rocated, and in later years Peck referred to his time with Audrey with a grace-ful compliment: “It was my good luck, during that wonderful summer inRome, to be the first of her screen fellows, to hold out my hand, and help herkeep her balance as she did her spins and pirouettes.” He continued: “Every-one on the set of Roman Holiday was in love with Audrey. We did that onepicture together, and I think it was the happiest experience I ever had on amovie set.”

So relaxed was Peck that it was he who conspired with Wyler to surpriseAudrey with an improvised piece of slapstick at the ancient “Mouth ofTruth.” As Joe Bradley whisks Princess Ann on a whirlwind tour of Rome,

they stop at the famous monument with its open gargoyle mouth. When Peckstuck his hand inside the mouth, he pushed his hand up his sleeve so thatwhen he displayed it to Hepburn it looked chopped off, causing her to let outa scream of genuine surprise—she had no idea that the duo had cooked upthis inspired piece of business. Laughed Audrey: “It was the only sceneWyler ever did in one take.”

Besides the charm of the Hepburn-Peck team, Roman Holiday scores withaudiences by conveying an infectious spirit of release. Gone are the stuffyrituals of Princess Ann’s court life, replaced by impulse and whimsy in a cel-ebration of change. The film’s most famous scene of transformation occurswhen, on the spur of the moment, Princess Ann has her long hair cut off in anItalian barber shop. The barber is uncertain as to the wisdom of such a move,but the princess is insistent, and it is at this moment, right before the viewer’seyes, that the Audrey Hepburn look is born on film. When the movie was re-leased in 1953, young women all over the world not only made mental noteof Audrey’s sleek, short hairstyle but responded viscerally to the sight of ayoung woman taking charge of her own life. As Princess Ann breaks out ofher ossified court life, her smile widens in delight, and that million-dollarsmile, the one Audrey felt showed her crooked teeth, made goners of menand women alike.

By the end of the film, even though the audience has spent two hours root-ing for the princess to enjoy her freedom, that same audience understands thenecessity of the sorry-grateful conclusion; a newspaperman and a princesscan never stay together because in Princess Ann’s world, duty trumps all.There is no happy ending to this tale of mismatched lovers, but as Paramountstudio executive A. C. Lyles enthused: “Audrey had it in her to be the sugarcoating on a bad-tasting pill.”

With its rueful and bittersweet romance, Roman Holiday was setting thetemplate for a key component of the Audrey Hepburn filmography: romanticattraction trumps physical passion. Apart from Two for the Road, physical ex-pression and sexuality are kept to a minimum in all her major films, replacedinstead by romantic yearning, preferably expressed while dressed in thehighest of fashions.

It was Princess Ann’s yearning that drove the film, so when the Paramountpublicity machine went into overdrive ahead of Roman Holiday’s August 27,1953, release, it made a certain kind of sense that the relatively unknown

Audrey Hepburn was billed above the title in the boldest of letters: “GregoryPeck—Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday.” And yet—how had Audrey se-cured above-the-title billing alongside a certified movie star like GregoryPeck? Was her agent really that good?

The story of Audrey’s billing almost immediately became a part of herCinderella story, with a widely repeated story making the rounds thatGregory Peck himself insisted upon the billing by telling his agent: “The realstar of this picture is Audrey Hepburn. [Tell] the studio I want Audrey Hep-burn to be billed on the same line.” In reality, gentlemanly as Peck was, theproduction files for Roman Holiday show that it was Wyler and the studiopersonnel at Paramount who had the idea of billing Audrey above the titlealongside Peck, although “they realized this was a delicate matter because ofthe actor’s contract.” Peck was approached and quickly agreed to the change.In her first starring role, Audrey Hepburn was now billed above the title, rightalongside a bona fide movie star.

As the final edit of Roman Holiday was locked in, word began circulatingon the Paramount lot that this new Hepburn might just prove to be as memor-able and downright unique as the older, equally patrician Katharine Hepburn.The publicity buildup began, at which point Audrey Hepburn did somethingvery unusual for a contract actress in the studio system days: she stood up tothe studio brass. In an era when names, background, and appearance werestill routinely invented by the studios, Arthur Wilde, the Paramount publicistassigned to build up Hepburn and Roman Holiday, had informed her thatgiven her rather flat-chested appearance, the studio might ask her to wearfalsies. Her answer? Nothing doing. “She was adamant that she would changenothing in her appearance—she would be herself or no one at all.” Her in-stincts were, as so often proved to be the case, correct, and after her untimelydeath, the New York Times eulogized: “What a burden she lifted from wo-men. There was proof that looking good need not be synonymous with look-ing bimbo. Thanks to their first glimpse of Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holi-day, half a generation of young females stopped stuffing their bras and teeter-ing on stiletto heels.”

She then refused a second studio request, emphatically rejecting the sug-gestion that she ditch the surname of Hepburn in order to avoid confusionwith Katharine. Drawing a contrast between the two Hepburns, film historianJeanine Basinger explains: “For quite a while, especially at the beginning,

there were many people who did not like Katharine Hepburn—they found hertoo brittle. She’s an exterior actress, unlike Audrey. But the biggest differ-ence is that everyone loved Audrey right from the start.” If, during the RedScare, Lillian Hellman would not “cut her conscience to fit the standards ofthe day,” then Audrey would not cut out the most essential part of herself—her name.

When Roman Holiday opened at Radio City Music Hall, the acclaimproved immediate both for the film and for Audrey. Bosley Crowther of theNew York Times, who was to remain Audrey’s biggest cheerleader through-out his tenure at the paper, described her as “alternately regal and childlike . .. Hepburn is the discovery of the decade.” Who cared that Roman Holiday’sstory could be called contrived? It was, in the words of A. H. Weiler of theNew York Times, a “bittersweet legend with laughs that leave the spirits soar-ing.”

In an era when the cover of Time magazine meant a great deal, Audreyfound herself in that sought after position a mere four days after the filmopened, with the story inside toasting her in glowing terms worthy of theHollywood star machine at its best: “Amid the rhinestone glitter of RomanHoliday’s make-believe, Paramount’s new star sparkles and glows with thefire of a newly cut diamond.” Then U.S. senator John F. Kennedy pro-nounced it his favorite film, and as revealed by William Wyler’s biographerJan Herman, during the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis, it was RomanHoliday that President Kennedy requested be screened at the White Housewhile awaiting the Soviet Union’s response. The president watched the movieon October 27, the day before the Soviets agreed to remove their missilesfrom Cuba.

Jeanine Basinger points out that Audrey’s explosive impact was a particu-larly American phenomenon; people in the UK and Europe had gained agradual familiarity with the star through her turns in Lavender Hill Mob,Monte Carlo Baby, and Secret People, but in the United States, “when youare introduced in a high-quality film like Roman Holiday, starring withGregory Peck and directed by William Wyler, people notice. And this filmwould not have been the same with anyone else. You could take the samescript, production design and location work but it’s Audrey that elevated it.She was so distinct in her look and dress. You can’t locate her exact personal-ity, so you remain intrigued. She was ‘the other’ and yet seemed real. She

wasn’t an alien being—she was completely and totally fresh. And—an excep-tional talent. She’s very, very good, and perfectly cast as a young princess.”

With Roman Holiday’s critical acclaim matched by its box office success,it was no surprise that the film garnered ten Academy Award nominations:Best Picture, Director, Actress, Supporting Actor (Eddie Albert), Cinemato-graphy Black and White (Franz Planer), Best Adapted Screenplay (IanMcLellan Hunter), Art Direction Black and White (Hal Pereira), and FilmEditing (Robert Swink).

Roman Holiday may have lost the Best Picture award to From Here toEternity, but it won for Best Costume Design, Black and White (Edith Head)and Best Writing, Original Motion Picture Story. Dalton Trumbo, however,still a figure of suspicion, proved to be persona non grata at the AcademyAwards. Instead, Roman Holiday’s award for Best Story was “won” by JohnDighton and Ian McLellan Hunter (the duo was also nominated for BestScreenplay, losing to Daniel Taradash for From Here to Eternity), and it tookanother forty years before the deceased Trumbo’s rightful Oscar was presen-ted to his children and widow Cleo. In Ian Hunter’s recall: “I was given anAcademy Award for a story that was clearly not mine. Had it [the award]been for the screenplay, I could have convinced myself that I had done mostof it.”

Unlike Trumbo, Audrey was very much in evidence on Oscar night ofMarch 25, 1954, but in New York City, where she was starring in the Broad-way production of Ondine. After scoring wins as Best Actress with the NewYork Film Critics Circle, the Golden Globes, and the British Academy ofFilm and Television Arts (BAFTA), Audrey was considered one of the favor-ites for the Academy Award but remained too busy with Ondine to obsessover the idea of winning an Oscar. No one expected Maggie McNamara towin for The Moon Is Blue, with the film’s most notable contribution to filmhistory lying in its status as the first mainstream Hollywood film to utilize theword “virgin.” Ava Gardner cared little about either Hollywood or winningfor Mogambo, and Leslie Caron’s performance in Lili was charming, but thefilm considered a trifle. No, Audrey’s real competition lay with Deborah Kerrfor her unexpected turn as an adulterous wife in From Here to Eternity.

As the telecast entered its third hour, the list of nominees for Best Actresswas read by Gary Cooper from a location shoot in Mexico. In a move certainto torture the five nominated actresses, he did not then read the name of the

winner and instead turned the telecast back over to Hollywood host DonaldO’Connor. O’Connor joked about not reading out the winner’s name, beforefinally exclaiming: “In New York, Miss Audrey Hepburn for Roman Holi-day!” Seated in the NBC Century Theatre, Audrey bounded out of her seatand up to the stage, and in her excitement immediately exited stage right in-stead of accepting her award. Her winningly innocent move having furtherendeared her to everyone in the theatre and the tens of millions watching athome, she then crossed to center stage in a white Givenchy gown adornedwith appliqued flowers, a dress so flattering that in 1995, two years after herdeath, Time magazine voted it “the best Oscar dress of all time.”

A beaming Audrey received her Oscar from producer Jean Hersholt, keep-ing her speech to a bare minimum and simply proclaiming: “It’s too much. Iwant to say thank you to everybody who these past months and years havehelped, guided, and given so much. I’m truly, truly, grateful, and terriblyhappy.”

Her entire life had just changed, and yet somehow, she herself never did.In the words of British ballerina Darcey Bussell: “She was always very real,one of those natural stars who never tried to be anything other than who shewas. It’s hard to stay true to yourself and it’s rare, especially today.”

Audrey’s own reaction to her newly found top-of-the-world public per-sona? “It’s easier to be a shy dancer than a shy actress.”

# Chapter TenRIGHT GIRL, RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME—the1950s

“With her skinny waist, short hair, and thick eyebrows, she single-handedly changed the way leading ladies looked in Hollywood.”

—medium.com

AS THE IMMEDIATE ACCLAIM FOR Roman Holiday made clear, Audrey had provento be the right girl, in the right place, at the right time, the beneficiary of ar-riving on the scene while the Hollywood studio system still retained power.By signing her contract with Paramount Pictures, she was now receiving abuildup from a phalanx of studio publicists toiling to put her decidedly un-changed name in front of the public. And when that publicity machine wentinto high gear, the press agents were delighted to find that the general popula-tion was genuinely interested in the Hepburn story, from her years aiding theunderground to her discovery by Colette. When combined with a flair forfashion that instantly struck a chord, she began to be promoted not as a sexsymbol but as a star with whom other women could identify.

Just like Jean Simmons, Audrey registered as the antidote to the beautifulbut blatantly sexual personae of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. Wo-men could never see themselves wearing a startling white halter dress whilestanding over a subway grate like Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch,but Audrey, dark haired, flat chested, and gazellelike in movement, seemedwithin reach—utterly approachable, aristocratic bearing and all. Right thereon the thirty-foot silver screen, gamboling about Rome, was a comfortingsymbol for girls who had not yet grown into women; for those not ready tothink of themselves as sexual beings, Audrey presented a warm, nonthreaten-ing image.

America, indeed, the world, was ready for the new type of postwar womanAudrey represented. Her very background, in fact, proved to be an essentialpart of her appeal to the many Americans longing for a brand of Europeansophistication rather than American WASP hauteur. Her intriguing personaseemed a bundle of contradictions straight out of a fairy tale: The daughter ofa baroness, yet a woman who seemed to want no part of the aristocracy.Tomboyish yet utterly feminine. A ballerina by training who forsook the rari-fied world of ballet for musical theatre and Hollywood. A beauty with thebearing of a model, but one who remained friendly to all.

She now seemed to be everywhere at once, her influence ranging fromhaute couture—she displayed the perfect silhouetted figure for Dior’s NewLook—to animation, with Disney Studios animator Tom Oreb reportedlybasing his original 1959 conception sketch for Sleeping Beauty’s PrincessAurora on Audrey. Her chic was even said to influence Maria Callas, withsome commentators definitively stating that it was after seeing Roman Holi-day that Callas decided to transform herself from a stereotypically overweightopera diva into a slim, ultra-chic jet-setter.

Audiences who connected more deeply with Gregory Peck’s personawhen the interesting cracks behind the handsome exterior were exposed infilms like 12 O’Clock High similarly seemed to grasp the near palpable sad-ness underneath Audrey’s beautiful exterior. Thin to the point of audienceconcern, Audrey was still somehow strong enough to hoist those concernsonto her own shoulders and run with the audience’s trust. Hers was a resolutespirit neither as overtly determined as Katharine Hepburn’s nor as desperateas Joan Crawford’s. She dealt with setbacks by never giving up, striking anote of delicacy alongside the inner strength, and proving altogether uniquein her postwar ability to inspire hope. Among post–World War II stars, onlyDoris Day inspired a similar, much more American, and down-to-earth belief.

Audrey’s European sensibility was, in all ways, the antithesis of the hardsell, and if Doris Day was in the process of establishing herself as 1950sAmerica’s favorite girl next door, then Audrey Hepburn was securing a placeas the princess next door. Said shrewd observer Cecil Beaton, ten years be-fore he and Audrey were to work together so memorably on My Fair Lady:“It took the rubble of Belgium, an English accent, and an American successto launch the striking personality that best exemplifies our new zeitgeist.”

It all seemed new—and irresistible to men and women alike. Regal bear-

ing and all, underneath that voice and perfect posture was a woman who stillseemed like a whole lot of fun. She was, as Peck characterized her, “wackyand funny, a very lovable girl who was always making faces and doing back-flips and clowning around”—“a sophisticated elf.” Even in Roman Holiday,her own sense of humor about herself and others, an acknowledgment of theuniversal foibles that make up a major part of the human condition, readbeautifully onscreen. As her final life partner Robert Wolders put it in lateryears: “Her sense of appropriateness and decorum was happily mixed with asense of irony and humor—not taking herself too seriously, but seriouslyenough.”

Audrey Hepburn, it seemed, could do no wrong.

Yet.

# Chapter ElevenA FIRST LOVE, 1950–1952

“For a year I thought it possible to make our combined lives and careerswork out . . .”

—Audrey Hepburn

ON THE MISGUIDED 2000 TELEVISION movie The Audrey Hepburn Story, fifthbilling had been granted to Peter Giles in the role of “James Hanson.” Theactors and characters billed above Giles were recognizable to any devotees ofAudrey’s life story: Frances Fisher as Ella van Heemstra, Keir Dullea playingJoseph Ruston, and Gabriel Macht in the role of William Holden. But whoexactly was James Hanson? The short answer: a very successful businessmanwho almost landed a real-life role as the first Mr. Audrey Hepburn.

It was in the summer of 1950, soon after completing her role in The Lav-ender Hill Mob, that Audrey first met James Hanson. Seven years older thanthe twenty-one-year-old Audrey, Hanson, a handsome six-foot, four-inchman about town, was the scion of a Huddersfield, Yorkshire, family that hadmade a sizable fortune in the trucking industry. The Hanson money was seri-ous: not just comfortable, not just millionaire-level serious, but rather, as onecommentator had it, “net worth . . . in the tens of millions of pounds sterling.”

Decades down the line, Hanson would become Lord Hanson, the chair ofHanson PLC, a “17 billion dollar global conglomerate,” but for now he was arich, impeccably mannered playboy who fell hard for Audrey. In his decades-later assessment: “Everybody saw in her this wonderful life and brightnessand terrific strength of character.” Hanson, in fact, met and charmed the for-midable Ella, and contrary to reports, he reported that Baroness van Heemstra“thought we were well suited.”

The charming and good-looking duo fell in love and were noticed about

London: Beauty and the Handsome Rich Man. It all played out as a story-book romance, with an engagement and announcement in the “ForthcomingMarriages” column of the London Times following on December 4, 1951.Hanson was listed as the son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hanson of NorwoodGrange, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, while Audrey appeared in print as the“daughter of Baroness Ella van Heemstra, of 65 South Audley Street, Lon-don, W.1.” The name of James Ruston was nowhere to be found.

So far, so good. The Fontana sisters, highly acclaimed designers based inRome, created the wedding dress of Audrey’s dreams, an elegant, streamlinedconfection of ivory silk with a bow underneath the bust; given Audrey’s ever-increasing public profile, a photo of her in that gown appeared in papers wellbefore the wedding. Two hundred guests received invitations to the event atHuddersfield, where there would be flowers, champagne, and music. Withthe war finally in the rearview mirror, life was returning to normal. Or as nor-mal as a wedding between a multimillionaire and a new Broadway star couldbe.

But . . .

Busy with Gigi and the proposed filming of Roman Holiday, Audreyfound it increasingly difficult to find time alone for and with Hanson. Visitorsto her backstage dressing room at the Fulton Theatre noticed that Audreyspoke less and less of her fiancé—and soon realized that his photo had disap-peared from her dressing room. Nothing to be concerned about, explainedAudrey; she simply felt the photo was too public a display of affection forwhat she deemed a private matter of the heart. But, it started to seem like theromance was unraveling, and no one was exactly shocked when, duringGigi’s road tour, a printed cancellation card was issued which read: “Baron-ess Ella van Heemstra much regrets to announce that the wedding of herdaughter Audrey Hepburn to James Hanson, arranged to take place on $3 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$September, 1952, at Huddersfield Parish Church, is unavoidably postponedand will take place in New York later this year.” It was all adding up to a ro-mantic misfire, and shortly thereafter, halfway through the eight-month tourof Gigi, the London Times matrimonial column officially announced: “Theengagement between Mr. James Hanson and Miss Audrey Hepburn has beenbroken.”

Uncharacteristically, Audrey spoke with the New York Daily News in

November of 1952 about this private matter: “Jimmy and I talked it over twoweeks ago, and we decided we weren’t made for each other. When I’m mar-ried I want to be very much married. I want people to look at me and knowthey never need ask, ‘Were you ever married?’ . . . We agreed to break thingsoff—it was mutual.” Hanson’s discreet comment: “Our work kept us apartmore and more.” Audrey, who throughout her life could display a surpris-ingly practical bent, bluntly stated: “When I found out that I didn’t even havetime to attend to the furnishing of our London flat, I suddenly knew I wouldmake a pretty bad wife. I would forever have to be studying parts, fitting cos-tumes and giving interviews. What a humiliating spot to put my husband in—making him stand by, holding my coat while I signed autographs.”

Decades later, and in his nineties, Hanson allowed as how the decision tocall things off was mutual, recalling that Audrey told him: “‘I really don’tthink I want to get married at this time. I hate to do this to you. I love yourfamily.’ There was disappointment, yes, but there was no rift or rupture, justa natural decision made by both sides.” Indeed, all those decades later, Han-son remained fully on board in terms of Audrey’s career: “Had she marriedme, Audrey would have continued with her career. No doubt about it. I be-lieved in that. There was never any ‘either/or’ marriage/career problem. Shewas somebody whose star and whose destiny had been set by her talent.”

The marriage was off, and the wedding gown given away, with Audreytelling the Fontana sisters to donate the dress: “I want my dress to be worn byanother girl for her wedding, perhaps someone who couldn’t ever afford adress like mine, the most beautiful poor Italian girl you can find.” In the end,the dress was worn by Amiable Altobella at her farm wedding, and when soldat auction in London in 2009 it brought in $\$ 23,000$ . Said Altobella: “I havehad a happy marriage, so the dress brought me luck.”

The friendship between Audrey and Hanson endured through the decades,and when they saw each other again many years later, their mutual affectionremained; unexpectedly meeting at the opening of the Aga Khan’s CostaSmeralda Hotel in Sardinia, Audrey spotted Hanson, who had recently beenknighted, and in his recall, gave him “a little smile and said, ‘Haven’t wedone well!’ That’s how she was, always gracious and fun.” That same graceinformed her relationship with another former beau, millionaire yachtsmanand theatrical producer Michael Butler, with whom she had spent time in theearly 1950s. Said Butler, long after the end of their relationship: “Anything

positive you have heard is not an exaggeration—she was one of the loveliesthuman beings I’ve known in my life—very bright, intelligent, great fun.”

There were to be casual romances post-Hanson, and Audrey occasionallydated an up-and-coming United States senator from Massachusetts by thename of John F. Kennedy. (Some twenty plus years later, another UnitedStates president, Jimmy Carter, declared to Audrey: “I have admired andloved you at a distance.”) But for now, no additional matters of the heartproved serious. Work was all, even if Audrey didn’t necessarily want it thatway. In fact, she definitely did not want it that way, but after her smash debutin Roman Holiday she was the in-demand it girl of the moment. And that mo-ment dictated Sabrina. Humphrey Bogart. Billy Wilder.

And William Holden.

# Chapter TwelveSABRINA, BOGIE, and WILLIAM HOLDEN, 1953–1954

“This girl, singlehanded, will make bosoms a thing of the past.”

—Billy Wilder

ROME, BRUSSELS, AND LONDON SUITED Audrey Hepburn in a way Los Angelesnever could, but looming above every other city in her life was the magicalconnection she felt to Paris, a love affair on film which began with the 1953filming of Sabrina. Yes, this was a Hollywood soundstage version of Paris,unlike the location shooting which would dazzle in Funny Face, but evenhere, Audrey felt at home. For a fashionista who was fluent in French, any it-eration of Paris would do very nicely indeed. It was the idea of Paris whichwould play a key role in this all-important follow-up to Roman Holiday, andif, as Dizzy Gillespie had it, the professional is the guy who can do it twice,then the question at the heart of the matter remained clear: Was Audrey aone-hit wonder, or could lightning strike twice?

The movie’s source material, the play Sabrina Fair by Samuel Taylor, hadopened on Broadway in November 1953, but at Audrey’s urging, Paramount(which had taken over her contract from ABC) had bought rights to the playeven before it opened, in fact before rehearsals had even begun. Billy Wildereventually claimed that he was the one who had asked Paramount to buy therights, but whomever urged Paramount, the director already knew that hewanted to work with Audrey: “We first saw a test that was made with her.She looked like a princess.”

Audrey felt simpatico with this particular Cinderella story as soon as sheread the Wilder–Ernest Lehman–Samuel Taylor screenplay’s very firstwords: “Once upon a time, on the North Shore of Long Island.” The film,

now simply titled Sabrina, would center around the romantic misadventuresof Sabrina, the daughter of a chauffeur working for the wealthy Larrabeefamily. Growing up in love with David Larrabee, the handsome ne’er-do-wellyounger son who barely notices her existence, Sabrina is sent to Paris for“finishing” after an inept suicide attempt fueled by her romantic despair. Un-like her future films Funny Face and My Fair Lady, in which her characterundergoes a transformation initiated by others, here in Sabrina, Audrey’scharacter would oversee the transformation herself, with no man necessary.

Returning to Long Island a polished and poised couture-wearing sophistic-ate, Sabrina, like all true Cinderellas, breaks down barriers while wowing ablack-tie crowd at the Larrabees’ formal dinner dance. The Larrabees repres-ent American royalty, and Sabrina is every inch their equal—it just takes herthe entire film to figure out that she has had the wrong Prince Charming inmind. It’s David’s older brother Linus, a hard-charging, successful businesstycoon, who ultimately proves the one man worthy of Sabrina’s love.

The seemingly ageless Cary Grant seemed a perfect fit to play oppositeAudrey as the straitlaced but ultimately charming Linus. Indeed, even at thisearly stage of Audrey’s career, people had already begun clamoring for apairing with Cary Grant, but at fifty, Grant, always vigilant about his screenimage, thought himself too old for the role; the twenty-five-year age gap withAudrey made him feel more than a little like a dirty old man. The role wasthen offered to the fifty-four-year-old Humphrey Bogart, who not onlylooked a good decade older than Grant, but also had never been celebratedfor his way with romantic comedy. Perhaps attracted by the substantial fee of$300,000, Bogart accepted the role, as did the Academy Award-winning Wil-liam Holden, who, for a fee of $150,000, signed on to play David Larrabee.Audrey’s fee? $15,000.

Sabrina may have been set on the North Shore of Long Island, but thisdaughter of a very British-sounding chauffeur (played by John Williams)seemed to speak with a rather aristocratic mid-Atlantic accent. Where exactlyhad she been raised? She definitely did not sound like a New Yorker, but inthe end no one much cared, because what had always been crystal clear wasthat stardom, allotted to a precious few, made its own rules. Audiences wouldmake all sorts of concessions when it came to their favorite stars, be itAudrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews, with whom Audrey’s life and careerwould soon begin to intersect in all manner of interesting and headline-mak-

ing ways. Julie would ultimately play the title character in 1967’s all-Amer-ican musical Thoroughly Modern Millie, and while her Millie from the heart-land of the USA spoke with an entirely out-of-place crisp English accent, notone person in the audience cared. They just wanted to hear Julie Andrewssing.

Varying accents and all, filming on Sabrina began in September, with loc-ation shooting taking place in Mamaroneck, New York, at the estate ofBarney Balaban, chief of production at Paramount. After additional filmingon Long Island, the most notable set being the swimming pool of CBS chair-man William Paley and his socialite wife Babe, the film returned to Para-mount for two months of interior shooting. Production ended on December 5,eleven days behind schedule, at a total cost of $\$ 2.2$ million.

It was the end of a rather arduous shoot, with Wilder and screenwriterLehman often writing scenes the night before they were to be filmed. Occa-sionally starting the day without enough pages for a full day’s filming, dir-ector Wilder would ask Audrey to help him stall so that he could continuewriting. Approaching Audrey on set he explained: “Look, you have to fumblea line, you have to misread the line. I’m terribly sorry, you have to help me,we cannot shoot more than a page and a half. . . . And she said, ‘I’ll do it.’She said, ‘Oh, I have a terrible headache, let me lie down a bit.’ And then shewas fifteen minutes, an hour, so I just barely ran out of stuff, the page andhalf by six o’clock. . . . She was helping me. . . . She just did it.”

Whether on location in Long Island or back in Hollywood, Audrey Hep-burn had charmed the entire crew, and even the extraordinarily cynicalWilder, survivor of both the Nazis and the Hollywood dream factory, foundhimself happily surrendering to his star: “After so many drive-in waitresses inmovies (it has been a real drought) here is class—somebody who went toschool, can spell, and possibly play the piano. The other class girl is Kathar-ine Hepburn. There is nobody else—just a lot of drive-in waitresses off to theraces, wriggling their behinds at the 3-D camera.” Speaking of Audrey’s dan-cing ability, he rated her: “Great. . . . She was a good everything.”

With Wilder, Audrey immediately formed a lifelong friendship. Her rela-tionship with Bogie? Tricky. Her partnership with Holden? Romantic. In theextreme.

Ahh—William Holden. The uber-handsome leading man of Americancinema who had started out playing the violinist turned boxer in Golden Boy

(1939). Untutored but possessed of a vivid screen presence, Holden had beennurtured by co-star Barbara Stanwyck in that first starring role, and after thefilm’s success, began receiving increasingly important roles. In short order heseemed to corner the market on characters suggesting the dark strains under-neath an all-American exterior, turning in a first-rate performance in Wilder’sbrilliant Sunset Boulevard (1950) and winning an Oscar as a prisoner of warin Stalag 17 (1953). Holden proved masculine enough to appease men whilestill enough of a heartthrob to set female hearts fluttering. On Sabrina, how-ever, it was the married Holden’s heart that took a tumble: one look atAudrey, one heart-to-heart talk in that endearingly intimate way of hers, andthe nine-years-older Holden was a goner. So too, at least for a brief and veryintense period, was Audrey.

The atmosphere proved intoxicating: two stars living in the rarified hot-house of a first-class Hollywood production with every whim catered to in acocoon of intimacy. The rest of the world registered only as an intrusion andthere was talk of Holden leaving his wife and two sons for a life with Audrey.At which point came the one piece of news the child-loving Audrey could notovercome: Holden had undergone a vasectomy and could not father any morechildren. His decision flew directly in the face of Audrey’s deepest desires,because Audrey wanted children far more than she ever wanted a career inHollywood: “The one thing I dreamed of in my life was to have children ofmy own. It always boils down to the same thing. Not only receiving love butwanting desperately to give it . . . almost needing to give it.”

In one telling of the story, Holden blamed his vasectomy on both Audreyand his own drinking: “The constant talk of marriage and babies was gettingon my nerves, so I went out and got a vasectomy—I was half-drunk at thetime. I did it to shut her up talking about babies. Audrey was shocked. Shebroke down and cried and our romance crashed.” She broke off the involve-ment, and any desperate hopes Holden held of rekindling the romance wereforever dashed when she announced her plan to marry Mel Ferrer, announcedit in fact, on the very evening she and Mel were out on a double date withHolden and his wife Ardis. The message was received by a heartbrokenHolden, but not happily. His later comment: “I was in a jealous rage.”

It was not just Holden who was thoroughly smitten with Audrey, however,with her affect causing the most jaded of Hollywood observers to happily ca-pitulate. Said veteran Hollywood photographer Bob Willoughby, on assign-

ment to take still photographs of Audrey for publicity use: “I was talking toBud Fraker, waiting for the arrival of the subject, when out of the dressingroom floated this vision swathed in voile. Bud caught my look of admirationand helped me to close my open mouth.” Willoughby, by then seemingly in-ured to the artifice of Hollywood, was a goner: “She took my hand anddazzled me with a smile that God designed to melt mortal men’s hearts. Shehad a voice filled with smiles.”

Tradition may have held that stars sometimes give gifts to co-stars orfavored members of the crew, but on Sabrina, it was the crew who gaveAudrey a silver box with the inscription: “To Audrey Hepburn. With sincerelove and great admiration from the entire Sabrina Fair crew. Hollywood—1953.” Crew members taking up a collection to give a gift to the star? It’s asunheard of in Hollywood as a star trying to give back part of her per diem . . .

The crew may have loved Audrey, but her relations with Humphrey Bog-art did not always run quite as smoothly. There were rumors of friction, all ofwhich seemed to center around Bogie objecting to Audrey’s style of acting.Asked by Clifton Webb about working with Audrey, Bogie responded:“She’s OK if you like to do 36 takes.” (In later years, Wilder instantly de-bunked an even lower number of supposed takes: “Twenty-six takes? AudreyHepburn? Twenty-six, no. That was Marilyn Monroe, before we could get theline straight.”) In Stephen Bogart’s memoir of his father, he bluntly writes:“Dad also did not care for Audrey Hepburn. Though he said gracious thingsabout her in interviews, he privately thought that she was unprofessional.”The charge is unexpected and seems rather out of place, “professional” beingthe one word repeatedly utilized by Audrey’s colleagues to describe her workethic.

Explaining further, Stephen Bogart writes: “Even on this movie, which hewas unhappy about, Dad knew his lines cold, and he often got impatient withHolden and Hepburn, both of whom had a tendency to blow lines.” GivenAudrey’s thorough daily preparation, it seems a strange charge, but thenagain, Bogart was unhappy on the movie. Upset that he was Wilder’s secondchoice for the role of Linus Larrabee, Bogart, in the recall of his agent PhilGersh, complained vociferously about Wilder: “‘Look, this guy is shootingthe back of my head, I don’t even have to put my hairpiece on; I’m not in thispicture.’” Such was Bogart’s unhappiness that Gersh, in his own recall, “wentto Billy Wilder and told him, ‘Look, Bogie is very unhappy, he’s going to

walk.’”

Bogart did not walk, but in Ernest Lehman’s estimation, there was yet an-other element at play, particularly when Wilder shot the scene of Bogart andAudrey dancing in the indoor tennis court: “What happened in that scene isthat Billy Wilder fell in love with Audrey’s image onscreen.” Director Wilderwanted to present his star at her most beautiful, and if Bogart’s feathers wereruffled in the process, Wilder figured let the chips fall where they may. Eventhe great Bogart, it seemed, could not compete with Audrey at her most beau-tiful.

Audrey in later years dismissed the rumors of friction: “I adored Bogie. Ifhe didn’t like me he certainly never showed it. He had his problems withdrinking.” Any tension between Audrey and Bogart may also have been theresult of his rumored wish that wife Lauren Bacall be hired to play Sabrina,an idea which fortunately went nowhere, it being a noticeable stretch for Bac-all to ever have played an innocent. (Interestingly, Jeanine Basinger pointsout a parallel between Bacall and Audrey: “Like Audrey, Lauren Bacall wasone of the very few others who seemed to appear out of nowhere. She wasnineteen, there had been no prior sightings aside from some modeling pic-tures, and she too was placed with a great male star—Bogart—in a showyrole in The Big Sleep. Bacall with her voice and seen it all look at age nine-teen was also new and different, but at the time she first hit the scene, shedidn’t hit the heights of stardom the way Audrey did, as much as she did inpublicity.”)

As it was, while all those around him praised Audrey, the best Bogie couldmutter was: “With Audrey it’s kind of unpredictable. She’s like a good tennisplayer—she varies her shots.” Pressed further, he managed: “She’s discip-lined, like all those ballet dames.” Bogart’s lukewarm comments are note-worthy because they represent the exception to fulsome praise from co-starsranging from Gregory Peck, William Holden, and Gary Cooper to FredAstaire and Albert Finney. Audrey never did have many detractors—it’s as ifaudience and co-workers alike understood the sincerity of her effort. In thecase of Bogart, part of the tension may simply have resulted from his aware-ness that at thirty years Audrey’s senior, he looked more like her father thanbeau. Tough guy or not, Bogart, like all stars, possessed a finely tuned aware-ness of exactly how old he appeared on screen, and in his canny professional-ism, he was instantly aware of Wilder’s plethora of over-the-shoulder shots

focusing on Audrey’s beautiful, unlined face.

In the end, the relationship between Bogart and Audrey is probably bestsummed up by her comment of later years: “I was rather terrified ofHumphrey Bogart—and he knew it. [But] if he didn’t like me he certainlynever showed it.” Speaking to Robert Wolders, she did characterize the rela-tionship with Bogart as filled with Bogie’s “jovial roughness,” and in typic-ally modest fashion, she told Sean that she and Bogie got along “okay” butthat she sensed he didn’t think a great deal of her as an actress. Loyal sonSean called Bogie’s assessment unfair, at which point, he smilingly recalled,she “looked straight at me and said he probably had reason to.”

In truth the real friction on the set of Sabrina lay between Bogie and BillyWilder. Their collaboration proved to be a clash between two tough, cynicalmen, and although Bogart had begun by making fun of Audrey’s accent, hesoon took to imitating Wilder’s German-accented English, asking bystandersto translate Wilder’s comments into English. Bogart then upped the friction,calling Wilder a “Nazi son of a bitch”—this, jokingly or not, to a man wholost his mother and stepfather at Auschwitz.

Not one to be fazed by an actor, Wilder retorted: “I look at you, Bogie,and beneath the surface of an apparent shit, I see the face of a real shit.”Agent Swifty Lazar characterized the relationship in terms of Bogart’s de-mands: “Bogart thought that a director must humble himself before Bogart.But on a Billy Wilder picture there is no star but Billy Wilder.” It proved nosurprise that the two men never worked together again, and yet decades later,Wilder managed to put the relationship in perspective and achieve a recon-ciliation: “Unfortunately, Bogart knew he was my second choice. All throughthe shooting of Sabrina, he would bring up Cary Grant. He was very mean tome and I was very annoyed with him. For that role, after all, who wouldn’thave wanted Cary Grant? But when Bogart was dying, I went to visit him athis home. He was very brave and, in the end, I forgave him everything andheld him in the highest esteem.” Summing up his star, Wilder explained: “Healways played the hero, but he never was . . . until the end.”

When the final edit of Sabrina was completed, it was clear that the filmbelonged to no one but Audrey. Yes, Holden was handsome, and Bogie was,well, Bogie, trying his best to overcome the fish-out-of-water aspect of hav-ing to mutter, “Oh, you look lovely Sabrina.” But as it turned out, even as thebilling listed the three stars in alphabetical order, the scales were tipped in

Audrey’s favor as soon as the words “Once upon a time” were uttered. Starsthough they were, there was nothing “Once Upon a Time” about eitherHumphrey Bogart or William Holden.

In fact, the film’s overt fairy-tale roots caused a pitched battle betweenscreenwriters Lehman and Wilder. Wilder demanded that Sabrina and Linussleep together in Linus’s apartment. Lehman refused: “I absolutely wouldn’tlet Billy do it. . . . He was furious. He said, ‘You’re a middle-class Jewishprude.’ I said, ‘You just can’t do it—I’ll never forgive you.’ And I stubbornlyprevailed.”

And yet, when all was said and done, Bogart may have ultimately proventhe correct choice for the role of Linus; if in fact the role had been played byCary Grant, the optics would have dazzled but all romantic suspense instantlytorpedoed—the audience would have known from the start that Audreywould choose Cary Grant. Anything else would have been unimaginable.

It may have been Bogie and not Cary Grant onscreen, but the success ofthe film was evident right from the terrific opening shot of Audrey/Sabrina ina tree, gazing at the Larrabees’ ball and desperately wanting to be a part ofthat enchanted scene. Barefoot and dressed down, a vulnerable-to-loveAudrey Hepburn embodied the yearning, hope, and promise of youth and firstlove. (Concerning the wan 1994 remake of Sabrina starring Julia Ormond,Wilder dismissively stated: “But in the remake, there was a cold fish in thattree. She was not right, she was not in love.”)

With her fairy tale aura, Audrey unsurprisingly provided the film’s mostalluring moments. To wit:

Standing in the Long Island train station after she returns from Paris, anewly sophisticated Sabrina is revealed. The sequence is made all themore effective by the fact that Sabrina’s Parisian transformation hasbeen deliberately withheld from the audience until this point. Aside fromthe opening sequence, Sabrina has only been glimpsed while washingcars with her father or attending a cooking class in Paris. But now, backon American soil at the Glen Cove train station, the distance traveled inher transformation is fully on display: with her short hair, pleated turban,heels, and gold hoop earrings, Audrey’s appearance is specifically de-signed to accent her Givenchy-designed ottoman tailleur suit with cinchwaist. As the camera pans from shoes to hat and the soundtrack swells

with “La Vie en Rose,” it’s no surprise to find that William Holden’sDavid Larrabee screeches to a halt as he drives by, clearly wonderingwho this exotic creature could be.

Originally, David was to recognize Sabrina right away, but it wasscreenwriter Ernest Lehman who smartly realized, “The scene needed aconcept, a gimmick, a trick”—the concept being that Sabrina was nowso sophisticated in appearance that she proved unrecognizable tosomeone who had watched her grow up. As the camera pulls back, thesense of fashion’s transformative power, courtesy of Hubert deGivenchy and Audrey Hepburn, dazzles.

The camera, in fact, seems to caress the suit’s very fabric, the beautifully sen-sual garment wordlessly conveying that this new Sabrina is no longer a girl—she is her own, very interesting, woman. The suit is not just a matter of ap-pearance because Sabrina is hereby announcing the change in her economicstatus and, by extension, her sexual status. If clothes make the man, then theyhere define the woman. It’s a trope played out nearly forty years later by oneof Hepburn’s Hollywood successors, Julia Roberts, in her 1990 megahitPretty Woman; trading in her tacky hooker clothes for an elaborate ball gownand jewels, Julia Roberts faced forward, flashed her trademark megawattsmile, and the entire moviegoing audience capitulated.

A second dazzling scene—

Sabrina/Audrey floats by in her extraordinary, paneled Givenchy gown,blithely asking her lifelong crush David Larrabee (Holden), “Would youlike to kiss me?” Her impossibly thin waist and impeccable posturecomplete the picture all on their own, and the audience supplies its ownhighly affirmative answer.

Sabrina has wowed not only both Larrabee brothers but also all their aristo-cratic friends attending the ball, and in the process arrived at the key momentin her personal journey. This former schoolgirl is now a woman of formid-able charm, beauty, and self-possession, sophisticated yet still full of joy—two women in one (it is no accident that when Sabrina later cooks for Linusin his office kitchen, her shadow is fragmented, the top forming a separatepiece from the bottom).

# And finally—

Having figured out that it is the businesslike sardonic Linus who isworthy of her attentions, Sabrina finally kisses the curmudgeonly olderman, and in a series of beautiful but fleeting images, her face registersshock, awe, and the sheer pleasure of being alive and fully in love. Ifthat reaction took, to use Bogart’s expression, thirty-six takes, then itwas worth the wait.

Part of the reason for Audrey’s rather seismic leap to stardom in her first twofilms lay not just in her unparalleled ability to portray a Cinderella figure butalso in her very apparent gift at conveying a real sense of wonder at thefoibles of the human race. No one else on the scene possessed such an acuteability to convey wistfulness, and after just two starring roles she was begin-ning to solidify and refine a singular screen persona. If Katharine Hepburnprojected aristocratic Yankee independence brought down to earth by salt ofthe earth Spencer Tracy, then Audrey Hepburn personified a vulnerable girlmorphing into a woman while gliding elegantly, if sometimes uncertainly,through life on her own terms. Sensuous, the very definition of lithe, and per-haps a bit untouchable, she consistently projected a feeling of “I need you.”Eager to protect her, audiences willingly surrendered, their acquiescencenever dissipating even when they realized that Audrey was, in fact, more thancapable of taking care of herself.

With Sabrina, Audrey had now triumphed for a second time, but Holly-wood columnist Dorothy Manners sounded what turned out to be a prescient,cautionary note: “I am beginning to believe she is not the easiest actress inthe world to cast. In a lovely, charged, breathless way she is almost as styl-ized as the other Miss Hepburn . . .” Stylization had never hindered KatharineHepburn, and it would not stop Audrey from rising to the pinnacle of Holly-wood, but Manners was onto something. Audrey had to exercise extreme carein choosing her roles. She was believable as a Cinderella figure, and seemedright at home in aristocratic circles, but would she ring true in, say, a west-ern?

That answer would come five years later with The Unforgiven, but withthe opening of Sabrina, the chorus singing her praises continued to swell byleaps and bounds. In the words of journalist Louis Sobol: “You’ll feel like

buying Paramount stock after viewing Sabrina with three stars namedAudrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and Bill Holden. The play was great—the picture is great—and Audrey is the greatest . . .”

In the words of Jeanine Basinger: “Sabrina would not work withoutAudrey, or at the least, not work in the same way, as we saw with the remake.Sabrina herself is like the older sister of Princess Ann in Roman Holiday, butit’s reversed: instead of a princess stuck in the castle, it’s the chauffeur’sdaughter trapped in the role designated to her by society. The key is that bothwomen are trapped, and it works because Sabrina is here ‘trapped’ in an eleg-ant, witty, hilarious script.”

Audrey’s ability to project a sense of down-to-earth royalty allowed audi-ences to believe in her both as the daydreaming girl on Long Island as well asthe ultrasophisticated young woman returning from Paris. Cosmopolitan sheis, but she hasn’t lost the wistful quality of the girl she was. In Basinger’ssmart words: “Audrey Hepburn is here sporting a totally original and spectac-ular look. This level of fashion is really fashion-fashion, not movie fashion.She’s the only one who could successfully pull that off—wearing fashion-fashion in a way that still allows her to define the character.” In Audrey’sacute self-assessment: “What has always helped me are the clothes. It was of-ten an enormous help to know you looked the part—then the rest wasn’t sotough anymore. . . . Clothes have often given me the confidence I needed be-cause I was insecure about myself.”

In an odd way, for all its success, Sabrina is an underrated film, the knee-jerk reaction reducing the charm of the film to that of a comedy starring theenviably thin Audrey Hepburn in fashion plate mode. But when this fashionplate puts on her beautiful Givenchy dresses, her character is fleshed out, notreduced. Audrey Hepburn wears the couture with ease—the gowns neverwear her.

Audrey still doubted her own startling success, but even her reservationswere swept aside in the wake of the film’s six Oscar nominations: Audrey—Best Actress; Wilder—Best Director; Wilder, Taylor, and Lehman—BestScreenplay; Edith Head—Costume Design; Charles Lang—Cinematography;Hal Pereira and Walter Tyler—Art Direction. On Oscar night, only EdithHead triumphed, and it was the manner of the win, or more precisely the ac-ceptance speech, which actually upset Audrey; her own loss to Grace Kellyfor The Country Girl could be shrugged off, but Audrey knew better than

anyone that Edith Head had not designed any of those attention-grabbinghaute couture outfits the Academy members had acknowledged with theirvotes.

No, those dresses had been created, start to finish, by the man with whomAudrey had just embarked upon the longest, most fulfilling “romance” of herlife—Hubert de Givenchy.

# Chapter ThirteenSOUL MATES, 1953–1993

“They were just way up there in the sky, you know, and I’m sure if he dies,he’s gonna look her up.”

—Billy Wilder on the relationship between Hubert de Givenchy and AudreyHepburn

ABOUT THOSE SHOW-STOPPING CLOTHES IN Sabrina.

Edith Head—solid, reliable, award-winning Edith Head—had actuallybeen assigned to design Audrey’s clothes for Sabrina. Which was all welland good after their successful collaboration on Roman Holiday, but Audreyhad something else in mind for Sabrina. Something more European, some-thing and someone from Paris.

Who did she have in mind? No one less than the famed Spanish-born cou-turiere Cristóbal Balenciaga. The competitive Edith Head was not pleased,but ever the politician, she figured that when Audrey came back to Holly-wood with her high-fashion gowns, it would be a straightforward affair toshow all parties involved that the haute couture gowns would not work forthe demands of a movie. Who would then save the day? Edith Head. Or soshe thought.

Off to Paris went Audrey. It was summer, 1953, and she was free andfootloose in the world’s most glamorous city. The Parisian lights beckoned—especially with a Hollywood studio footing the bill. As documented by SamWasson in his book Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.: Audrey Hepburn, Breakfast atTiffany’s, and the Dawn of the Modern Woman, Frank Caffey, Paramountstudio manager, wrote Russell Holman, a lawyer in Paramount’s New Yorkoffice, informing him that Audrey would now shop in Paris for a dark suit,blouses, hats, and a “very smart French day dress.”

The ever-practical studio noted that the clothes were to be bought as partof Audrey’s private wardrobe, thereby ensuring that no duty need be paidwhen she returned to the United States. And in that letter from Caffey to Hol-man lay one key sentence: “Obviously we cannot afford to give any screencredit and the clothes as selected and modified by Hepburn should be underthe guise of her own wardrobe without reference to Paramount.” No matter—who was even thinking about wardrobe screen credit at the time? Audrey wassimply going to pick up a dark suit and one oh-so-chic French day dress.

But a rather large hiccup now arose. Balenciaga, it turned out, was simplytoo pressed for time to be of service. His suggestion: speak to Hubert deGivenchy. That all seemed to make sense, because Audrey’s shopping wouldbe overseen by Gladys de Segonzac, the wife of the head of Paramount’sParis office—and a woman who knew Givenchy from his time working at thesalon of the legendary Elsa Schiaparelli. In fact, the now twenty-six-year-oldGivenchy had served as the director of Schiaparelli’s boutique for four years,leaving the fashion doyenne only when he decided to open his own salon.Courtly and elegant, the six-foot, four-inch Givenchy was never seen at workwithout a white linen smock draped over his own suit, a gentle giant whononetheless possessed a will of iron, the only designer who dared ban thepress from attending his shows.

Well, Gladys thought, the combination of Hepburn and Givenchy mightprove an excellent pairing of styles. Audrey, she knew, shared Givenchy’slove of clean lines, and a meeting was quickly arranged at Givenchy’s salon.To meet the imposing Givenchy, Audrey dressed not up, not down, but asherself, in clothes that expressed the singular nature of her own personality:plain pants, ballet flats, and a t-shirt, the outfit accented by a straw hat em-blazoned with the legend “Venezia.” Stylish, whimsical, and her own wo-man.

Givenchy appeared more than a bit startled by this twenty-four-year-oldapparition in the grand salon of the House of Givenchy. (In later years he ad-mitted to thinking, “This is too much!”) Not that his eye didn’t instantly takein the singular nature of the woman standing before him. It was just that hethought an appointment with “Miss Hepburn” meant Katharine Hepburn, andinstead of the athletic all-American Kate, he was faced with a lovely, charm-ing young woman who wanted to order wardrobe for a new film entitled Sab-rina. (The Katharine/Audrey confusion would be reversed in humorous fash-

ion when Katharine Hepburn starred in her one and only Broadway musicalCoco, based upon the life of Coco Chanel. Given Katharine’s noticeable lackof singing and dancing skills, Broadway wags circulated the rumor that onthe first day of rehearsal, choreographer Michael Bennett exclaimed: “Iwanted Audrey Hepburn, not Katharine!”)

At the time of their first meeting, however, Audrey struck Givenchy “likea very fragile animal. She had such beautiful eyes, she was so slender—andshe wore no makeup!” Dreda Mele, the directrice of Givenchy, instantlygrasped Audrey’s special quality: “[She] was like the arrival of a summerflower. She was lumineuse—radiant, in both a physical and spiritual sense. Ifelt immediately how lovely she was, inside and out.”

The legendary Katharine Hepburn she wasn’t, but Givenchy was nonethe-less captivated by the flat-chested beauty with the saucer eyes, military pos-ture, and slicked-back hair. He sensed a kindred spirit: both were aristocraticin bearing, nominally Protestant, and definitely European.

Instinctively, he realized that her spare lines were a perfect match for hispared-down sense of design. It was too bad then, Hubert explained, that hewas simply too busy and could not undertake the job of costuming the actressfor her film. Audrey pleaded—could she please just take a moment to lookthrough his designs? Givenchy relented—yes, she could look. But he was stilltoo busy.

Audrey’s eyes lit upon a gray wool suit and tried it on. The designer in-stantly capitulated, in later years recalling: “The change from the little girlwho arrived that morning was unbelievable. The way she moved in the suit,she was so happy. She said that it was exactly what she wanted for the movie.She gave a life to the clothes—she had a way of installing herself in them thatI have seen in no one else since.” Vanity Fair would lovingly detail the suitas “an Oxford-gray wool-ottoman tailleur with a cinch-waisted, double-breasted scoop-neck jacket and a slim, calf-length vented skirt.” To Audrey,it was joyfully “jazzy.”

A total of three outfits were instantly chosen: the first was the “jazzy” graysuit. The second, much to Audrey’s delight, was a black silk cocktail dresscut low in the back, with tiny bows on each shoulder, and a square cut neck-line that eventually came to be called “decollete Sabrina.” Always self-con-scious about her prominent collarbone, Audrey found that the high “Sabrinaneckline” suited her taste perfectly. Collarbone covered, the emphasis now

lay upon her throat and—there was no other word for it—swanlike neck. Inlater years, that very feature would be memorialized in a well-received novelby Alan Brown entitled Audrey Hepburn’s Neck, and it even found its wayinto the 1981 Neil Simon movie Only When I Laugh, with overweight actor“Jimmy” (James Coco) plaintively sighing: “I always wanted to have a necklike Audrey Hepburn.”

Hubert’s dress, thought Audrey, was nearly perfect—it just needed onefinishing touch, which she quickly decided should be a hat. The entire outfitwas now topped by a toque which Audrey herself found in Givenchy’s salon,one studded with rhinestones, and completed by a series of idiosyncraticpeaks that made it look more than a little like a crown. Said Givenchy: “Shealways puts the finishing touch on my work.” As Sean Ferrer pointed out, itwas a true collaboration: “Givenchy always said they had to figure out how toadapt his clothes to the character she was portraying in the films. He didn’thave time to design all the clothes from scratch, and my mother always knewwhat was best for her. It was a lifelong collaboration and friendship. Wonder-ful.”

But it was the third of the Givenchy creations chosen by Audrey for Sab-rina that proved the stunner, a perfect blend of spare shapes and pure colorssignaling the arrival of a woman who could triumphantly meet the Larrabeeson their home ground. This ball gown would serve as the official crowning ofSabrina Fairchild as Cinderella, and prove to be of far more import than anyglass slipper. How could an ordinary glass slipper compete with a whitestrapless organdy gown with detachable overskirt, accented by an embroideryof jet beads on both the top and skirt?

If Givenchy’s idol Balenciaga had once said “the secret of elegance iselimination,” then Hubert had here delivered the ultimate proof of the maes-tro’s maxim. No feathers, no swirling ornamentation—just a dress of richfabric designed along classical lines, one capable of enhancing character byannouncing the arrival of the new Sabrina and, not so coincidentally, ofGivenchy himself. In this, their first film together, Audrey and Givenchy hadalready achieved symbiosis. Said French fashionista Dreda Mele: “She wasattracted by the image he could give her. And she entered that image totally.She entered into his dream, too. I repeat; they were made for each other.”

So special did the gown prove to be, not just to the moviegoing audienceeagerly awaiting Sabrina’s final transformation but also to Audrey herself,

that while shooting The Nun’s Story five years later, Audrey told her castmatePatricia Bosworth that the gown was her very favorite of all: “Yes, it washeaven. An angelic bouffant layered gown . . .” To Bosworth, who had avidlywatched Sabrina in a movie theatre, the dress singlehandedly capturedAudrey’s essence: “The slim boyish figure with the airborne femininity.When Audrey walked in it, it was if she were walking on air.”

Even such perfectly tailored Givenchy designs, however, were never onlyabout Audrey’s body, but instead about the lines of the fabric, lines best ex-hibited when draped on Audrey’s model-thin torso. In her own words:“Somehow his clothes have always been right for me, for my body. It’s neverelegant and pompous.” With her one-of-a-kind beauty defined by the featuresshe herself found so irregular, the clothes not only proved to be co-stars ofsorts, but they also helped to make her seem approachable, the friendly,dazzling, and popular nice girl of fantasy.

Audrey intuitively grasped that the designer’s clothes completed her ownessential self because Hubert made a virtue out of what others might haveconsidered deficiencies. If Audrey was tall and extremely thin, then cinchedwaists and narrow-cut pants would even things out—flaws turned into vir-tues. At the same time, she enhanced Givenchy’s designs in ways even thedesigner himself could not have anticipated, explaining: “There’s a wonderfulFrench word—depouille—without ornament—with everything strippedaway. There’s a purity about his clothes but always with a sense of humor.”

Here was fashion which allowed Audrey to show her own distinctive per-sonality. Said Givenchy: “In film after film, Audrey wore clothes with suchtalent and flair that she created a style, which in turn had a major impact onfashion. Her chic, her youth, her bearing, and her silhouette grew evermorecelebrated, enveloping me in a kind of aura or radiance that I could neverhave hoped for.”

In a fulsome, heartfelt tribute, Audrey explained: “His are the only clothesin which I am myself. He is far more than couturiere, he is a creator of per-sonality.” But Audrey herself is not fully accurate here, because by the timeshe met Hubert, her own talent and loving yet determined personality werealready blossoming—the extraordinary Givenchy wardrobe simply enhancedthe package. Audrey’s three-time director Stanley Donen once remarked,somewhat unkindly, “Audrey was almost more about fashion than movies oracting,” but that assessment is at once inaccurate and slightly ungenerous: it

was her singing and dancing in his Funny Face and her tough yet vulnerableperformance in the Donen-directed Two for the Road, that made us rememberthe clothes, not the reverse.

No Hollywood actress has ever worn clothes with more of an instinctiveflair for fashion than Audrey Hepburn, and all the Givenchy dresses in theworld would not make audiences pay attention seventy years later if not forAudrey’s own style and personality. It’s the totality of her persona to whichaudiences have always responded; if it weren’t, those audiences might as wellbe collectively mooning over pictures of Babe Paley, who in the mid-twenti-eth century was repeatedly voted the best dressed woman of the year, yet inthe twenty-first century remains a social footnote, the leading “swan” amongTruman Capote’s coterie of wealthy female friends.

As Audrey and Hubert’s friendship evolved, equal parts designer/client,best friends, and brother/sister, their relationship affected both profoundly.Said Audrey: “Hubert and I are very much alike. We love the same things.We’re hurt by the same things. I think we’re both very sensitive.” In Sean’swords: “They consulted with each other on everything.”

Their friendship deepened so quickly that Hepburn took to sometimes call-ing Givenchy simply to tell him how much she loved him—“and then she’dsay bye-bye and hang up. She remained from that time on absolutely, unbe-lievably loyal to me and everyone here at the house. The entire staff adoredher, everyone had enormous respect for her—she became part of the family. .. . I have always considered her my sister.”

Yet close as the two were, even Hubert sensed that certain closed-off,private parts of Audrey’s life remained: “She shared her joy with friends, butkept her unhappy moments to herself.” In a rather revealing interview givenin 1954 right after she had first burst upon the scene, Audrey explained herattitude toward dealing with questions about her private life: “It’s hard work,really, harder than preparing for a play. You keep giving performances all thetime.”

But with Hubert, Audrey could lower her guard, and from their first meet-ing onward, their friendship/collaboration succeeded so beautifully that EdithHead’s plan to point out the deficiencies in the Givenchy designs fizzled onthe spot. Her contribution to Audrey’s look in the film was now limited todesigning Sabrina’s pre-makeover clothes and executing the black cocktaildress and hat from Givenchy’s sketch. Interviewed in the 1970s, Hepburn ex-

plained “Edith was very good about it,” but, writes Head’s biographer DavidChierichetti, if Audrey actually believed that, then “Edith was a better actressthan most, for she was seething, even thirty years later when I asked herabout it.”

Head’s contribution may have been extremely limited, but at the AcademyAwards of 1955 she was nonetheless anointed the winner for Best Costumedesign. It was an Oscar that actually brought Audrey unhappiness, because, itwas eminently clear, the Academy voters were really rewarding Head for themost memorable and striking of the film’s clothes: the suit Sabrina wore atthe Glen Cove train station, the little black dress seen at the cocktail party,and above all, the embroidered flowing gown which stunned everyone at theLarrabee ball. Clothes all designed by Hubert de Givenchy.

As the ironclad Hollywood contract made clear, however, Edith Headwould be the only designer receiving credit on Sabrina. Never once wouldthe name Hubert de Givenchy be mentioned, even on the evening of March30, 1955, when Head willingly accepted the Academy Award for Sabrina.Loathe to grant credit to even her most trusted assistants, Head not only re-fused to recognize Givenchy on the night of the Academy Awards but untilher death continued to claim credit for designing both the famous ball gownand the black cocktail dress. Wrote David Chierichetti: “Unknowingly I useda picture of the ballgown in Hollywood Costume Design and gave Edithcredit for it, and she did not correct me when she reviewed my manuscript.”When he subsequently brought up this error to Head, she barked: “I lied. Sowhat? If I bought a sweater at Bullock’s Wilshire, do I have to give themcredit too?”

Perhaps Head convinced herself that she had actually designed the dress,and Givenchy himself remarked that the lack of mention must have been theresult of “an oversight.” Even decades later he would only allow himself towonder: “Imagine if I had received credit for Sabrina then, at the beginningof my career. It would have helped. But it doesn’t matter—a few yearspassed, and then everyone knew. Anyway, what could I do? I didn’t reallycare. I was so pleased to dress Miss Hepburn.”

In the future, Givenchy would, at Audrey’s insistence, always receivescreen credit for all the designs she wore onscreen in Funny Face, Love in theAfternoon, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Charade, Paris When It Sizzles, How toSteal a Million, Bloodline, and Love Among Thieves. Never again, decreed

Audrey, would there be a debacle à la Sabrina. She wanted the world toknow of the beautiful work done by her friend—“the single person I knowwith the greatest integrity.” Hubert, whose status subsequently grew to thepoint that he provided Jacqueline Kennedy’s dress for the funeral of PresidentKennedy, returned the compliment: “She kept her promise. This was one ofthe most marvelous things about her. She thought constantly of others.”

Their professional relationship eventually expanded far beyond the worldof Hollywood. It was Hubert who designed the dress for her wedding tosecond husband Andrea Dotti, as well as the christening gowns used at thebaptisms of her sons Sean and Luca. Such was her loyalty to Hubert that shewore his designs with such frequency that they began to fray: “I don’t replaceclothes until they can’t be worn. I’ll wear the skirt of an old suit with sweat-ers. I had a red coat—the one in Charade—by Hubert, of course. I wore ituntil the threads began to separate and it was all shiny on the edges.”

Small wonder then, that their enduring friendship, a very real, platoniclove affair, lasted throughout Audrey’s life. When she turned sixty in 1989,Givenchy had sixty pink rosebushes planted in the garden of her belovedhome, La Paisible, and very purposefully, Audrey asked him to serve as anexecutor of her estate.

Till death do us part—or the threads begin to separate.

# Chapter FourteenMEETING MEL, 1953–1968

“When I fell in love and married, I lived in a constant fear of being left. Iwas terrified that someone else would take them away from me. I learnedthat you can’t love without the fear of losing.”

—Audrey Hepburn

AUDREY’S PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP with Givenchy proved tobe the most solid and long-lasting male friendship of her entire life, but bythe time of their life-altering platonic liaison, she had already begun her firstserious relationship since the departure of James Hanson. It was, in fact, amarriage-serious romance which dated back to the time of Roman Holiday’sLondon premiere in 1953.

Audrey had greatly admired Mel Ferrer’s performance as the bitter, handi-capped puppeteer in Lili, a small, charming film which starred the gamine-like Leslie Caron and featured the award winning song “Hi-Lili Hi-Lo.”Caron, in fact, reminded many of Audrey herself: a trained dancer who hadskyrocketed to stardom starring opposite Gene Kelly in An American inParis, Caron would go on to play Audrey’s titular roles in both Gigi (stageand film) and Ondine (stage). Caron and Ferrer had clicked together nicelyonscreen, his height and craggy good looks registering with decided impactopposite the petite Caron, and while Audrey may not have known Ferrer, hisonscreen Lili alter ego “Paul” attracted her enormously.

Twelve years older than Audrey, Ferrer, like James Hanson, nicely fitAudrey’s preference for older men who could serve as protective father fig-ures. He was a six-foot, three-inch tall native of New Jersey, with striking,though not classically handsome, looks. Confident he was, but with a well-hidden vulnerability resulting from a childhood bout with polio. Princeton

educated, with a Cuban surgeon father, a socialite mother, and a physiciansister, Mel was at ease in any social setting and projected confidence at allturns.

Having begun his career as a dancer—Clifton Webb taught him how to tapdance—Mel shared Audrey’s facility with languages and spoke fluent Span-ish, French, and English. When the politically liberal Audrey found out thatFerrer had made a successful movie of striking social conscience, LostBoundaries (1949), her interest heightened further. Based upon an articlewritten by William L. White, a light-skinned African American physician,Ferrer starred in the film as “Dr. Scott Mason Carter,” who, unable to findwork as a black physician, reluctantly decides to pass as white until events re-veal his true identity.

The film, produced for a mere $\$ 250,000$ , grossed over $\$ 5$ million, andafter being shown at the White House during its initial release, it helped in-spire President Truman to push legislation allowing African Americans to be-come officers in the U.S. Navy. In Mel’s own view, the film proved to be“light years ahead” of the socially conscious Pinky and Home of the Brave,which were released in the same year, and he remained proud of the film,stating “I still consider it the best movie I was ever lucky enough to be in.”

Wildly ambitious from the start, Mel had set his eyes on concurrent ca-reers as a director/producer as well as actor, and by the time he met Audrey,he had directed José Ferrer (no relation) in Cyrano de Bergerac (1946) onBroadway. As it turned out, another director had ultimately restaged parts ofCyrano, but Mel’s desire to also direct a movie had remained, and he sub-sequently directed two smaller films, The Girl of the Limberlost (1945), andSecret Fury (1950). Neither film made much of an impact, but he nursed hisdirecting ambitions while continuing to act in high-profile films like 1953’sKnights of the Round Table (playing King Arthur to Ava Gardner’s QueenGuinevere).

By now, Audrey’s friendship with Gregory Peck had deepened to the pointwhere she felt free to approach him with a personal request at the July 1953London premiere of Roman Holiday: Could he help her meet Mel Ferrer?Peck performed the introductions, with Audrey explaining to Mel: “I saw youin Lili—I loved it. That’s why I asked Greg Peck to introduce you to me.”Her reaction to this in-person meeting proved muted: “The thing I remembermost about that first meeting was that he was so serious. He didn’t smile. I

liked him . . . but that was all.”

The two actors struck up a wide-ranging conversation and Audrey grewintrigued; Mel was educated and cultured, able to converse about politicalmatters of the day as easily as Hollywood grosses, and with his older, gravemien, exuded an aura of confidence and all-encompassing protection. The af-fection between the two grew daily, and like grew into love. This, she wasconvinced, was the real thing. Plans were made, and Audrey gave Mel a plat-inum watch engraved with the Noël Coward song title “Mad About the Boy.”

By this time, Ferrer had already been married three times, twice to FrancesPilchard, with whom he had a son and daughter, as well as once to BarbaraTripp, with whom he also had a son and daughter. His self-assurance anddrive appealed to Audrey, and as the demands for her time and attention grewdaily in the face of her acclaimed performance in Roman Holiday, the needfor a protector loomed large. Analyzed Robert Wolders: “She was in part at-tracted to Mel because he was like a father figure to her. . . . It’s true that hetook over her life, but she wanted to be protected and she trusted Mel. In asense, she did that with me as well.” And even if Ella remained displeasedwith Mel’s previous marital history (said Audrey in later years—“It ate awayat me that they couldn’t get along.”), Audrey herself remained blissfullyhappy.

Ella may have disapproved of Mel’s multiple previous marriages, but oneyear after that first Gregory Peck–arranged meeting, Audrey and Mel marriedon September 24, 1954, in a civil ceremony at the mayor’s home in Buochs,Switzerland. The vows were repeated the next day in a religious ceremonyheld at a thirteenth-century chapel in Bürgenstock, Switzerland. On a veryfoggy day, Audrey wore a high-necked, tea-length Pierre Balmain dress, witha satin sash tied in the back, her hair accented by a crown of white roses. Shepronounced herself blissfully happy.

Desperate not to repeat the mistakes of her parents, Audrey spoke of a de-termination to make her marriage every bit as important as her career: “Ithink marriage and art can develop together. The thing to remember is thatyou have to work at both. . . . When I got married to Mel I decided that if Iworked for, say, three months on my own career, I would save another threemonths for being a married woman and a proper wife.” Not for Audrey theshortcoming she viewed as inherent in American style marriage: “Americanwomen have a tendency to take over too much and in that way they miss out

on a lot of fun that their European sisters have.”

Audrey held a British passport while Mel remained a citizen of the UnitedStates, but a mutual decision was made to apply for residency in Switzerland.Audrey could and did appreciate aspects of life in the United States and theUnited Kingdom, but she held a lifelong self-identification as European andwanted to remain living on the continent where she had grown up. Practicalmatters figured in the decision as well: if the couple had settled in the UK,they would have been faced with a 90 percent tax rate on their rapidly in-creasing earnings.

Audrey quickly embraced the sense of quietude found in their home on theBürgenstock mountain in Switzerland; that pricey hideaway, which main-tained its own police force, consisted of three hotels situated on five hundredacres high above Lake Lucerne and came complete with a golf course, tenniscourts, and pool. If it did not, in Audrey’s mind, represent a permanent resid-ence, it was one she felt could still serve as a home base. Except when sheand Mel were on the road—which was, given their careers, all of the time.

For Audrey, who had grown up in three different countries in the midst ofWorld War II, the four-star hotels they stayed in while filming on locationstill had to exude a semblance of home. She wanted to be surrounded by herown belongings, not the hotel’s, which meant that the Hepburn-Ferrer cara-van consisted of no fewer than fifty fully packed trunks and suitcases, markedby a clearly delineated division of labor: Mel made all the arrangements,Audrey did the packing, and, she emphasized, “carried my own bags.” Withconstant moves from film set to film set, hotel to hotel, and even continent tocontinent, detailed, numbered lists were typed for each trunk and suitcase,with all of the lists clipped into a binder where Audrey could locate every ob-ject at a moment’s notice.

This near obsessive attention to detail unfolded as an elaborate, ex-traordinarily upscale traveling sideshow, the trunks filled with Audrey’s ownchina, books, candelabra, cashmere blankets, white silk pillows, family pho-tographs, lamps, and silverware. Especially in Paris, where the Raphael Hotelproved home base during the filming of Funny Face and Love in the After-noon, it seemed as if the entire contents of the Bürgenstock villa had beentransported over the borders. The desire to control by creating order out ofchaos persisted until the end of her life, and in an interview conducted afterAudrey had passed away, Sean commented: “When she would get time off,

between her UNICEF trips, she would spend a lot of time upstairs in thehouse organizing her things. Really, when she passed away, everything wasperfectly ordered.”

There were, inevitably, stresses and strains which accompanied the cease-less moving, with one inescapable irony underlying it all: Mel was far morecareer focused, indeed driven, than Audrey, but it was Audrey who remainedthe internationally popular and adored star. That balance was to remainwildly uneven throughout their marriage, a bitter pill that was not easy forMel to swallow. If Audrey had eclipsed Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday, andboth Bogart and Holden in Sabrina, what kind of chance did the committedbut less-skilled Mel have? As it was, within the first years of marriage thenot-so-quiet whispers began: Mel was playing Svengali, insistently tellingAudrey what to do and when. Audrey demurred: “He is a protective husband,and I like it. Most women do.”

Determined to bolster her husband and make the marriage work, Audreyeven gave Mel credit for part of her famous fashion sense: “I’m fortunate tobe married to a fashion-conscious man by the name of Mel Ferrer, whom Ithink has infallible taste.” But try as she might to equalize their professionalstatus with such public praise, the imbalance remained.

This was, after all, the 1950s, and with explicitly defined gender roles—men providing and women staying home—the problem seemed to grow lar-ger, not smaller, by the day. Mel and Audrey could ignore the problem, talkaround it, or even barrel on full steam ahead, but it loomed large on stage andthirty-foot-tall movie screens alike. Staring anyone who paid close attentionto their three joint undertakings right in the face.

# Chapter FifteenEXHIBITS A-B-C, 1954–1957

“Mel’s success in Lili did not bear the fruits that he might have hoped forand in the course of time, he was not pleased to be Mr. Hepburn.”

—Actor Robert Flemyng

Exhibit A: Ondine

Exhibit B: War and Peace

Exhibit C: Mayerling

Exhibit A: Ondine—At the beginning of married life, Mel began to envisionhis partnership with Audrey as a new iteration of Laurence Olivier andVivien Leigh—a married couple united onstage and off. First up: Audrey’spost–Roman Holiday return to Broadway in Jean Giradoux’s Ondine, inwhich she would play the titular character of an androgynous otherworldlyaquatic sprite.

Ondine would be directed by the estimable Alfred Lunt, with original mu-sic composed by Virgil Thomson. With the buzz about Roman Holiday in-creasing by the day, advance box office sales for Ondine began to leap to-ward sellout status, but one rather large problem loomed: playing Ondine’slove interest, “Hans Ritter,” would be Mel Ferrer, and Mel Ferrer was, ifnothing else, cocksure of his own opinions.

At the start, the experience registered as bright, even exciting, with theplay itself seeming all but handcrafted for Audrey: set in the Middle Ages,the Giradoux play, translated into English by Maurice Valency, was basedupon a German legend that had already served as the basis for two operas.Ondine, a water nymph with supernatural powers, falls in love with a knight,and the subsequent blurring of boundaries between the water world and thekingdom of man ends in the death of the knight. Even Audrey’s very physic-

ality seemed tailor-made for the role of Ondine, a presence half of the corpor-eal world and half of the sea. This Ondine could jump from a standing to asitting position, leaving audiences gasping aloud as she leapt directly into co-star Ferrer’s lap. (That same show-stopping move would be repeated tenyears later in My Fair Lady, while Audrey exclaimed that she “Could HaveDanced All Night.”)

And yet, fitting as the role seemed for Audrey, problems arose as soon asrehearsals began. Not with Audrey, whose work ethic remained impeccable.As explained by son Sean in later years: “She could not understand whypeople wanted her . . . and what they thought was so special about her. So shemade up for it by working extra hard.” No, the problem lay with Mel, whochafed under Alfred Lunt’s direction and, it quickly proved clear, wanted todirect Audrey himself. The tension-filled rehearsal period proved frustratingfor Lunt and Ferrer alike, as well as upsetting for Audrey. The entire weightof the production was resting upon her shoulders, and precious rehearsal timewas being eaten up with arguments between her husband/co-star and theshow’s director. Said Lunt in later years: “Ferrer used Audrey’s crush on himto rule her with an iron fist.”

Upset or not, however, Audrey had gained in confidence in the three yearssince she had appeared onstage in Gigi. Now earning $\$ 2,500$ per week, thistime around she believed that she did indeed belong on a Broadway stage.There were no worries about voice projection, no anxiety over rememberinglines. Said fellow cast member, the Tony Award–winning actress MarianSeldes: “I loved watching her rehearse and act. How beautiful she made otherpeople feel! That was her magic on and off the screen.” (Seldes was more re-served in her assessment of Baroness Ella, who had by now appeared on thescene: “She was very correct, beautifully dressed and coiffed—but daunting,rather aloof, and undemonstrative.”)

Whatever affection Ella withheld from Audrey was more than made up forby critics and audiences alike, and after a tryout in Boston, when the playopened on Broadway, the tough-to-please New York City critics fell overthemselves in their rush to praise Audrey. Richard Watts in the New YorkPost called her performance “irresistible,” going on to write: “Magic it seemsto me, is exactly the right word to apply to Miss Hepburn . . . she manages tomake her role at once immensely moving and eerily unworldly.” The dean oftheatrical critics, Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times, capitulated en-

tirely: “She gives a pulsing performance that is all grace and enchantment,disciplined by an instinct for the realities of the stage.” The ultimate tribute,however, came from Walter Kerr in the New York Herald Tribune, who wit-tily wrote: “She is every man’s dream of the nymph he once planned tomeet.”

Amidst this wild acclaim, grumbles were heard on opening night. Notabout Audrey, who modestly accepted the audience’s shower of approval, butrather about the actual curtain calls. Why, people wondered, did Audrey, whocarried the confection of a story entirely upon her own shoulders, forego asolo curtain call and instead take her bows with Mel? In the immediate after-math of the opening, whispers began that Mel had insisted upon a joint cur-tain call, and the chorus of disapproval grew louder, until, “six weeks later,Audrey was once again taking solo curtain calls.”

Ondine opened on February 18, 1954. Two months later Audrey won theAcademy Award for Roman Holiday. One week after that she won the TonyAward as Best Actress for Ondine. By winning the Oscar and the Tony in thesame year, she had equaled a feat achieved only by Shirley Booth and, in thefuture, Bob Fosse.

The world was Audrey’s oyster.

But she wasn’t happy.

Grateful—yes. Full of praise for her teammates—and she thought of themall as a team—on the play. She was exhausted, however, worn down by threeyears of solid work. A new set of whispers began: Audrey was having anervous breakdown from the strain. A breakdown? Untrue.

But she was, in fact, depressed. Even at this high point of her career, hap-piness remained elusive. The feeling of having been deserted by her fatherhad never fully vanished and the near starvation and horror of living underthe Nazis haunted her memory.

Remaining optimistic remained an act of willpower for Audrey. She puton a brave face, and her manners, the desire to put others at ease, remainedimpeccable. But much as she liked the theatre, insisting that her contract withParamount allow her twelve months between films for the theatre—“I havelearned the little I know about acting from my stage work, and I think I’llcontinue to learn from the theatre”—she left Broadway and the standing-room-only audiences at Ondine to spend the summer recuperating in Switzer-land. She felt guilty that the play would now close—it was impossible to en-

vision audiences accepting any other actress as a replacement for her. But un-der the strain she had lost even more weight from her alarmingly thin frame,and her anemia had returned with a vengeance. A rest was not just needed,but mandatory.

There would be rumors of other stage work throughout the ensuing years,talk that she might star in the title role of Maxwell Anderson’s Mary of Scot-land, with Helen Hayes playing Queen Elizabeth. Another trial balloon:Would Audrey play Juliet at Stratford-upon-Avon? Perhaps a turn as eitherAriel or Miranda in The Tempest. Even better: Audrey playing half the weekas Ariel, and the other half as Miranda.

Nothing ever came of any of it. For now she would rest and relax inSwitzerland. Mull over possible film scripts. But most of all she wanted ababy, knowing with rock ribbed certainty that she would not feel completeuntil she became a mother.

She would never return to the Broadway stage.

Exhibit B: War and Peace—Wanting to keep busy, in 1955 Audrey al-lowed herself to be wooed back to work. The film that beckoned was nothingless than War and Peace. The Mount Everest of novels was being turned intoa Hollywood epic, and if Audrey could not yet have the family she so de-sired, then she wanted to be a part of War and Peace, to prove that she wascapable of stretching herself as an actress.

A savvy reader, Audrey knew a great role when she saw it: NatashaRostova, a lighthearted pretty girl in early nineteenth-century Russia, buf-feted by war and the death of loved ones, evolves from spoiled girl to a wo-man of surprising fortitude over the course of the novel’s twelve hundredpages, proving capable of surviving Napoleon’s invasion of her homelandjust as the teenage Audrey outlasted the Nazis. Survival trumped all.

Like others associated with the film, Audrey was also struck by the factthat Tolstoy’s very description of Natasha sounded a great deal like Audreyherself: “This black-eyed, wide mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life, withchildish bare shoulders . . . black curls tossed backwards, thin bare arms andfeet in low slippers.” Even Prince Andrei’s declaration of love for Natashasounds like what Mel—or more likely William Holden—would have said ofAudrey herself: “What a joy it is to dance with her. Like holding springtime

in your arms. Like holding a branch of lilac or a kitten.”

Audrey was tempted: a complex character, a first film in color, and oneadditional inducement: the chance to be directed by another certifiable Holly-wood legend, King Vidor. With a career ranging from the days of the silentclassics The Big Parade (1925) and The Crowd (1928) to acclaimed soundmovies like Stella Dallas (1937), Vidor had remained a major player in Hol-lywood for thirty years, one who had even worked uncredited on the Kansassequences in The Wizard of Oz. Nominated for a total of five Oscars (hewould win an honorary Oscar in 1979), he would here be taking on thebiggest movie of his career. The elements unfolding under his supervision:Napoleon’s army. The March on Moscow. The upheaval of an entire nation.An international extravaganza, one produced in Rome by the duo of Dino DeLaurentiis and Carlo Ponti, with a screenplay by six writers from three differ-ent countries. This United Nations approach to the film included British cine-matographer Jack Cardiff, Italian composer Nino Rota, and the British-Dutch-Belgian Audrey. Added to the mix: a $\$ 6$ million budget ( $\$ 67$ milliontoday), seven thousand costumes, several tons of artificial snow flown infrom England, five thousand guns, one hundred thousand buttons, and, inthose pre-CGI days, hundreds of extras.

Although she had not yet formally signed her contract, Audrey hoped thatGregory Peck would be free to play the role of Pierre, but when her RomanHoliday co-star proved unavailable, the role went to Henry Fonda. For therole of Prince Andrei: Mel Ferrer. Would Audrey have made the film withoutMel? Most likely, yes, but they did not like to be apart for long periods oftime, and Audrey, exercising her gentle but iron will, pushed for Mel. Negoti-ations to sign both husband and wife ran not just back and forth but up anddown, as well as backward and forward, conducted as only the volatile DeLaurentiis could; in the end, a high-speed chase found De Laurentiis’s carfollowing Audrey and Mel’s, until contracts held out the car window weresigned. In the words of a New York World Telegram headline: “War & PeaceSettled in Two Speeding Autos.”

The salaries: Audrey: $350,000. Mel: $100,000. When told of her record-setting salary, Audrey murmured to her agent: “I’m not worth it. It’s im-possible. Please don’t tell anyone.” In the Hollywood universe where stars of-ten insisted upon press releases trumpeting their record-setting salaries,Audrey’s wish that her salary not be publicized represented nothing so much

as a new version of giving back unspent per diem. Not publicizing her re-cord-setting salary? With publicity-mad moguls Dino De Laurentiis andCarlo Ponti producing? The chances for silence remained zero.

Although increasingly common by the mid-1950s, Technicolor featureswere still far from a given for ever-cost-conscious producers, but the idea ofshooting the epic War and Peace in black and white was never seriously con-sidered. Which meant that with Audrey facing her first ever Technicolor fea-ture, the call went out to her favorite cinematographer, Franz Planer. Planerproved unavailable, but given Audrey’s love of the virulently colored RedShoes and Black Narcissus, inquiries were made about Jack Cardiff, the es-timable director of photography on those two Michael Powell–directed mas-terpieces.

Cardiff, then in the midst of fashioning one of the all-time great careers incinematography, understood the unique demands of filming camera-con-scious leading ladies. Having expertly photographed Ava Gardner in Pan-dora and the Flying Dutchman (1951) and The Barefoot Contessa (1954), aswell as Katharine Hepburn in The African Queen (1951), he now began bytaking as many photographs of Audrey as possible, studying her face from allpossible angles while analyzing flaws and virtues alike. Said Cardiff: “Herproblem is the jawline. It doesn’t photograph well. You must concentrate onthose great big brown eyes.”

After photographing Audrey for the film, he opined: “Audrey has made asymbol of her eyebrows, emphasized to make them thick and black. I filmedher in War and Peace, and they didn’t seem right for the period. I asked herto soften the bold effects that characterized her success. She agreed.” In theend, Cardiff came to understand the same dichotomy between Audrey’s gen-teel looks and determined personality noted by so many who worked closelywith her: “She has steel determination and delicacy that girl.” He did, how-ever, hold a rather jaundiced view of Mel, explaining that Mel was “like amanager with her as well as a husband. ‘Is the car ready for Miss Hepburn?’ .. . ‘The costume is wrong for Miss Hepburn’ . . . ‘It is too hot (or too cold)for Miss Hepburn.’”

Filming began in July 1955 and did not conclude until November. World-wide press interest remained high, but Audrey’s sense of privacy remainedinviolate: it may have been only her third starring role, but she did not wantany press on the set. Nor, she added, did she want to submit to any interviews

off set, even with the then all-powerful gossip queen Louella Parsons. Whenurged by the studio, however, she ultimately agreed to chat with the colum-nist on the telephone. Already a very savvy player in the Hollywood publicitysweepstakes, Audrey knew that in order to win over Parsons she should senda present; Parsons’s yearly haul of Christmas presents sent by sycophanticstars and studio executives was already legendary, so Audrey sent the colum-nist a basket of flowers—but not just any basket. These flowers did not comein the form of a stiff, formal arrangement from a tony Beverly Hills florist.Instead, Audrey had flowers sent from her own garden. Parsons was im-pressed—she had been kept at arm’s length yet still felt personally honored.Veteran studio publicists, it appeared, could learn a thing or two fromAudrey.

Unlike Roman Holiday and Sabrina, War and Peace would not be shot insequence, the logistics on such an epic dictating otherwise. It all added up toa sizable challenge for Audrey, with each shooting day bringing a differentNatasha. Was she the young carefree Natasha or war-weary, disillusionedNatasha? Was she just getting to know Prince Andrei, or had she already losthim? Tiring as the process was, and exhausting as De Laurentiis could be,Audrey liked filming in Rome, enjoyed eating with the crew, and felt she hadthe support of a bona fide Team Audrey in Vidor, Cardiff, and makeup artistAlberto De Rossi. Pan-European as she was, she thoroughly enjoyed the in-ternational flavor of the film: shot in English, manned by Italians, and even-tually dubbed into French, German, and Spanish.

A first cut of the film ran to five hours. Trims were ordered, with the finaledit whittled down to 208 minutes. The verdict from critics? An internationalmixed bag featuring moments of beauty juxtaposed with a hard-to-follownarrative and wildly varying acting styles.

At its worst, the film features performances by Audrey, Mel, and HenryFonda that seem to have been spliced together from three different films.Which is not to say that the film is without virtues, beginning with Audrey’sgraceful performance and Jack Cardiff’s stunningly composed mise-en-scènes. Cardiff favored a chiaroscuro approach—the screen morphing fromlight to dark and then back to light again, with Audrey’s porcelain white skindeliberately placed against the darkest of backgrounds. There are startlinglyeffective shots of dark crowds huddled against the white landscape of snowyRussia, and one singularly beautiful shot of Audrey’s face in the darkness

during the retreat from Moscow resembles a painting by an old master. Se-quences of French soldiers retreating through mud and snow convey the hor-rors of battle in powerfully affecting fashion and provide moments of beautythat helped audiences forgive some noticeably artificial-looking sets.

In the Audrey universe, however, what is most noteworthy here are the re-lative shortcomings of Mel Ferrer as a leading man. He’s attractive in an off-beat way, but more often than not he appears stiff rather than alive with pas-sion. One always senses an awareness of the camera on Mel’s part, an inabil-ity to let go and show true emotion. While the camera seems to all but caressAudrey’s cheekbones and soulful eyes, with Mel the camera simply appearsto be paying a courtesy call, noting his presence via an occasional close-up ortwo. There is no star heat on display, none of the overt sex appeal that makesaudiences stop in their tracks and pay attention. Called upon to utter granddeclamations as Russia collapses about him, he can’t overcome that inherentwoodenness. He’s better in the quiet moments, but unlike Audrey, he appearsincapable of totally giving himself over to the camera. He’s a man of decidedtalent who often received short shrift in comparison to Audrey, but althoughhe is better here than the miscast Fonda, one senses a talent better suited be-hind the camera than in the center of the frame.

War and Peace represented Vidor’s penultimate film, and he received anAcademy Award nomination for his work, as did costume designer Maria DeMatteis. Vidor also received a Golden Globe nomination, one which was ac-companied by additional nods for the film itself as Best Picture, Oskar Ho-molka (playing Field Marshal Kutuzov) as Supporting Actor, and Audrey asBest Actress. Audrey’s Golden Globe nomination was matched by a BAFTAAward as “Best British Actress,” and the passage of time has revealed thatshe is in fact the most effective presence in the film, her physical grace andwounded expression conveying character in far better fashion than Fonda’ssurprisingly wan turn and Mel’s too often wooden mien. She downplayed herown efforts: “I had no technique, so I had to make believe like children do,”but through her fragile determination, the audience is able to process how theformerly spoiled Natasha has endured the hardships that have changed herinto a complex, recognizable human being.

In the end, however, it’s simply too difficult for the film to achieve anytextual consistency when the accents on display range from aristocratic Brit-ish to Midwestern American, with a stop along the way for a touch of cock-

ney. The story moves in fits and starts, a seeming casualty of six screen-writers from multiple countries laboring over the same script.

Strange as it is to say about the overflowing-with-passion story of Warand Peace, the film seems to simply fade away whenever Audrey is off-screen, flickering back to life only when she returns for the next twist inNatasha’s story. Her warmth and passion inject the intermittently moving butultimately misshapen multinational enterprise with the much-needed vitalitythat involves an audience—but only for as long as she is onscreen.

Perhaps the ultimate compliment to her performance came when War andPeace was filmed once again in 1966, on a budget of $\$ 100$ million suppliedentirely by the Soviet government; in that monumental rendering of thisquintessential Russian story, the role of Natasha was played by ballerina Ly-udmila Savelyeva, who looked like no one so much as Audrey’s lost-at-birthtwin sister.

Exhibit C: Mayerling—One year after War and Peace, Audrey and Melco-starred again, this time in a 1957 television adaptation of Mayerling, theoft-told real-life tale of Austria’s Crown Prince Rudolf and his teenage mis-tress, Baroness Maria Vetsera. The mystery of how the two lovers died to-gether at his hunting lodge in January 1889 has never been solved, a factwhich did not stop either the 1936 movie starring Danielle Darrieux andCharles Boyer or this television production from positing their own solutions:forced to marry another woman, Prince Rudolf could not stop himself fromcontinuing to meet his beloved Maria, and realizing the impossibility of theirrelationship, he shoots her before committing suicide. So much for couplescounseling.

Mayerling, theorizes Sean Ferrer, appealed to his father’s “dramatic senseof theatre,” which is understandable given the story’s hold on the popularimagination. Marveled Billy Wilder: “When I was in Vienna, in the ’20s,every week in the Sunday supplements there was a new story about whatreally happened at Mayerling with Prince Rudolf of Hapsburg and his mis-tress, Marie Vetsera. Did they commit suicide in 1888 or didn’t they?” Withthat widespread interest in mind, this production was budgeted at the veryhefty for live television sum of $\$ 620,000$ , and while, just as on War andPeace, Audrey would receive a greater salary than Mel, the disparity this time

was not so great: Audrey would receive $150,000 and Mel $100,000.

The live telecast was set for February 4, 1957, but even with the esteemedAnatole Litvak directing, after three weeks of rehearsal, including five fulldays for the television crew, this Mayerling remained stubbornly inert. Onpaper, the appeal of the role proved easy to spot: Audrey would be playing abeautiful young woman who mingles with the highest levels of society anddances at the royal ball with her own Prince Charming. At age twenty-seven,Audrey could still pass for a teenager, there are beautiful costumes courtesyof Dorothy Jeakins, and even courtly dances staged by Marc Breaux of Soundof Music fame. But just as happened with the then married Elizabeth Taylorand Richard Burton in The Sandpiper and Hammersmith Is Out, Audrey andMel simply generated no heat together.

Making matters worse is the fact that in a production that runs only sev-enty-five minutes, audiences were forced to wait fifteen minutes for Audrey’sfirst appearance. Center stage is instead ceded to Mel, who unfortunatelyproves stiff in both body language and delivery. He is frequently dour, and asa result even Audrey appears a bit strained, mildly earthbound while playingopposite her real-life love.

Mel’s is a modern sensibility, and it’s hard to credit him as a nineteenth-century European aristocrat. He was not without talent as an actor, but whenall was said and done, he remained a bit of a cool customer for women in theviewing audience. That audience watched with the knowledge that Mel andAudrey were husband and wife in real life, but this pairing played out as aslightly unsettling live television rendering of A Star is Born, with a start-lingly talented younger wife eclipsing her older, more experienced husband.

The ratings were impressive—by some estimates as many as fifty millionwatched—and the production was actually released in theatres overseas, butthe critics remained unimpressed. In an acerbic yet not wholly inaccurate re-view, syndicated columnist Sheilah Graham laid it on the line: “The loversseemed more fated to bore each other to death than to end their illicit alliancein a murder-suicide pact.”

Even Audrey herself voiced frustration days after the airing: “I’m notsorry I did it. But television has certain drawbacks. We had only three weeksto rehearse—actually two weeks and four days—and much of the time wasconsumed by technicians. That isn’t enough time to put on a ninety-minuteplay.”

Audrey was right, but she was to be in more congenial territory—andmuch less rushed—with her next film, the effortlessly chic Funny Face.There might not have been a career with the Paris ballet in store for Audrey,but there would be a glorious Paris-set Technicolor Hollywood musical witha score by the Gershwins, a first-ever teaming with director Stanley Donen,and floating above the entire inspired outing, the greatest dancer of them all—Fred Astaire.

# Chapter SixteenBONJOUR, PARIS! 1956–1957

“Paris is always a good idea.”

—Audrey Hepburn

RIDING HIGH AFTER ROMAN HOLIDAY (1953) and the hugely popular Sabrina(1954), Audrey had let it be known that she’d “love to do a musical one day.”Enter Funny Face. Said Audrey: “I read it in Paris and I fell in love with it. Itwas a charming story.”

The charm of the story may have seemed effortless, but the task of bring-ing it to the screen more closely resembled the Hundred Years’ War. Origin-ally a 1920s Broadway musical starring Fred and Adele Astaire, Funny Facehad been completely revamped, and now featured a screenplay by LeonardGershe based upon his own unproduced movie Wedding Day. It had beenproducer Roger Edens’s inspired idea to combine Gershe’s script with Gersh-win music and lyrics, reasoning, accurately enough, that little could go wrongwith Stanley Donen, Audrey Hepburn, and the Gershwins. There was just onevery big problem: MGM owned both the rights to the script and the contractof producer Roger Edens, but Paramount held Audrey Hepburn’s contract.

A deal was struck: MGM would grant Paramount the Funny Face rightsand the services of the illustrious Roger Edens, in return for Paramount loan-ing out Audrey for a future film at MGM. In the end, Paramount ended upwith the beautiful Funny Face, and MGM with the monumental turkey GreenMansions, but that latter film lay two years in the future, and for now, bothstudios were pleased with the deal. As was Audrey, who, although under con-tract to Paramount, proved to be far from a mere pawn in the negotiations;said Roger Edens: “Miss Hepburn was all shrewd businesswoman till the dealwas signed by a long-drawn-out process, believe me.” Audrey’s salary?

75,000 pounds, along with a few other essentials: A suite at the Ritz Hotel inParis during location shooting. Per diem allowance. Permanent possession ofher Givenchy wardrobe. By the estimation of director Donen, when toting upthe cost of all the deals negotiated for actors, screenplay, and world-famousGershwin songs, $\$ 1$ million had been spent before a single frame had beenshot.

Audrey would here be cast as “Jo Stockton,” a self-serious young womanwho doesn’t believe that appearances matter until she arrives in Paris andmetamorphoses from bookstore clerk to photographer Dick Avery’s fashionmuse. Most important of all to Audrey, however, was the fact that DickAvery would be played by her dream co-star, Fred Astaire. Said Astaire:“They had her and she said, ‘well, I’ll do it if you get Fred Astaire.’ And thatwas the biggest compliment you can get, you know.” As eager to make thefilm as Audrey, Astaire even agreed to second billing.

Just as in Sabrina three years earlier, Audrey would here be playingCinderella to a much older man. She was twenty-seven to Astaire’s fifty-seven, but the thirty-year difference did not concern her in the slightest.Astaire, everyone agreed, was ageless. Not to mention possessing the abilityto dance circles around men thirty years his junior. Said Audrey: “Who careshow old he is? He’s Fred Astaire! And if anyone doesn’t like it, he can gojump in the lake.”

In fact, inside Audrey’s humorous comment lies an essential truth: herpairings here with Astaire and seven years later with the twenty-five yearsolder Cary Grant, worked because both men appeared to be just as sophistic-ated as she, and even more importantly, possessed the same abundant charmthat made audiences believe in the possibility of happily ever after. SaidAudrey in later years: “Was Fred good looking? I think so, because charm isthe best-looking thing in the world, isn’t it?”

The film’s technical advisor, famed fashion photographer Richard Ave-don, actually served as the inspiration for the character of Dick Avery, whileAudrey’s character was based in part upon famed model Dorcas “Doe” Nor-well, Avedon’s first wife. For a fee of $\$ 10,000$ , the world-famous Avedonwould provide the title credits and backgrounds, tips on lighting, and thefilm’s cutting edge freeze-frame photographs. Avedon, who had always idol-ized Astaire, smilingly related: “I learned how to be me by pretending to behim,” before adding, “then I had to teach him how to pretend to be me.”

With the start of official rehearsals looming, and the Academy Award–winning Audrey feeling as nervous as a schoolgirl at the mere thought of dan-cing with Astaire, she began rehearsing with dance director Eugene Loring.Feeling, in her own words, that “it’s every woman’s dream to dance withFred Astaire,” Audrey later recalled their first rehearsal together: “One lookat this most debonair and elegant and distinguished of legends, and I couldfeel myself turn into solid lead while my heart sank into my two left feet.”Astaire, sensing her nerves, gently smiled: “Come on, let’s have a little go to-gether.” Audrey’s reaction: “It was such fun, it was so divine.” The sensememory of the thrill lingered for decades: “. . . suddenly I felt a hand aroundmy waist, and with his inimitable grace and lightness Fred literally swept meoff my feet.”

The two perfectionists proved kindred spirits: “He gave me such confid-ence. We practiced a lot, which is an understatement. For hours, and hours,and hours, and hours, and hours. . . .With that wonderful nonchalance of his,you didn’t want it to end.” The ever-chic Audrey was even a bit in awe of theway the uber dapper Astaire dressed for rehearsals: impeccably groomed andwearing a pair of gray flannel slacks which were often belted with a necktie.So taken was Audrey with Fred’s style that she asked her co-star for a photo-graph of himself, and, following her own flawless instincts for effortlessstyle, had a gray flannel frame custom made for the photo.

Shooting began in Hollywood in April of 1956, followed by a month oflocation filming in Paris. And if money was going to be spent filming inParis, then all of Paris was going to be utilized: the film would feature nofewer than thirty-five locations, from the Louvre and Eiffel Tower to NotreDame and the Arc de Triomphe. For Audrey, it was to be Paris experiencedwhile decked out in a wardrobe by Givenchy, one that would provide herwith the biggest fashion statement yet of her burgeoning career. In fact, al-though the credit of “Miss Hepburn’s Paris Wardrobe by Hubert deGivenchy” would seem to imply that her clothes for the New York City se-quences were designed by Paramount’s Edith Head, Stanley Donen re-membered that even those clothes were Givenchy’s.

Analyzed fashion author Pamela Clarke Keogh of this quintessential Hep-burn-Givenchy collaboration: “They were two very special individuals. Thetalent was so unique it was almost like gold. You can’t reduce it, can’t take itaway, you can’t refine it—it is what it is.” Or, in the words of designer Jef-

frey Banks: “They were both modern masters of their métier.”

There was to be far more than the dazzling clothes on display however,because Audrey at long last would be able to fulfill her deep desire to appearin a musical, singing classic Gershwin songs in her own small but effectivemezzo soprano (“Soft, gentle, but dear” in the words of Stanley Donen). Bestof all as far as Audrey was concerned: she would have no fewer than threeopportunities to dance with Fred Astaire, on the songs “Funny Face,” “Bon-jour, Paris!” and the film ending “S’Wonderful.” In Sean Ferrer’s beautifullyjudged phrase: “She took off on a dance whirlwind that had been bottled upfor years.”

About her musical numbers:

“How Long Has This Been Going On”—Jo would be discovered clerkingin a drab Manhattan bookstore. Minions from Quality magazine descend onthe store to stage a fashion shoot, wreaking havoc before leaving as quicklyas they arrived. Beginning to clean up their mess while alone in a dark, dustyroom, Audrey begins to sing “How Long Has This Been Going On” in asweet voice at once intimate and confiding. Donen, collaborating with cine-matographer Ray June, filmed the number utilizing high angles, with Audreyhalf in darkness, the yellow and orange scarf she wrapped around her hat theonly daub of color in the frame. Evocative, painterly, and character definingall at once.

“Basal Metabolism”—Audrey in head-to-toe black, dancing in a nightcluband mocking the beatnik culture of the day, all while delivering a terrificroutine which shows off her still-beautiful line. In control, even when cuttingloose.

Her outfit: a high-necked black sweater paired with slim-fitting blackpants, a look still copied today. No one may think of copying fashions fromdozens of terrific 1940s and ’50s musicals produced by the famed Freed Unitat MGM, but it’s a fact of style that Audrey’s Funny Face look captivates inthe twenty-first century as easily as it did in 1957.

That chic look, however, came with its own set of problems, and provedthe source of a rare, heated dispute between star and director. Donen insistedthat the black sweater and fitted black pants be topped off by white socks, thebetter to draw attention to her light, fast footwork. Audrey wanted to be cladentirely in black from head to toe—black socks, not white. In the retelling,Donen insisted that Audrey cried over the socks. Audrey disagreed emphatic-

ally while adding: “But what I did not tell Stanley until years later was thatthere was something he did not realize at the time about why I was so upset.You see, as a little girl I had a terrible complex about my big feet—I weareight and a half—and I’d grown up with ballerinas who were little things.” Agreat Hollywood star was now living out her fantasies by dancing withAstaire, but the little girl who felt white socks would draw attention to her ga-lumphing feet was now, and forever after, present. The feeling never didleave, and even while promoting her 1987 television movie Love AmongThieves, when asked if she would change anything about her appearance,Audrey immediately responded: “I’d like to have had smaller feet. Myfriends have pretty feet and wear such pretty shoes.” Such feelings of self-consciousness could not have been helped by Ella’s comment, instantly re-called by Audrey, in that same interview: “Years ago my mother said Ilooked like Olive Oyl—thin legs and big feet.”

Feelings were hurt by the disagreement with Donen, until Audrey saw arough cut of the number and sent her director a note: “You were right aboutthe socks.” As the sometimes-curmudgeonly Donen admitted in later years:“When she realized you appreciated her gifts and were doing all in yourpower to make her look as good as possible—and with Audrey that was very,very good—she entrusted herself to you completely. I admit, though, it wassomething she made you earn.”

For all of her nerves, Audrey was having a great time in her make-believeworld: High fashion. Gershwin. Fred Astaire. Even her mother got into theact—look quickly, and yes, that is Baroness Ella van Heemstra in the role ofa sidewalk café customer. A family affair.

Highlighting the location shooting was a tour de force trip around Pariswith Audrey/Jo photographed by Astaire/Avery in a succession of dazzlingGivenchy creations:

Audrey all in black chasing balloons in the Tuileries. Even the inevitablelocation shoot accidents seemed to aid the film: it rained during the film-ing of this sequence, yet the rain falling among the gently floating um-brellas somehow made it look all the more special, like a delirious Tech-nicolor dream. Everyone’s best idea of Paris.

Audrey sporting white pedal pushers while fishing on the Seine. In thewords of Jeffrey Banks: “The white pants, the little cropped top and pink

sash—it was slightly bohemian, very chic—and very Audrey Hepburn.”

Ingenuity proved the order of the day when it came time to capture this tourde force sequence in freeze frames. Instead of facing the normal freeze-framedistortion which occurs when a frame is printed repeatedly, Donen solved theproblem by placing a two-way mirror over the lens; the movie camera thenshot through the mirror “while Avedon focused on the mirror, and the lablater matched the still photo with the film frame.” This was all ahead of itstime—experimenting with freeze frames and negative still photos was notstandard 1950s movie musical fare—but the catch-you-by-surprise techniqueis one of many reasons why the film has held up so beautifully over the dec-ades.

Yes, the “Bonjour, Paris!” number was certainly splashy and fun, but whataudiences remember most vividly sixty years on is the extraordinary se-quence of Audrey materializing from behind the statue of “Winged Victory”;swathed in a strapless red chiffon evening gown, diamond necklace glitteringaround her throat and red shawl floating behind her, she runs, no, skims,down the white marble staircase as the melody of “Funny Face” waftsthrough the air. Arms held high, simultaneously hurrying and floating—thisis one Cinderella at the ball who stuns the prince. The ugly duckling has be-come a swan among swans, melding style with substance in a joyful elegancethat seems at once both otherworldly and yet surprisingly accessible. Runningdown the sweeping Daru staircase, she joyfully cries out “I don’t want to stopit. I like it! Take the picture. Take the picture. Take the picture!” (With typ-ical modesty Audrey recalled: “I did it once and I didn’t break my neck. Justgood luck. I could not look down.”) Yes, all credit to cinematographer RayJune, whose lighting brilliantly contrasts the statue, the rich red gown, andthe white opera-length gloves, but nearly seventy years later this showstop-ping moment remains pure Audrey. Gorgeously sophisticated yet full of funand laughter. Unique.

Funny Face’s fairy-tale plot was capped by a film-ending wedding at anineteenth-century Chantilly hunting lodge—complete with swans. It’s theonly time in Audrey’s filmography where she’s filmed wearing a weddingdress, her chic femininity all the more noticeable when compared with the de-liberately androgynous black outfit she sports when dancing “Basal Metabol-ism.” Says Jeffrey Banks of that wedding dress: “It had a dropped torso, and

it was not floor length. It was very daring for its time and yet it’s timeless.People still want to look like that fifty years later.”

Just to complete the misty-water-colored memory, it’s not just the swanswho float on the water—so too do Hepburn and Astaire, off to the far horizonon a raft surrounded by the swans. At which point the realization hits that allof Audrey’s fairy-tale endings prove appealing precisely because of their oft-times surprising complexity: In Roman Holiday she forsakes love for thethrone, in Sabrina Prince Charming turns out to be a grumpy older man in theperson of Humphrey Bogart, and in My Fair Lady the future remains ambigu-ous. Only here in Funny Face was she provided with a true fairy-tale ending,blissfully floating away with Fred Astaire.

Happily ever after.

Except.

Kay Thompson, playing “Maggie Prescott” (a character based upon Vogueeditor Diana Vreeland) took a slightly more jaundiced view of the filming,particularly that ethereal ending. Two straight weeks of rain had turned theground to thick, goopy mud, and in the brittle yet effective Thompson’stelling, it had also turned Fred Astaire into a demanding fussbudget. Angular,talented, and a bit of a bulldozer, Thompson shared a mutual respect withAstaire, but in the end, they remained two artists who simply did not matchup as people. In her recall, Astaire grew increasingly impatient about themuddy conditions, bluntly informing Donen: “I can’t dance in that. Fix it. . . .Put down a wood floor and paint it green.” Even more, she claimed, Astairegrew querulous with Audrey while filming on the raft, snapping at her:“What are you doing?”

So severe were the muddy conditions that Audrey had no fewer than ninepairs of white satin dancing pumps made in Paris, with the continuous rainmaking each pair progressively dirtier and more unusable. In Thompson’sversion of events, as Astaire grew grumpier, she counseled Audrey to “re-member the camera is on you and whatever he says is unimportant. Don’tlisten.” Claimed Thompson, Audrey responded to her counsel by replying:“Yes, well, it is a bit of a strain.” Audrey’s own genteel retelling provides adifferent take on any possible contretemps with Astaire: “I never saw himcross, never. I’ve never even heard he was difficult.”

In the end, the two women simply possessed very different recall of theevents, but Thompson only had praise for Audrey, calling her “very serious.

There was no coziness, no demanding to speak to Stanley on the side, nosecret conversations, no anything like that.” Whichever version is accurate,what is indisputable is that Audrey broke the tension over the mud by quip-ping: “Here I have waited twenty years to dance with Fred Astaire, and whatdo I get? Mud!” A smiling Astaire recalled the quip as “my favorite remarkof all time.”

Whatever Kay Thompson’s opinion, Hepburn, Astaire, and Donen hit itoff remarkably well, and in a nicely written puff piece which appeared threedays before the opening of the film, Donen opined: “It soon became apparentto me in directing the new Paramount musical Funny Face that Miss Hep-burn, who co-stars with Fred Astaire, has the disturbing facility of doingeverything so well that it almost seems a shame ever to let the camera leaveher.”

Astaire’s reaction to his director offering such fulsome praise only forAudrey remains unknown, but of his pairing with Audrey there can be nodoubt. Their lithe bodies, the seemingly lighter-than-air charm that both pos-sess, help each of them complete the other. She reassures him of his contin-ued vitality, just as he is effectively telling her: “Yes, you really can dance.”If, in Sabrina, Audrey seemed to possess two times the energy of HumphreyBogart, in Funny Face Astaire proves a match for her every step of the way.

In a strange bit of advertising, the print ads for the film’s February 13,1957, premiere featured Audrey in the black “Basal Metabolism” outfit underthe headline: “Audrey’s Hep!” There is no mention of Hollywood’s leadingfashion icon swanning through Paris in Givenchy. No touting of the danceswith Astaire or even the music of Gershwin. Critical reception nonethelessproved highly favorable, with Film and Filming terming it “the most originalscreen musical since Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and possibly the mostenjoyable since Singin’ in the Rain.” Perhaps the ad copy threw people off,because the initial box office reception proved nothing more than mildly fa-vorable for a film which has now firmly attained the rank of cult classic.

Cult classic or not, the ever-critical André Previn positioned himself asone of the few dissenters, terming the film: “Too chic . . . I didn’t think it hadany muscle in it. It was all so precious.” Most, however, agreed with FrankSinatra: “[Working with Audrey] is still an unfulfilled ambition of mine.She’s the kind of girl you know mother would love, the kind they build mu-sicals around.”

In a number of ways, Funny Face remains the film which speaks most in-tensely to the joy in performing which Audrey sought and here actually ob-tained. If Breakfast at Tiffany’s is the film people most prominently associatewith Audrey, it is Funny Face which speaks to her essential screen self, mix-ing the largest fashion show of her film career with the biggest artistic love ofher life—dancing. That she was singing Gershwin and dancing with Astaireproved the icing on the cake. Said the New York Times, “Miss Hepburn hasthe meek charm of a wallflower turned into a rueful butterfly.”

It’s a nicely turned phrase, one which reaches to the very essence ofAudrey Hepburn onscreen, because there proved to be no more glorious sightthan this particular Cinderella-in-waiting transforming into a butterfly. Thatshe remained rueful in the process, acknowledging her own vulnerabilityamidst her triumph, made viewers around the world love her even more. Asthose audiences now realized, there simply was no one else like her.

# Chapter SeventeenLOVE IN THE AFTERNOON, 1957

“An over-long and only spasmodically amusing romantic comedy . . .”

—Geoff Andrew, Time Out

AFTER COMPLETING FUNNY FACE, AND following four weeks’ vacation in Bürgen-stock, Audrey began shooting Love in the Afternoon in August 1956.

Forever sad about her father’s disappearance, Audrey was here once againgravitating toward the idea/figure of a decidedly older man in her choice ofmaterial. The most prominent motif present in these early films was not thefact of romance itself but rather the presence of that significantly older maleas her love interest, a protective father figure capable of providing room inwhich to spread her wings. Romantic, yes, but always with an undercurrent oftemporal sadness.

What was it about the Hepburn screen persona which made writers anddirectors alike concoct films which were not just battles of the sexes but,even more noticeably, skirmishes between the generations? Was it her youth-ful appearance and air of schoolgirl innocence? Was Audrey herself attractedto such films as an attempt to recreate her own missing father-daughter rela-tionship? (Barbra Streisand did precisely that in her directorial and screen-writing debut, 1983’s Yentl.) Or was it simply the case of a savvy new Holly-wood star realizing exactly what her audiences wanted to see? Whatever thereason, and it mostly likely was a combination of all three, when approachedby Billy Wilder shortly after their smashing success with Sabrina, Audreyhad immediately said yes to Love in the Afternoon.

Here was the first-ever soon-to-become-famous collaboration betweenBilly Wilder and his new writing partner, I. A. L. Diamond. Based upon theClaude Anet novel Ariane, the story for Love in the Afternoon had already

been filmed in both German (Ariane, 1931) and French (Ariane, jeune fillerusse, 1932). Wilder, however, was so determined to cast Audrey in the lead-ing role of this new version that he had sent her a cable in December 1954explaining that he wanted to buy the rights to Ariane but would not commitwithout her promise to star in the film. Read the telegram: “Ariane withoutyou unthinkable.” Eager to work with Wilder again, and happy at the pro-spect of filming at the Studios de Boulogne in Paris, Audrey signed on for thefilm a full year before it was to begin production, committing herself to themovie before she had even begun filming War and Peace.

Love in the Afternoon, whose plot bore more than a passing resemblanceto the Wilder-scripted Bluebird’s Eighth Wife, found Audrey playing Ariane,the schoolgirlish daughter of Claude Chavasse (Maurice Chevalier). Whilestill living with her father, Ariane develops a hopeless crush upon the mucholder womanizing American business tycoon Frank Flanagan and attempts tointerest the high-living Flanagan by inventing a nonexistent romantic past.

And who would play Ariane’s love interest, a paragon of masculine appealold enough to be Ariane’s father? Cary Grant (fifty-two years old) proved un-available. So too did Yul Brynner (at forty-one, Brynner was thirteen yearsolder than Audrey). Thoughts then turned to Gary Cooper, who at fifty-fivewas only three years older than Grant (and five years older than Wilder him-self.) Cooper was still a very big star, a recent winner of the Best Actor Oscarfor High Noon (1952), and he quickly expressed interest in the role. Just onebig obstacle loomed: Gary Cooper looked every one of his fifty-five years—and then some.

That problem becomes immediately apparent upon Cooper’s first, long-delayed (thirty minutes) entrance into the film. Still handsome but filmed inheavy shadows which can’t fully disguise the bags under his eyes, Cooper isalways a welcome sight onscreen, but viewers could not help but be distrac-ted by Wilder’s overt use of filters. Echoing the technique he had utilized infilming Humphrey Bogart, he here employs the same plethora of shots frombehind Cooper’s shoulders. There may still be heat generated in the close-upsof Cooper and Hepburn together, but the age discrepancy becomes more ofan issue here than it ever was with Astaire or Bogart, precisely because of thefilmmakers’ strenuous efforts to distract viewers from what is staring themright in the face. Cooper looks nothing so much as tired, an essentially shybut genuinely nice man who seems a bit fatigued, wondering, perhaps, what

all the fuss is about. If he wonders, then so too does the audience, and as aresult, his aw-shucks charm proves harder than usual to swallow.

Decades later, Wilder himself admitted that this casting lay at the heart ofthe film’s problem: “But the mistake there was that my beloved friend GaryCooper, whom I miss terribly, was the wrong casting, you know? . . . He pho-tographed like a decent, tough marshal from High Noon.”

It’s not that Cooper and Audrey didn’t like each other or find an easygoingrapport. In fact, the veteran Cooper pronounced himself smitten: “I’ve beenin pictures over thirty years, but I’ve never had a more exciting leading ladythan Audrey. She puts more life and energy into her acting than anyone I’veever met.” The affection proved mutual, with Audrey, not someone associ-ated with the ethos of the Friars Club, even participating in a Friar’s Clubroast of Cooper on January 9, 1961, four months before the actor’s death.Listening to the reaction of the crowd, it’s almost as if Audrey’s mere pres-ence makes the boozed-up, blue-humored participants straighten up and flyright; eschewing the typical Friar’s Club brand of biting and often X-ratedhumor, Audrey contributed her own gentle poem, entitled “What Is a GaryCooper?” In a series of rhyming stanzas, she extolled the actor’s virtues, enu-merating:

It’s cheerful, charming

Charitable and disarming

Bewitching, unaffected,

Enriching and unexpected.

Great as the affection between Audrey and Cooper was, however, theproblem onscreen lay in the fact that the much more believable relationshipon display was that between Audrey and her screen father Chevalier, the twoactors exuding a similar and decidedly continental sophistication. In the caseof Chevalier, however, the eye-catching surface hid a decidedly shallow in-terior, and in the words of Billy Wilder’s wife Audrey Wilder: “His onlytopic of conversation from morning to night was himself.”

Chevalier, in fact, figured prominently in a fascinating “what if” momentthat occurred during filming, when Alan Jay Lerner stopped by the set to dis-cuss a planned musical film adaptation of Gigi. Lerner, who was writing the

screenplay as well as the lyrics, inquired if Chevalier was interested in therole of the older roue Honoré Lachaille? And more to the point, was Audreyinterested in recreating her star-making role—and in a Lerner and Lowe, Vin-cente Minnelli–directed, MGM Technicolor extravaganza to boot? Audrey’sresponse proved typically polite and thoughtful, but negative. At twenty-eightshe felt she was too old for the role, and the part was ultimately played withgreat success by Audrey’s near doppelganger, Leslie Caron, whose singingwas largely dubbed, albeit with none of the attendant controversy thatswamped Audrey seven years later on My Fair Lady.

By the time filming began on what was now her fifth starring role, Audreyhad developed enough onscreen skills to make you believe in her relation-ships with both papa Chevalier and ladies’ man Cooper. She may have ex-uded an air of girlishness, but she still displayed a maturity that allowed herto go toe to toe with the scene-stealing Chevalier and the revered Cooper.Audrey made her onscreen romances with older men work because she con-veyed the idea that no matter how youthful her character, she was a youngwoman who wanted to be treated as an equal. Said Billy Wilder: “She made itso clear that her acting partners had to react the proper way. She drew theminto reality.”

Romantically eager in her pursuit of Flanagan yet never bulldozer strong,Audrey’s Ariane was sensitive yet full of self-confidence, a combinationwhich allowed audiences to feel genuinely protective while rooting for hersuccess. Just as moviegoers agreed with Spencer Tracy’s assessment of Kath-arine Hepburn in Pat and Mike—“Not much meat on her . . . [but] what’sthere is cherce”—they here agree with Flanagan’s response when Audreyenumerates a seemingly autobiographical list of Ariane’s faults: “I’m too thinand my ears stick out and my teeth are crooked and my neck’s much toolong.” Cooper’s smiling reply? “Maybe so—but I love the way it all hangstogether.” To the delight of audiences everywhere, it was the male characters—not only Frank Flanagan in Love in the Afternoon but also Joe Bradley inRoman Holiday, Linus Larrabee in Sabrina, and even Henry Higgins in MyFair Lady—who would act as fairy godfathers in the emergence of eachfilm’s beautiful young Cinderella-like character played by Audrey.

Perhaps if Cooper were ten years younger, or if the role of Frank Flanaganhad been played by Cary Grant with his studied nonchalance and unbeatablecharm, it might have worked. The problem, however, lies not only with

Cooper but in the very concept at the heart of the film. Frank Flanagan is notjust more than twice Ariane’s age—he’s off-putting in his pride that he for-gets the names of his previous amorous conquests. Is he a charming rascal or,more likely, a full-fledged male chauvinist?

Struggling to overcome this desultory premise, the film remains unbal-anced, with Audrey and Chevalier supplying charm but Cooper inspiring anoccasional sense of unease. Flickering to life only intermittently, the filmmoves in fits and starts, and at two hours and ten minutes proves at leasttwenty minutes too long. And yet, there are several moments in the filmwhich display the patented Wilder touch, most notably Audrey’s silent dancewith her cello, a dance which gracefully explains both Ariane’s musical stud-ies as well as her private character and fantasies.

The problem, however, remains in the fact that for every amusing momentof a mood-setting string quartet following Flanagan into the Turkish bath,there is a stretched-to-the-breaking-point gag about Ariane trying to hide herinterest in Flanagan from her father. Even when the trademark Wilder humorbegins to take off, any sensible viewer is yanked out of emotional involve-ment with the realization that for an unemployed student, Ariane appears tobe awfully well-off; how is a mere student able to afford the Givenchy outfitsshe sports in each scene? (The same question pops into the head of anyonewatching Sabrina, but it simply doesn’t matter, such is the charm of thatfilm.)

Love in the Afternoon does recapture some lost ground with a wonderfulfinale in which the towering Cooper sweeps Audrey up and onto a train hurt-ling out of Paris. In later years, however, Wilder related the interesting storythat his good friend William Wyler told him that Audrey’s character shouldnot have spoken to Cooper as his train was departing at film’s end: “Wylersaid, ‘Make it silent.’ But I couldn’t because her lips were moving.” Asked ifhe would have made the finale silent if he could have, Wilder explains: “Yes.I would have had her start to follow and then he leaves, then she runs parallelwith the train, and then he grabs her. But I had too many words there . . .she’s already said goodbye to him. She should shut up at the moment andshould just keep running, and then he grabs her.”

As it turned out, even the inspired finale caused its own share of contro-versy, with the still powerful Legion of Decency threatening a “C” for “Con-demned” rating if the unmarried Ariane and Flanagan rode off into the dis-

tance together; as a result, instead of a wordless final shot of Cooper sweep-ing her up onto the train, Chevalier now announced in voiceover: “They arenow married, serving a life sentence in New York.” The tagline, however,succeeded only in nudging the film toward a “B” rating: “Morally objection-able in part for all.”

Yes, Love in the Afternoon proved amusing in its cynicism, but only inter-mittently so, with nearly all of the scattered moments of charm supplied byAudrey, who received a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Motion PicturesActress, Musical/Comedy. Her star brand may have been slightly dinged bythe film’s shaky virtues, but for now it remained unassailable.

In the end, the film sputtered at the box office, eking out a mediocre grossthat did not return a profit to Allied Artists. In the early 1980s, the idea of aLove in the Afternoon remake starring the then popular Nastassja Kinski wasbruited about, and although Wilder and Diamond were not sure who couldplay the male lead, they liked the idea. However, when Wilder’s last everfilm, Buddy, Buddy (1981), failed at the box office, all talk of a Love in theAfternoon remake disappeared.

Love in the Afternoon had not reproduced the Hepburn-Wilder magicfound in Sabrina, but studios still wanted to be in the Audrey Hepburn busi-ness, and with Mel continuing to play an important part in deciding whichfilms she would make, a new joint Hepburn-Ferrer movie was now proposed.It was, however, one with a caveat: How about a feature film starring Audrey,but with Mel in the director’s chair rather than onscreen as co-star? Mel, itturned out, had just the project in mind—an exotic extravaganza titled GreenMansions.

# Chapter Eighteen

# FEATURE FILM MISTAKE #1—GREEN MAN-

# SIONS, 1958–1959

“Filmization of W. H. Hudson’s novel has been approached with reverenceand taste but fantastic elements puzzle and annoy.”

—Variety

BASED UPON W. H. HUDSON’S 1904 novel of the same name, Green Mansionswas to star Audrey as Rima, a naïve habitue of the jungle who lives with hergrandfather and the wild animals who serve as her only companions. Thisonce popular, and very strange story—a jungle-land version of Audrey’sTony Award–winning role as the sea-dwelling Ondine—was now beingturned into a multimillion-dollar Hollywood feature for one reason only:Audrey Hepburn had agreed to star in the film.

A story of gauzy mysticism, Green Mansions had been bruited about forthe big screen as far back as the 1930s, when it was first proposed as a starvehicle for Dolores del Rio. Two decades later, it had been talked up onceagain, this time as a feature film for the delicate Pier Angeli. Neither versioncame close to production, but MGM, Mel, and Audrey all chose to ignore thewarning signals that the story’s gossamer tone seemed ill suited to the in-terests of a more demanding postwar moviegoing audience. In the novelRima is depicted as both younger and wilder than Audrey, but Audrey’spreternatural grace of movement did seem to make her the only actress any-one would accept as a fawnlike innocent; unfortunately, no one seemed tostop and ask the most basic of questions: who exactly wanted to see the beau-tiful Audrey Hepburn wearing a sackcloth outfit while playing a queen of thejungle?

But with Mel fixated upon the Cinderella-of-the-jungle story, and with his

ironclad belief that he could guide Audrey to a fully realized performance,the studio expressed interest. Granted, none of the black-and-white featurefilms Mel directed had turned out to be hits—not Vendetta, The Secret Fury,or Girl of the Limberlost—but then again, none of those films had starredAudrey Hepburn in Technicolor. The studio acquiesced—Green Mansionswould complete the Funny Face/Paramount/MGM quid pro quo agreed totwo years earlier—and a $\$ 3$ million budget was granted.

Off Mel went to Latin America to film background footage and scout pro-spective locations. The jungle locales he found proved undeniably beautiful,but they were also deemed too inaccessible for the physical requirements of amajor Hollywood production. A decision was made: although some of thatbackground footage would be incorporated into the final film, the movie it-self would be shot in Hollywood, with large portions of the MGM backlot be-ing turned into a jungle, courtesy of art director Preston Ames.

Ames utilized hundreds of plants that Mel had shipped back from his LatinAmerican trip to turn football-stadium-sized areas of the MGM back lot intoa jungle playground for Audrey/Rima and her pet deer. Mansions producerEdmund Grainger had in fact spoken with Clarence Brown, director of TheYearling, about his experiences dealing with that film’s deer, and it wasBrown who suggested that a deer be adopted by Audrey right after its birth;with Audrey bottle-feeding the fawn, the deer would look upon Audrey as itsactual mother. Such a plan would likely never pass muster in the animal-safety-conscious Hollywood of the twenty-first century, but in the late 1950s,anything was deemed possible when it came to a star of Audrey’s stature.Adopt the fawn she did, naming him Ip, after the sound he made while call-ing for attention.

Down the line, there would be regrets about this adoption, because as Ipgrew to full size, it became clear that a new home would have to be found forhim at a zoo. Seeing and hearing how Ip cried when she left, Audrey realizedthat she had made a mistake in domesticating a wild animal—“She never for-gave herself,” reported her son Luca. That particular trauma lay severalmonths in the future, however, and for now, as the start of filming drew near,wherever Audrey went, so too did Ip. When Audrey and Mel ate in the diningroom of their well-appointed rental home, Ip would eat in the dining roomright along with them. Sleeping accommodations? No problem at all: WhileAudrey and Mel slept in their bedroom, Ip would simply sleep in the adjacent

bathroom.

Ip did indeed now think of Audrey as his mother, and as the press contin-ued to refer to Audrey as faunlike and the possessor of doe eyes, there werenow snapshots of mother and fawn cavorting in the backyard or shopping to-gether in a Beverly Hills supermarket. It proves even more surprising, then,to watch Green Mansions and realize how little footage of Ip made it into thefinal film. All that time Audrey spent with Ip seemed to result in nothingmore than three minutes of screen time.

But it was not the exact timing of Ip’s footage that proved of primary con-cern during filming. Instead, it was Audrey, ever her own worst critic, whogrew very upset with the first week’s footage. Feeling that the much wider ra-tio (2.33 to 1) of the film’s CinemaScope process only emphasized what sheconsidered the shortcomings of her square features, Audrey, in her best iron-fist-inside-a-velvet-glove-fashion, let it be known that MGM must fix the dis-torted images—pronto. Emergency calls were put out, and Robert E. Gott-schalk, the original developer of the anamorphic lens, brought his own brand-new lens to MGM and shot test footage. Gottschalk, MGM fixer-in-chief Ed-die Mannix, Audrey, and Mel assembled in the screening room to watch thisnewly shot footage, and when the Panavision camera closed in on Audrey’sface as she peered out from behind jungle foliage, a collective sigh of reliefwas followed by a round of applause. The lens difficulties had been solved;now it was just the story itself that began growing into an ever-larger prob-lem.

In the finished film, audiences are denied a glimpse of Audrey until a fulltwenty-eight minutes have elapsed, and her first words are not uttered untilforty minutes into the film’s one hour and forty-four minutes running time.So uninvolving is the drama, so nonexistent the chemistry between Audreyand leading man Anthony Perkins (“Abel”), that the viewer is left to idlywonder how Rima keeps her one and only outfit so pristinely clean andpressed in the middle of the jungle. Perkins, three years younger than Audrey,is himself too much of a naif to provide any contrast to Audrey, and while heliked Audrey a great deal—“She was wonderful to work with, like a real per-son, almost a sister”—he was saddled with lines which would stymie Olivierhimself, squeaking out “I’ve got to live!” as a high point of emotion. Eventhe film’s thundering score by Bronislau Kaper distracts, underlining everyforced emotion several times, just in case any youngster in the audience

missed the point.

Mel’s direction registers as competent, but his decision to regularly utilizea green tint proves disorienting. While the footage from his trip to LatinAmerica is impressive, noticeably artificial sets representing the cave ofRima’s grandfather Nuflo (a hammy Lee J. Cobb) further add to audiencedisconnection. Perhaps the film might have fared better back in the ’30s whenit was first mentioned as a possible feature, but sophisticated 1950s audiencesweren’t buying this particular brand of whimsy.

Tony Perkins felt that the film failed commercially “because it was goodbut unusual,” but Sean Ferrer provides the most nuanced take on why his par-ents’ film didn’t score: “In some ways it seems like more of an idea than afully realized story. My father didn’t get the budget to really sell it and theyhad to make do with big plants on a studio set—those sets look artificial andpull you out of the fantasy. The story seems a bit stale, but they also didn’t letmy father take it as far as he could have. And maybe he had doubts and didn’thave the courage to take the material all the way.”

For nearly two hours the audience watches Rima run around the junglewhile trying to find true love with Abel, yet in the end she is killed, only toreappear as a cross between a flower and an apparition. Where exactly wasthe audience for an Audrey Hepburn film in which she plays a jungle spiritwho is burned alive at the climax? It’s a denouement to which the only lo-gical reaction is “Huh? Audrey’s dead but now she’s a flower?!” Audienceswere not impressed, and neither were the critics. Even Audrey’s fan BosleyCrowther struggled for words of praise, only managing to write: “Even so,Miss Hepburn conducts herself all through it with grace and dignity, makingRima both poignant and idyllic, if not in the least logical.” More typically,however, “D.B.” in Monthly Film Bulletin bluntly stated: “A piece of irritat-ing and often risible hokum.”

The film flopped, and Mel Ferrer never again directed either Audrey or aHollywood feature film. Noting the failure of Green Mansions, as well as thelackluster Mayerling, Paramount did not exercise its option on three otherproposed Hepburn/Ferrer films: Thomas Wolfe’s Look Homeward, Angel andJean Anouilh’s The Lark, as well as a Ferrer-directed version of $L$ ’Aiglon.Mel’s dream of teaming with Audrey to become the postwar version of theOliviers was fading fast, the score for their five years/four joint projects fall-ing far below their hoped-for goal:

Ondine—A Tony Award for Audrey, grumblings about Mel’s misplacedego.

War and Peace—Praise for Audrey but indifference toward Mel.

Mayerling—Nobody’s idea of a good time.

Green Mansions—Best forgotten by everyone involved.

But while Green Mansions may have failed financially, Audrey’s star wassoon to reach its zenith with the next year’s release of an extraordinary film,one which contained the finest acting of her career. The performance, in fact,that Audrey preferred over any other in her filmography.

Audrey Kathleen Hepburn, the ultimate fashion icon, would be trading inGivenchy for the habit of a cloistered nun.

# Chapter NineteenTHE NUN’S STORY, 1959

“A transcendent film, comparable more to Bergman or Bresson than toanything in the American cinema.”

—John Fitzpatrick

FRESH OFF THE FAILURE OF Green Mansions and still desperately wanting achild, Audrey looked at work as a welcome distraction from her personal dis-appointments. If she couldn’t yet have a family of her own, she would stillhave a chance to stretch her acting muscles with a role as far from her normalscreen fare as possible: that of a young woman who enters the cloisteredworld of the convent, only to experience a life-altering crisis of faith. TheNun’s Story.

Based upon the best-selling novel of the same name by Kathryn Hulme,The Nun’s Story told the story of the real-life Marie Louise Habets (herenamed Gabrielle van der Mal), who was known as Sister Luke after takingthe veil. Audrey had first become aware of the book when her sister-in-lawenthusiastically recommended it to Mel, who immediately saw the story as anopportunity for Audrey to expand her range as an actress; when the idea of amovie based upon Hulme’s novel had first been broached, it was pitched as avehicle for Ingrid Bergman, who was now back in public favor after the scan-dal of her out-of-wedlock pregnancy with Italian director Roberto Rossellini.Bergman, however, felt she was too old for the role and suggested Audrey toplay Sister Luke.

The movie’s screenwriter, Robert Anderson, was immediately interestedin the idea of casting Audrey and asked his agent Kay Brown to callAudrey’s agent Kurt Frings. Audrey was intrigued, quickly realizing that An-derson, famous for his play Tea and Sympathy, had written a psychologically

complex script of surprising depth. (As it turned out, Anderson and Audreyhad a discreet and relatively short-term personal involvement that he wroteabout, in slightly disguised fashion, in his novel After.)

Anderson’s first-rate screenplay considered issues of faith against a back-ground stretching from a sheltered convent to Africa, and from 1920s Bel-gium to the Europe of World War II. Here was a script that grappled withnothing less than the biggest of questions—in the striking words of Hillelutilized by Anderson in his screenplay: “If I am not for myself, who will befor me? And if I am for myself alone, what am I?”

Audrey felt an immediate kinship with the character of Sister Luke: bothwomen were born in Belgium, lost their fathers at a young age, left their nat-ive countries, experienced suffering during the Second World War whileworking for the underground, and had brothers sent to labor camps during thewar. Sean believes that what attracted Audrey to the part was the chance toinvestigate the life of “someone who had the courage to choose humanityover ideology. The system of ideology was preventing the nun from doingwhat she really wanted her life to be about—helping people. That struck achord with my mother. . . . I think the experience of filming parts of Nun’sStory in Africa also helped plant the seeds of her UNICEF work later in life.”

Gabrielle’s onscreen journey would take her from privileged Belgianschoolgirl to cloistered nun before she grows disillusioned and leaves the or-der. This was all far from the world of The Sound of Music or even Dialogueof the Carmelites; in the words of the film’s Oscar-winning director Fred Zin-nemann (From Here to Eternity, 1953), Sister Luke’s story was “not a crisisof faith, but a crisis of worthiness,” feelings to which the perpetually self-doubting Audrey could relate.

Still, Audrey hesitated. The idea intrigued, but at this same time, she wasonce again considering the ongoing request that she star in the film adapta-tion of The Diary of Anne Frank. Contrary to the accepted story that Audreyhad instantaneously turned down the idea of starring in Anne Frank becauseit rang too close to her own wartime experience, she now wrote to Fred Zin-nemann that Kurt Frings and George Stevens were in fact trying to “work outa schedule whereby Anne Frank could possibly be done before the Nun, but Ican see no way of doing this without jeopardizing your and my preparations.”Audrey was now juggling two highly prestigious properties in Anne Frankand The Nun’s Story—it was all a very long way from Monte Carlo Baby.

Mel and Kurt Frings began pushing Audrey to accept The Nun’s Story.Yes, they acknowledged, location filming in the Belgian Congo might proveto be very uncomfortable. Yes, this was a decidedly different role for her, buttherein lay the attraction. Why not journey out of her comfort zone? Hunger-ing after more substantial onscreen fare, Audrey agreed to take on the role.

Her deal in place—a fee of $\$ 200,000$ plus an additional ten percent of thegross after her salary had been recouped—Audrey grew enthusiastic. Herewas a meaty dramatic role and the chance to work with yet another AcademyAward–winning director. In only her seventh starring role, she would now beguided by her fifth certified legend, with Zinnemann following in the foot-steps of Wyler, Wilder (twice), Vidor, and Donen.

The underpinnings of The Nun’s Story seemed a natural fit for Zinnemann,who instinctively gravitated toward films centering around a personal journeyof self-discovery. In movies ranging from The Men (1950) to High Noon(1952) and The Member of the Wedding (1952), his filmography, in thewords of Zinnemann scholar Gene D. Phillips, constituted a cinematic searchfor the “self-knowledge that enables [the character] to find his place in thecommunity in which he lives.”

The erudite Zinnemann, who had first been sent Hulme’s novel by hisfriend Gary Cooper, would here be working with color for only the secondtime in his career (the first was on Oklahoma! in 1955) while functioning inthe dual capacities of director and executive producer. Esteemed throughoutHollywood he may have been, but Zinnemann was the first to admit that TheNun’s Story was greenlit for production for only one reason—the involve-ment of Audrey Hepburn. Said Zinnemann of the time spent pitching the filmto various studios: “Unhappily, my enthusiasm was not shared by any of thestudios. . . . But when Audrey said she wanted to do it the studios suddenlybecame intensely interested,” and Warner Bros. committed to a top-tierbudget of $\$ 3.5$ million. In the director’s own words: “With the exception ofIngrid Bergman, there was at that time no star as incandescent as Audrey. Shewas shy, coltish, and intelligent; she looked delicate, but there was a hint ofiron in the jawline that signified a stubborn will. I thought she would beideal.”

The feeling proved mutual, with Audrey commenting in later years: “I wasvery fortunate to fall into a period of moviemaking when these directors werearound and wanted me. That’s the miracle of my career because I haven’t

made that many pictures.” Just as proved the case with both William Wylerand Billy Wilder, a lifelong friendship with Zinnemann followed, and eightyears later he expressed a desire to cast her as Sir Thomas More’s daughter inhis film version of Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons; the idea nevergained traction, however, both because of scheduling problems and becauseAudrey, nearly forty by the time of production, was too old for the role.

Favorite cinematographer Franz Planer would be on board for The Nun’sStory, as would production designer Alexandre Trauner, who had recentlyworked with Audrey on Love in the Afternoon. After the bishop of Brugesnixed location shooting at the actual Sisters of Charity convent in Belgium,the highly skilled and detail-oriented Trauner set about recreating SisterLuke’s convent and chapel at the Centro Sperimentale and Cinecitta studios.By shooting these interiors in Rome rather than Hollywood, the productionwould save $\$ 1$ million while also remaining near Santa Sabina, the MotherHouse of the Dominican Order whose members served as advisers on thefilm.

Given that real nuns were not allowed to be photographed, the locationshooting in Rome meant that extras were utilized for the ceremonial scenes ofreligious processions. Explained Zinnemann: “In the end, twenty dancerswere borrowed from the ballet corps of the Rome Opera and were drilled bytwo Dominican nuns, one of them a university professor.” For close-ups ofthe nuns, Zinnemann looked for faces of “great character and personality”and found them, surprisingly, among the Roman aristocracy. Wrote the dir-ector: “A lot of principessas and contessas would turn up in their Rolls-Royces or Mercedes at five in the morning. Dressed as nuns they looked mar-velous.”

Far from trying to populate the film with real-life Roman Catholics, Zin-nemann preferred not to use such true believers: “It seemed important to keepan objective approach to the work, without the emotional involvement afaithful believer would bring to it, as this would create a private sentimentalquality I wanted to avoid at all costs.” Robert Anderson, a Protestant, EdithEvans and Audrey as Christian Scientists, and Peggy Ashcroft as an agnostic,all passed this test.

Given the fact that Audrey would spend most of the film clad in a habit,the services of Givenchy were not required, but wanting the security blanketof advice from her trusted friend, Audrey asked that Hubert review Marjorie

Best’s designs. Sister Luke’s simple habit would, she felt, require attention todetail that would help define her character. She wanted to test the movementof the fabric while walking and kneeling, and sought to develop a sensememory of just how the garment changed her posture and demeanor. Eventhe manner in which the nuns held the skirts of their habits influenced her in-terpretation and inventiveness, and when Sister Luke walks out of the con-vent at film’s end, it was Audrey who decided that she would instinctivelymove to hold her skirt “and then realize she no longer has that kind of skirt.”

Given Audrey’s image as an avatar of fashion chic, it may have come as asurprise to some—but not to Zinnemann—how devoted she was to her craft.Before filming began, Audrey, Edith Evans and Peggy Ashcroft stayed at aconvent in order to fully experience the life of a nun. Beginning each daywith prayers at 5:30 a.m., Audrey learned firsthand how a cloistered silentlife replete with closed doors and grills affected one’s own psychological out-look. How, she wondered, did Gabrielle feel when she lost her own name andacquired the name Sister Luke? How did it feel for Sister Luke to be referredto as #1072?

Contacting Marie Louise Habets in order to gain further understanding ofthe nun’s life, Audrey formed a friendship with the former nun which grewinto a genuinely close relationship. She peppered Marie Louise with ques-tions about surgical nursing: How were instruments handled? What were theproper sterilization procedures?

Wanting to acquire firsthand experience, she attended several operations,but her most intensive preparation revolved around her collaboration withZinnemann. It has been claimed that Audrey closely studied Carl Dreyer’shighly regarded 1928 silent film, The Passion of Joan of Arc, although Zin-nemann himself denied ever studying the film for insight. What is certain,however, is that actress and director spent great periods of time talking abouthow Sister Luke developed and changed in her reactions to others both in andoutside of the convent. In Zinnemann’s words: “It took many hours of goinginto lots of details. I always work that way with almost all actors. Then whenwe are rehearsing, I always want to see what the actor brings to the part,without telling him what to do . . .”

Given the power of the Catholic Church in 1958, the filmmakers deliber-ately sought the church’s approval regarding Anderson’s script. The churchremained wary, uneasy about Sister Luke’s status as someone incapable of

accepting the church’s edict forbidding any involvement in the war effort.The filmmakers’ discussions with nuns had revealed that obedience remainedthe hardest vow of all to follow, and the church powers remained displeasedwith the screenplay’s declaration “Dear Lord, forgive me, but I cannot obeyanymore.” Here was a nun for whom the German occupation and her father’smurder—temporal, human events—trumped faith in the Almighty, a messagethe church disliked.

So intense were the lengthy discussions with the Dominican Order head-ing the Cinema Office of the Catholic Church, that in his autobiography Zin-nemann details a two-hour discussion regarding a single line spoken by themother superior: “The life of a nun is a life against nature.” The Dominicanadvisers insisted that the line be changed to “a life above nature,” until a Je-suit friend of Zinnemann’s suggested a compromise: “In many ways it’s a lifeagainst nature.” In the end, Edith Evans delivered the line with a slight ad-justment: “In a way, it’s a life against nature.”

Audrey herself struck a diplomatic balance, insisting: “The story is notpro-catholic nor is it anti-catholic. It is simply a story, and a very warm andinteresting one.” In a smart, analytical letter to Mel dated January 20, 1958,she explained the stakes at play: “In the story we find examples of the Ordertrying to make her conform to obedience first, something which to SisterLuke remains secondary until the last; her impulses are always to give andserve first. The coldness she is shown when this honest and courageous wo-man finally leaves the convent with sorrow in her eyes, yet great faith in herheart, should make for an acutely believable finish.”

What the church insisted upon most strongly of all, however, was that anysuggestion of an attraction between Sister Luke and the tough dedicated Dr.Fortunati (Peter Finch) be excised. The mere hint of a possible romance wastamped down, but Hepburn and Finch nonetheless imbued their roles with asubtext of sensuality; to Peter Ustinov, who worked with Fred Zinnemann onThe Sundowners, their abstinence “became an erotic barometer and the unre-quited longings of the protagonists kept hovering on the brink of obscenity.”The film, of course, proved the furthest thing from obscene, but it was non-etheless Dr. Fortunati who pushed Sister Luke toward a greater awareness ofher own true beliefs. In his blunt admonition to Sister Luke: “I’ve seen nunscome and go and I tell you this—you are not like them. You have not got thevocation.”

With all script compromises finally hammered out, location shootingbegan in Stanleyville, Belgian Congo, with four days spent filming at theYalisombo leper colony on an island in the middle of the Congo River. Tomembers of the cast and crew concerned over their proximity to leprosy,Stanley Browne, the colony’s doctor, insisted: “You have less risk of gettingleprosy here than catching a cold in the New York subway.” As detailed byZinnemann, at the end of the four days of shooting, Browne did, however,cheekily add, “Of course you have to understand that the incubation periodfor leprosy is seventeen years.”

Attending church at the colony, Audrey felt awestruck at service’s endwhen all assembled began singing Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” in a mix of Eng-lish, French, Lingala, and Swahili. Deeply moved by the sight of men andwomen who responded to their difficult lives with joy and deep faith, Audreybegan a period of intense self-questioning that would take her thirty years tofully answer, in part by circling back to Africa through her work withUNICEF. How could she, who led a life of such privilege, most effectivelygive back to those who had so little? Certainly, she seemed to feel, there hadto be work of greater import than making movies.

For now, however, the immediate problem lay in managing the extremelydifficult conditions. An expensive sequence featuring three men drowning inquicksand during a torrential rainstorm involved wind machines and thebuilding of a man-made island complete with mini elevators, but the night be-fore shooting, the river fell by two feet, and in Zinnemann’s baffled explana-tion, “all the chicken-wire and cement holding the ‘quicksand’ was glaringlyexposed. Unfortunately, no one knew why the river had shrunk so suddenlyor when it might rise again. The scene was never shot.”

Nor did Zinnemann’s tantalizing proposal to shoot the European sectionsof the film in black-and-white but the African sections in vibrant color, eversee the light of day. The proposal was vetoed by Jack Warner who thoughtthe idea “too tricky and too far ahead of popular imagination.” It was a poordecision on Warner’s part, given the effectiveness with which it would haveunderscored the dichotomy between austere life in Belgium and the tech-nicolor fecundity of Africa.

The way the film leaps forward when it reaches Africa, the screen fillingwith an aerial shot of a river slicing through the green and vibrant landscape,makes it clear that the contrast with Europe, the sense of greater freedom

Africa provides Sister Luke, would have been even more profound if thesefirst shots of Africa had also represented the film’s first shots in color. Re-fused Warner’s permission, Zinnemann had to compensate by shooting theEuropean scenes in a more washed-out color palette.

Hot as it was to film a movie in equatorial Africa while wearing a heavynun’s habit, Audrey remained energized and spoke of her determination tomake the best of whatever came her way: “In the Congo, a cool day was 100and the temperature was often 130. People ask me if I didn’t swelter in mynun’s habit. I didn’t. Actually, all that covering keeps the heat out.” The ever-chic Audrey Hepburn roughing it in Africa? The mere idea was grist for Hol-lywood gossip columnists who began circulating a rumor that Audrey wasdemanding that a bidet be sent to Africa. Audrey’s exasperated response tothe lie? “How and where would you hook it up?” (Zinnemann did detail a re-quest for an air conditioner, which was sent from California to no effect—in-stead of an air conditioner, the studio sent a humidifier . . .) Said Zinnemann:“I have never seen anyone more disciplined, more gracious, or more dedic-ated to her work than Audrey. There was no ego, no asking for extra favors;there was the greatest consideration for her co-workers.”

Ironically, Audrey survived the noticeable hardships of Africa without in-cident, but became extremely ill with painful kidney stones when the film re-turned to Cinecitta Studios for interior shooting. Informed of her daughter’sillness, Ella jetted in from London, while Mel immediately dropped all hiswork and flew to Rome.

Upon recovering from the attack, Audrey returned to filming with an evenmore determined focus, as if her own illness had helped her understand thedifficulties faced by Sister Luke’s patients. It was at this point in the filmingthat Robert F. Hawkins of the New York Times Rome bureau visited the Cine-citta set, ending his visit with a surprised respect for Audrey’s intense prepar-ation; she possessed, he found, “a brilliant grasp of the end result wanted.What seemed nearly effortless was doubtlessly the product of much privatethought, and of hard work.” By this point, so immersed was Audrey in therole that during filming she would neither look in the mirror nor listen to re-cords, explaining: “My character would never do these things.” Said castmatePatricia Bosworth, Audrey “seemed almost transfixed.”

Audrey also consulted in detail with trusted hairdresser Grazia De Rossiabout the character defining sequence in which Gabrielle’s long hair is cut

after she enters the convent. As in Roman Holiday, the hair cutting wouldserve to illustrate her character’s brand-new persona, but the scene carried itsown technical challenges: How could Audrey’s long wig be cut on camerawithout the wig being pulled off balance? The neat solution: Grazia De Rossiherself would play the nun in charge of cutting the postulants’ hair. As SisterLuke sits in profile, awaiting the haircut with her eyes closed, we instantlyunderstand what this symbolic loss of hair is costing her—it is all present inthe stiffness of Audrey’s neck, in the flickering dismay and resistance underher partially closed eyelids. The resulting sequence contained a particularlybeautiful shot in which Zinnemann’s camera focuses upon a large piece ofGabrielle’s hair falling onto a gold platter. She is, as a postulant, fully reject-ing worldly concerns about beauty and appearance, and yet as the close-upsreveal, she has never looked more beautiful.

Audrey always did go to see her daily rushes—“There might be somethingI can still correct”—and The Nun’s Story daily rushes soon revealed a per-formance of far more skill, maturity, and understanding than any she had pre-viously delivered. The convent sequences found her more than holding herown—indeed at times surpassing—the formidable trio of Mildred Dunnock,Dame Peggy Ashcroft, and Dame Edith Evans. With her body shrouded inthe voluminous nun’s habit and only her eyes and mouth revealed, Audreywas able to convey Sister Luke’s metamorphosis from naïve, hopeful girl totired nun simply through the increasing sadness found in her eyes. In the re-call of Patricia Bosworth, before filming the goodbye scene between SisterLuke and best friend Sister Simone (Bosworth): “Audrey drifted over to meand took my hands in hers. ‘Patti,’ she said softly and intensely, don’t do any-thing. Above all, don’t act. The camera picks up everything. But do meanwhat you say.”

Audrey Hepburn, Hollywood star, had completely disappeared, replacedby a nun exemplifying the ineffable qualities of faith, disappointment, and thedetermination to endure. By means of subtle shifts in her body language, aswell as the glimpses of frustration flashing silently across her face, Audrey isable to show Sister Luke’s evolution from submission to resistance. Shewants to escape the stifling dictates of the ruling cardinals in Rome as surelyas she wants to help people escape the Germans.

Audrey is aided immeasurably throughout by Zinnemann’s beautiful dir-ection. At the end of the movie, as Sister Luke meets with Mother Emmanuel

regarding her request to leave the convent, Zinnemann films the two womenin front of a glass wall, the solitary tree seen in the rain outside clearly stand-ing as a metaphor for Sister Luke. When the mother superior comes to under-stand that Sister Luke is no longer capable of “obedience without question,without inner murmuring,” Zinnemann frames Audrey alone on a bench inthe middle of the frame. She is a solitary figure, about to lose the protectionof the convent, and in the next sequence, when she takes off her robes, shewill be leaving the convent without anyone bidding her farewell.

That final scene, an extraordinarily effective four-minute sequence whichbegins with Sister Luke exchanging her habit for street clothes, works beauti-fully because of all the information Audrey is able to silently convey. She re-moves her wimple, and the camera pans upward to an image of a cross, thenext shot finding her dressed in a gray suit and removing the ring symboliz-ing her marriage to Christ. The film has now come full circle, the removal ofthe ring acting as a mirror image to the removal of her own ring when she lefthome for the convent. Placing her hat in a suitcase, she hears a buzzed clicksignaling that the door to leave the convent has opened. Zinnemann’s cameraframes Sister Luke in the doorway and she slowly walks down the street—hesitates—and then turns right. Nothing is wrapped up in a neat and tidy Hol-lywood ending. The ability of one nun’s story to impart universality to thelife choices made by all has reached its ultimate conclusion, and done so incomplete silence.

That silence, in fact, came as the result of an intense argument betweenZinnemann and Jack Warner. The film’s composer, Franz Waxman, was, inZinnemann’s view, anti-Catholic: “What I didn’t know was that he had astrong dislike of the Catholic Church. When we listened to his music it soun-ded like the background for the dungeons of The Count of Monte Cristo. I de-cided not to use very much of it. Franz was outraged and complained to JackWarner.”

Zinnemann’s removal of Waxman’s music from the final scene triggeredan intense disagreement with Jack Warner, who argued that “every WarnerBrothers picture has music at the end.” Forcefully explaining that the inclu-sion of music would send a message to the audience that “Warner Brotherscongratulate the nun on quitting the convent,” Zinnemann pointedly asked themogul: “Is that what you want? If the music is heavy the audience will be de-pressed; I don’t see how you can win.” Warner acquiesced, if grudgingly, and

the camera focused on Gabrielle’s retreating figure without a single note ofmusical accompaniment.

Zinnemann’s style of editing also helped to increase the film’s effective-ness given his notable use of more fragmented scenes toward the end of thefilm, “partly because of the tension and the war, and partly because the tempoof life intensifies. It’s no longer the idyllic Congo.” Just as the outside worldhas fallen apart, so too has Sister Luke’s private interior world, and in theend, when she leaves the convent, the film has once again reverted to thelonger takes utilized in the first half of the film: the storytelling itself hascome full circle.

So complete is the film’s quiet study of religious vocation and loss of faiththat its few shortcomings do not detract from its overall effectiveness. By thetime of Sister Luke’s departure from the convent, close to twenty years haveelapsed between the 1920s-era start of the film and the hostilities of WorldWar II, but you wouldn’t know it by looking at Audrey’s seemingly identicalhair. Since nunneries are not exactly known as a center of hair dyeing andbeauty treatments, a few, or several, strands of gray hair would have gone along way toward silently indicating that passage of time.

Such a misstep is a small quibble, however, in the face of what Zinnemannand Audrey have achieved: an absorbing, effective inquiry into the verynature of faith and God. Said an impressed Marie Louise Habets after attend-ing the screening of a four-hour rough cut: “I’m never going to see it againbecause if I do I’m going to run right back to the convent. . . . I could just sitthere and cry my eyes out, not with regret, but because of the beauty of it. Itis a beautiful life, the religious life, if you . . . can accept it without murmur-ing all the time.”

Warner Bros., however, remained very uneasy about the film’s prospects,unsure if anyone wanted to see a film about a nun’s life, starring AudreyHepburn in the most atypical role of her career. Their answer came in theform of grosses which made it the most successful Warner Bros. film of theyear, with a cumulative worldwide gross of $\$ 11.5$ million against a cost ofonly $\$ 3.5$ million. (Given the canny deal struck by Kurt Frings which gaveAudrey a percentage of the film’s profits, this would prove to be the mostpersonally profitable film she ever made.)

The Nun’s Story would go on to earn eight Academy Award nominations,including Best Picture, Best Actress (Audrey’s third nomination), Best Dir-

ector (Zinnemann), Screenplay (Robert Anderson), Cinematography (FranzPlaner), Editing, Score, and Sound. And, while the film would not win any ofthe Oscars for which it was nominated, Audrey, who was also nominated fora Golden Globe Award, did win a Best Actress award from the New YorkFilm Critics; in a close race between Audrey and Simone Signoret (whowould win the Oscar for Room at the Top), the New York Film Critics ulti-mately selected Audrey as Best Actress on the sixth ballot. Audrey wouldalso go on to win the BAFTA award as Best Actress and Zinnemann wonhonors as Best Director from both the New York Film Critics and the Na-tional Board of Review.

Regarding Audrey’s performance, there remains near unanimous agree-ment. Says Jeanine Basinger: “Audrey Hepburn here gives one of the greatperformances by an actress in the history of film. I don’t say that lightly be-cause normally if the film involves nuns I run for the hills. I think I wasfrightened as a child by The Song of Bernadette! The film is beautifully direc-ted by Zinnemann—he was a very intelligent director, never flashy, who ad-justed his style according to the material. Sister Luke’s inner struggle is verydifferent from Gary Cooper’s sheriff in High Noon, but Zinnemann brings thesame sensitivity to both films. This film is the true test of Audrey Hepburn asa superb actress. There is no fashion in sight—she’s in a nun’s habit andthat’s it. She is here presenting herself bare—there’s not even a hint of amovie star wearing a nun’s habit. Her face is so beautifully expressive, andher intelligence is on full display. The performance is in total service to thecharacter. Look at how different Sister Luke is from Joanna in Two for theRoad—it takes a real actress to encompass that range. She really should havewon the Academy Award for her performance as Sister Luke.”

Said Zinnemann in later years: “Looking at the film again, after more thantwenty-five years, I am struck by the fine, firm line of development inAudrey’s performance. The subconscious quality of independence is presentin all her actions.” The feeling of admiration proved mutual, with Audrey inlater years exclaiming: “Fred Zinnemann is a perfectionist. It was wonder-ful!”

Without any couture fashion in sight and featuring long stretches of si-lence that deepen its consideration of religious dedication, The Nun’s Storyfeatured an Audrey whose performance, in the words of Henry Hart in Filmin Review, should “forever silence those who have thought her less an actress

than a symbol of the sophisticated child-woman.” Said her son Sean: “I thinkmy mother was proudest of The Nun’s Story . . . she thought it was an import-ant film.”

Decades later, it was Robert Wolders who best expressed the import ofThe Nun’s Story in Audrey’s filmography, unexpectedly yet logically ex-plaining that the character of Sister Luke represented the woman closest tothe real Audrey Hepburn: “What I see in the film and in the character is soclose to Audrey in those moments when she was in turmoil, when there wassomething she could not resolve.” By drawing deeply upon her own conflic-ted personality and feelings, Audrey had achieved not just her best perform-ance, but her deepest personal expression of art’s universality and power toheal.

# Chapter Twenty

# FEATURE FILM MISTAKE #2—THE UNFOR-

# GIVEN, 1960

“Some of my pictures I don’t care for. This one I actively dislike.”

—Director John Huston

AFTER THE WORLDWIDE SUCCESS OF The Nun’s Story, Audrey Hepburn was morein demand than ever, with her slightest signal of attraction to the materialserving to greenlight virtually any film that captured her interest. And yet,just as with any topflight Hollywood actress, Audrey occasionally undertookroles that left audiences wondering, “What was she thinking?” Which meantthat if Green Mansions, the bizarre fantasy that found Audrey traipsingaround the jungle, represented her first head-scratcher, then her second wal-loping mistake came with John Huston’s The Unforgiven (1960).

What was Audrey doing in the midst of Huston’s surpassingly strangewestern? For an actress indelibly associated with high fashion and romanticcomedies, playing a nineteenth-century Native American woman proved oddindeed. This was not terra firma for Audrey, a state of affairs proven literallytrue when, during location filming in Durango, she fell off an Arabian stal-lion once owned by Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista and ended up in thehospital for weeks.

Which is getting ahead of a story, where, in the very beginning, Audreyexpressed an interest in filming a western. After reading the Ben MaddowUnforgiven screenplay (based upon Alan Le May’s novel of the same name),Audrey decided to take a leap of faith; perhaps it was the chance to spreadher wings acting-wise that made her agree to play “Rachel Zachary,” a KiowaIndian “rescued” in childhood and raised by a white family in the Texas pan-handle of the 1860s. Only Rachel’s “mother” (Lillian Gish) knows that she is

a full-blooded Kiowa Indian, and the simmering racial tensions on display fi-nally explode at film’s end, in a shootout led by Rachel’s brother Ben (BurtLancaster).

It all seemed a questionable setting for such a sophisticated and contin-ental actress, but Audrey was, understandably enough, drawn to the idea ofworking with award-winning director John Huston. Add in a paycheck for$\$ 200,000$ and a $\$ 6$ million budget, which made the film one of the most ex-pensive westerns ever made, and it all shaped up as a promising endeavor.What could really go wrong? As it turned out, plenty.

For starters, director Huston and star/producer Burt Lancaster clashedthroughout filming. Both men proved wildly egocentric, and while Hustoncalled the shots behind the camera, Lancaster held the ultimate financialpower as the film’s producer. As soon as shooting began, Huston grew in-creasingly disgruntled when he realized that Lancaster and his producingpartner James Hill wanted to make a traditional western, ignoring the consid-erations of racism that had intrigued Huston in the first place.

Sporting long hair which fell down her back, Audrey was covered in red-dish-dark makeup which did little to help convince the viewer that she wasNative American, and her comfort level was not helped by the fact that shedisliked the hot, dusty location conditions. More disconcertingly, the skinmakeup seemed to disappear from one scene to another, leaving all viewerspuzzled as to exactly where Rachel was living; she’s shown riding horsesoutdoors in the scorched plains of the west, but in the next scene her reddishskin tone appears to have become all white. Had Rachel gone to the Alps toescape the heat? In her own life, Audrey thrived in the outdoors, taking longhikes through the mountainous Swiss countryside, but here she appears noth-ing so much as ill at ease. Whether on horseback or not, she had to indulge inthe most un-Audrey-like of activities: firing a shotgun!

Beautifully photographed throughout by Franz Planer, Audrey nonethelessproves disconcerting every time she must speak the pedestrian dialogue. Sheof the perfectly modulated speaking voice was now declaiming: “I never seenyou before . . . I’m dreamin’, ain’t I?” The wildly uneven screenplay makes itimpossible to take Rachel’s supposedly homespun wisdom seriously: con-templating a flock of geese, Audrey exclaims: “They jest fly a mite higherthan us.” There is simply no way that this Rachel, for all of her “ain’ts” and“jests,” registers as a believable Kiowa Native American.

Huston’s directorial methods also left Audrey more than a bit at sea, andwhile they got along well, their director-actress collaboration proved to be anuneasy mix of styles. Used to the exacting precision of Wyler, Wilder, andDonen, Audrey found that Huston “makes the artist take a lot of responsibil-ity and that is like a challenge.”

Filming plodded along, and Audrey remained uneasy over the amount oftime she had to spend riding horses. She had, in fact, developed a fear of rid-ing after breaking her collarbone when thrown from a horse at age eleven, butduring the making of War and Peace, Mel had helped her conquer that fear.Then, in the midst of Unforgiven’s mix of bad weather, warring egos, andcornpone dialogue, came a terrible accident. On January 28, 1959, while rid-ing her horse “Diablo,” Audrey took a bad fall and landed on her back, frac-turing four vertebrae in the process. She lay unconscious for five minutes,and Mel flew in with her personal doctor, Howard Mendelson. She was even-tually flown back to Los Angeles via ambulance plane, and Marie Louise Ha-bets, the real life “Sister Luke” of The Nun’s Story, spent three weeks nursingher back to health.

As noted by Marie Louise, Audrey refused to take any narcotics or sedat-ives, no matter how great her discomfort. Taking her first steps again on Feb-ruary 15, she quickly returned to the set and gamely hoisted herself back ontoDiablo to complete the aborted riding scene. By now, however, the produc-tion seemed cursed: co-star Audie Murphy nearly drowned in a duck-huntingaccident, and three crew members were killed in a plane crash.

When all was said and done, the film remained too uneven for any coher-ent audience response. For every beautifully photographed outdoor scene,there is a strangely truncated consideration of the plight facing Native Amer-icans, until the entire story bogs down in a strange mishmash of styles andoddball psychology. At the story’s climax, with the Zachary family undersiege from the Kiowas, Rachel asks her brother Ben (Lancaster) if he would“fancy her” if they weren’t related—he answers the question by kissing herwhile surrounded by Native Americans trying to kill them both. How doesRachel solve this conundrum? By shooting and killing her actual NativeAmerican brother. Even Sigmund Freud would throw up his hands at thisone.

Planer’s lighting of the landscape proved capable of explaining the film’sstory and subtext far more eloquently than does the screenplay, but uneven-

ness of tone and style does the film in. Burdened with an inappropriatelyjaunty score by Dimitri Tiomkin, the film led Huston to conclude in lateryears that “the overall tone is bombastic and overinflated. Everybody in it isbigger than life. . . . But Hepburn was a trouper and I wished I had used herto better advantage. She could have carried the picture if I let her.”

The film proved unsuccessful with critics and audiences alike and earnedAudrey a rare outright pan from critic Dwight Macdonald: “She is not an act-ress, she is a model, with her stiff meagre body and her blank face full ofgood bone structure. She has the model’s narcissism, not the actress’s intro-version.” Countered Huston, who had already triumphed directing KatharineHepburn in The African Queen (1951): “She’s as good as the other Hepburn.”

Yes, Audrey appreciated Huston’s support, but there was, she felt, onlyone part in life that warranted her full and total commitment. Audrey Hep-burn Ferrer desperately wanted to be a mother.

# Chapter Twenty-OneMOTHERHOOD, 1960

“My mother wanted to have a kid because she wanted to right the wrongsof her childhood.”

—Sean Hepburn Ferrer

AMID THE UPS AND DOWNS of a world-famous Hollywood career, ranging fromthe triumph of The Nun’s Story to the failure of The Unforgiven, one elementremained constant for Audrey: family mattered more to her than did any ca-reer. In an interesting choice of words redolent of the 1950s and early 1960s,she opined: “My greatest ambition is to have a career without becoming a ca-reer woman.”

Audrey’s yearning for a child of her own had taken hold when she wasstill a young girl, when the loss of her father, the war-enforced disappear-ances of her brothers, the uncertainty of her own continued existence, and therather muted love displayed by Ella, all combined to instill a sense that onlyhaving her own children would bring her unconditional love and stability.Nothing else would allow her to lavish the love she so desperately wanted toexpress, which made what ultimately proved to be four miscarriages, includ-ing the loss of a little girl she carried almost to midterm, all the more painful:“From the earliest time I can remember, the thing I most wanted was babies.My miscarriages were more painful to me than anything ever, including myparents’ divorce and the disappearance of my father.” In Sean’s view, hismother’s overwhelming desire to have children was in fact tied directly tothat fractured relationship with her father: “I think it was part of the healingfrom her father having left the family when she was so young.”

Still without the baby she longed for, Audrey told a friend at Christmas of1959: “I must work to forget. Only work can help me; holidays give me time

to think and that’s bad for me.” Two years later Audrey would return to workin the most iconic role of her career, as Holly Golightly in Breakfast atTiffany’s, but first came the happiest news of all: a successful pregnancy andthe birth of her first child.

A son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, was born July 17, 1960, complete with ahighly impressive list of credits: Place of birth—Lucerne, Switzerland.Christened by the same Pastor Endiguer who had married Audrey and Melsix years earlier. Godparents: Audrey’s brother Ian and Mel’s sister Terry.Christening gown courtesy of Hubert de Givenchy. An American passport,accompanied by an American flag, personally delivered by the U.S. ambas-sador to Switzerland. It all made for an impressive A-list welcome, but thenagain, it’s not every newborn whose birth is deemed worldwide news worthyof a maternal press conference.

Said Audrey: “I would like to mix Sean with all kinds of people in allcountries. . . . If he’s the right kind of person, he should take his own smallpart in making the world a better place.”

For the first time since earliest childhood she felt complete, even grantinginterviews to discuss her newfound happiness as a mother: “I’m sure it’swonderful when you’re 18. But if you wait years, the joy is impossible to de-scribe.” After all her miscarriages, Audrey was ecstatic to be a mother, andher past history, in Sean’s view, helped explain why mother and son formedsuch a close bond: “I think when she finally had me, it was more than just thedesire of having a child. It was also a healing from those experiences. I knowit was very, very hard for her. That she did talk about.”

With a child now completing their family, Audrey and Mel began to ex-plore additional options about where to bring up their son. They did in factutilize Bürgenstock as their home base for a decade, which meant that for thefirst years of his life, Sean was brought up at that exclusive mountain resort.Bürgenstock may have proved a bit too far removed from the show businesshubbub for Mel’s taste, but to Audrey’s delight, Sean would now grow up farfrom Hollywood, in the countryside setting she loved. The fresh mountain airwas even proving to help with Audrey’s own lifelong case of asthma.

That Bürgenstock villa, decorated according to Audrey’s own exactingstandards, even met with approval from the ever-spiky Cecil Beaton. Writingin his diaries of a March 1964 visit to the Ferrers’ chalet, he enthused: “Tostep inside this Swiss doll’s house was to realize what I had missed in St.

Moritz. Everything was white, and of a clean simplicity; white cotton coverson chairs, long white net curtains and white Swiss linen everywhere; hugebouquets of white tulips or yellow flowers to complement the orange and yel-low sofas; an incredible impeccability—in the modern white china, the em-broidered napkin wrapping the brown-bread toast, the array of books, the Pi-casso drawing, the Modigliani figure, the Matisse head. The bedrooms withtheir covers and huge pillows were of a mountain-water cleanliness. This wassomething more nourishing than a good steak, for it was food for the spirit. . .. Audrey is very proud of her home and everything in it. . . .The infinitetrouble and the finesse she manages strike me as being extraordinary.”

Her privacy maintained in Bürgenstock, Audrey began to form newfriendships, including a blossoming acquaintance with Sophia Loren, whohad recently moved to Switzerland. Both women experienced great difficultyin bearing children, with Sophia’s first child, Carlo Ponti Jr., born five yearsafter Sean. When Sophia would visit Audrey, the two young but already le-gendary actresses would talk shop, husbands, and parenting, and in a neat re-versal of the expected, it was Audrey who would cook pasta for Sophia.

She wanted to stay home. Take care of Sean. Movies were nice, but de-cidedly not the priority. Except—Hollywood kept knocking at her door, of-fering enormous salaries. Perks. And the role of a lifetime.

Which she didn’t want.

# Chapter Twenty-Two

# WHEN AUDREY MET HOLLY, 1961

“Everything you have read, heard or wished to be true about Audrey Hep-burn doesn’t come close to how wonderful she was. . . . She was just anextraordinary, extraordinary person. Everyone should know that.”

—Richard Shepard, producer of Breakfast at Tiffany’s

IF, IN THE LIFE OF every Hollywood superstar, there is one career defining rolethat solidifies image, fame, and career—Streisand with Funny Girl or Bogartwith Casablanca—then in the life of Audrey Hepburn, such a moment ar-rived in 1961 with Breakfast at Tiffany’s. That reality is rather paradoxicalsince Audrey had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the set, a state ofaffairs which in the Hepburn universe means that she had politely explainedher resistance to the role more than once.

The fact that the image of Audrey standing in front of Tiffany’s glittersmore brightly than any portrait of Eliza Doolittle or Sabrina ever could iseven more ironic in light of the fact that Truman Capote, author of thenovella upon which Breakfast at Tiffany’s was based, felt that Audrey Hep-burn was a terrible choice to play his beloved Holly Golightly. Yet out of themix of Audrey’s reluctance and Capote’s disapproval came—and it is not toostrong a phrase—movie magic that continues to resonate around the worldsixty plus years after the film’s initial release.

When Capote introduced Holly Golightly to the world in his 1959 novellaBreakfast at Tiffany’s (And Other Stories), even the egocentric author himselfcould not have fully anticipated the lasting impact his creation would have.What would have irked him more than a little, royalty checks notwithstand-ing, is that the long shadow Holly casts has come courtesy of Audrey Hep-burn more than from his own novella. Because much as Capote admired

Audrey Hepburn and considered her his friend, she did not match his ownvision of Lulamae Barnes, the backwoods girl who descends upon New YorkCity in the late 1940s and reinvents herself as glamorous, sophisticated HollyGolightly.

In structure and tone, Breakfast at Tiffany’s certainly seems strikingly sim-ilar to Christopher Isherwood’s Berlin Stories (1945), another collectionwhich featured a “kooky” heroine and a male narrator of uncertain sexuality.Knowing that Isherwood’s stories had been successfully adapted into both aBroadway play and a movie (1955’s I Am a Camera), when Capote’s novellagrew into a national best-seller, Hollywood came calling in the form of inde-pendent producers Martin Jurow and Richard Shepherd. Would Capote sellthe film rights? A lunch was arranged, with Capote making an entranceworthy of Holly herself. Quipped Jurow: “Only Mae West could have made abigger production out of his entrance than did Capote.” The author, a fan ofsizable Hollywood paychecks, was definitely interested, but insisted thatthere was only one Hollywood star who could portray Holly—Marilyn Mon-roe.

In fact, Capote emphasized, Marilyn wanted the role so much that she had“worked up” two scenes to perform only for Capote. Given the author’sstatus as an inveterate spinner of tall tales in which he figured as everyone’sall-knowing confidante, the truth of that assertion is unknown, but what iscertain is that he pushed wholeheartedly for Marilyn to play Holly. That tan-talizing possibility, however, was not to be.

Two competing versions of Monroe’s non-participation have circulatedthrough the years. The first has Monroe’s Svengali/acting coach Paula Stras-berg saying: “Marilyn Monroe will not play a lady of the evening.” Thesecond finds producers Jurow and Shepherd refusing to consider Monroe forthe role, explaining that they simply could not see Marilyn Monroe success-fully portraying a self-invented sophisticate who window shops at Tiffany’s.(At this point Marilyn was not the only actress talked about for the role; JaneFonda had been mentioned as a possibility, and Shirley MacLaine, then in theprocess of cornering the market on portraying kooks [Some Came Running,1958, and Two for the Seesaw, 1962] seemed a real possibility but proved un-available.)

It all provides a fascinating question of “what if” because Marilyn, withher trademark mixture of breathy sexuality and naivete was, in many ways,

right for the role of Holly. If Audrey Hepburn is still, somehow, innocent byfilm’s end, Marilyn Monroe would have provided a more palpable layer ofsadness, so overwhelming was her fragility onscreen and off. Monroe was theonly actress capable of conveying a quality of yearning as skillfully as didAudrey, but hers was of a more wounded and desperate variety than Hep-burn’s ever was.

What Shepherd and Jurow understood was that Audrey was respected inher films in ways Marilyn never was. Men did not take Audrey for grantedand never put overt sexual pressure upon her, and those were qualities whichwould go a long way toward making the fact of Holly’s prostitution more pal-atable in the America of 1961. It was Audrey’s onscreen persona, one whichembodied the battle between a desire for true love and the need to maintainfreedom, that had struck a chord with women around the world, and it wasthat friction which lay at the core of Breakfast at Tiffany’s.

In the end, perhaps the best summary of the different qualities the twostars would bring to the role was provided by Robert Wolders: “MarilynMonroe would probably have been allowed to play the character as created inthe book, but they unfortunately wouldn’t allow Hepburn to do that. I’vefound myself wishing she could have done the part as written. People don’tknow how earthy and how true to life Audrey could be.” And yet, inWolders’s view, it was Audrey’s essential persona that allowed her to suc-cessfully portray Holly: “She had a way of showing us who she really was.She had a way of making you look into her soul. And you see it whether sheplayed a princess or a nun or a flower girl or Holly Golightly.”

Given Capote’s resistance to Audrey, it’s ironic that in his novella the de-scription of a Holly figurine seems to bear a noticeable resemblance toAudrey herself: “an elongated carving of a head, a girl’s, hair sleek and shortas a young man’s, her smooth wood eyes too large and tilted in the taperingface, her mouth wide.” Even the narrator’s first glimpse of Holly seems tohave been written with Audrey in mind, as he describes her wearing a “slimcool black dress, black sandals, a pearl choker. For all her chic thinness shehad an almost breakfast cereal air of health . . . her mouth was large. . . . Apair of dark glasses blotted out her eyes. It was a face beyond childhood, yetthis side of belonging to a woman.”

Once the rights to Capote’s novella had been secured, Shepherd and Jurowfocused upon finding a screenwriter capable of capturing Holly’s essence

while sanitizing Capote’s novella for mass consumption. Given Hollywood’slingering prudery regarding matters of sex, the job required a delicate, nearlyfloating touch; it was George Axelrod, who had scored successes with hisscreenplays for The Seven Year Itch (1955), Bus Stop (1956), and Will Suc-cess Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957), who struck Jurow and Shepherd as the bestchoice to navigate the required thin line between fidelity to story and censor-ship.

Axelrod’s solution to those competing demands was to follow many of thenovella’s set pieces while at the same time adding a love story between Hollyand her neighbor Paul Varjak. Gone was Varjak’s questionable sexuality andin came a love story between Holly and her handsome neighbor. Paul wasnow presented as avowedly heterosexual, albeit a kept man, courtesy of thewealthy woman known as “2E Failenson.” Said producer Shepherd of castingPatricia Neal as “2E”: “We wanted someone who was no-nonsense, whocould play that strong subterranean sexual role. Pat Neal was a fan ofAudrey’s, and it was a very good role.” Between 2E Failenson and Holly,Paul would now be one busy man, because in Axelrod’s telling, Holly andPaul also go to bed—he’s just so exhausted that it turns into a non-event.Why exhausted? Because according to the dictates of 1961 Hollywood, ro-mance must come before sex.

As written by Axelrod, Holly is still a call girl—it’s just that her profes-sion is never directly referenced. For Jurow and Shepherd it proved to be aclear-cut case of rationalization: neither of them, they explained, had everthought of Holly as a prostitute. She was simply “a woman who defied defin-ition.” Translation: Holly on screen would be less complicated than in thenovella, with all rough edges and quirks sanded down for widespread con-sumption.

Given the opposition to Monroe, Audrey’s name began to be mentionedfor the role of Holly with increasing frequency. Blissfully happy as themother of one-year-old Sean, she nonetheless still maintained an interest inmaking select film appearances. She knew this film would garner a great dealof attention from the press, but the thought of playing a prostitute gave herpause. Audrey, who yearned for roots, her own home, and children, playingthe completely rootless Holly? She hesitated—and then hesitated again. Be-cause for all her stardom and awards, Audrey Hepburn remained riddled withgenuine self-doubt, going so far as to tell one interviewer: “I have often

thought of myself as quite ugly. To be frank, I’ve often been depressed anddeeply disappointed in myself. You can even say that I hated myself at cer-tain periods.”

Perhaps that is why Audrey responded so well to the duality of LulamaeBarnes and Holly Golightly. Savvy about her own onscreen persona, Audreyknew that audiences enjoyed watching her turn into Cinderella, whether inRoman Holiday, Sabrina, or Funny Face. At the same time, she realized, inBreakfast at Tiffany’s the transformation came with a twist: unlike PrincessAnn and Sabrina, Holly’s Cinderella-like metamorphosis into a chic sophist-icate was already complete at the film’s outset.

Holly’s new persona, however, remained tinged with desperation. For allthe bon mots—“A girl can’t read without her lipstick”—Holly still yearns.She’s just not sure for what. Her assured exterior masked a fragile psyche,and that, thought Audrey, could give her something very real to play. Maybeyes—maybe no—she hesitated again. Kurt Frings pressed her. Say yes.

Mmm—possibly . . .

At which point Mel Ferrer, always savvy about Audrey’s career, urged herto take the chance. Say yes—step toward the unknown. Added producerJurow: “Audrey still had qualms about playing the role until I said that it wasnot a lady of the evening that we sought but a lopsided romantic, a dreamerof dreams.” Lulamae Barnes spinning her own dreams while sitting by thefire escape. Or the backwoods river. Waiting ’round the bend . . .

OK—Audrey would do it, distraught though she was at having to leaveSean in Switzerland while filming in New York City and Hollywood.Audrey’s yes, however, came with conditions: prostitute or not, Holy’sclothes would be designed by Givenchy, and that requirement was nonnegoti-able. Holly had to have some plainer clothes for daily life, and those wouldbe provided by the redoubtable Edith Head, but the glamorous gowns were tobe Givenchy’s, start to finish. Thought—and negotiation—went into thecredit: “Miss Hepburn’s wardrobe principally by Hubert de Givenchy, MissNeal’s wardrobe principally by Pauline Trigere, costume supervision byEdith Head.”

The ever-practical Head now supervised making copies of the soon-to-be-famous Givenchy gowns. Any feelings that such a job was beneath her werebanished by her knowledge that Audrey was then in talks for Summer andSmoke, and, writes Head biographer David Chierichetti, “since Givenchy had

not before designed period costumes, Edith was sure the job would go to her.In his autobiography, [producer] Hal Wallis says that the matter of whowould design the costumes was the reason that Hepburn did not star in Sum-mer and Smoke.” For Audrey, loyalty to Givenchy trumped any role.

As it turned out, Audrey’s last encounter with Head came in the UniversalStudios commissary in the 1970s, and when Audrey exclaimed: “Why Edith,you haven’t changed a bit,” Head abruptly replied: “I haven’t had time to,I’ve been too busy working.” Chierichetti, who observed the interaction, feltthat with this comment Head had directed a dig at Audrey’s then ongoing re-tirement from films. Ultimately, however, even Head recognized Audrey’sextraordinary fashion intelligence and simply stated: “Audrey could havebeen a designer herself, she had such perfect taste.”

It was at this point that Truman Capote weighed in on the casting of Holly,writing to Audrey shortly after Sean was born: “I have no opinion of the filmscript, never having had the opportunity to read it. But since Audrey andHolly are both such wonderful girls, I feel nothing can defeat either of them.”Nice words. Perhaps he even meant them. But still the whispers about the au-thor’s preference for Monroe persisted.

Whoever directed the film would need both skill and an above averagesensitivity to navigate the screenplay’s balancing act between appearance(New York City sophisticate) and reality (prostitute) and the producers beganpushing for the up-and-coming John Frankenheimer to land the job. Not fa-miliar with his work, and used to Hollywood heavyweights like Wilder andWyler, Audrey nixed the choice. Recounted Frankenheimer: “I was fired be-cause of course she had never heard of me. I had directed a lot of televisionbut only one film—so I was canned.” Frankenheimer, who triumphed oneyear later with the extraordinary Manchurian Candidate, would undoubtedlyhave made a darker film, one closer in spirit to the book, but in 1961, no onewas interested in dark when it came to Audrey Hepburn, New York City, andTiffany’s.

Enter Blake Edwards.

A veteran television director of the highly successful Peter Gunn, Ed-wards had by this time also helmed the amusing feature film Operation Petti-coat (1959) with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. He could handle stars, and hismodern sensibility seemed sympatico with the film’s deliberate update fromthe New York City of the ’40s and ’50s to Kennedy-era Manhattan. One fur-

ther element: Blake Edwards wanted this job—badly. “I would have done it ifI had to crawl all the way up the walk of fame. It was a big opportunity forme.”

Audrey began expressing her concerns to Edwards, who realized that “inAudrey’s mind it was a big jump from Capote’s Holly to our film’s Holly. . .. I told her I thought she would be absolutely great. She would not be theHolly of Truman’s book. . . . I don’t think the majority of the audiencethought of Audrey as a call girl.” Fully convinced by Blake’s assurance thatHolly would be “purified by the style in which he would shoot the picture,”Audrey capitulated, explaining: “It was Blake Edwards who finally per-suaded me (to become Holly). He at least is perfectly cast as a director, and Idiscovered his approach emphasizes the same sort of spontaneity as myown.”

Her happiness grew when he agreed to hire Franz Planer as cinemato-grapher. Ever worried about her teeth, her feet, her square jaw, hereverything, Audrey knew that after his Academy Award–nominated triumphson Roman Holiday and The Nun’s Story, as well as his work on The Unfor-given, Planer could and would protect her. In fact, whatever the problemswith The Unforgiven—and they were legion—none of them, Audrey felt,could be blamed on Planer. Franz Planer made Audrey Hepburn feel secure.

The casting of Audrey’s leading man remained problematic until GeorgePeppard’s name began to pop up with increasing frequency. Extraordinarilyhandsome, the Actors Studio–trained, self-serious Peppard, born one year be-fore Audrey, would become only the second leading man in Audrey’s careerwhose age approximated her own (the other being Anthony Perkins in GreenMansions). Ruminating about the casting of Peppard decades later, Blake Ed-wards explained: “We liked each other as human beings. He liked me and ad-mired me greatly, I found out, as a director—and I didn’t want him in themovie! If you would ask me if I would cast him now, I doubt I would. He justdidn’t have what I wanted—just wasn’t my cup of tea.” Nonetheless, castPeppard he did, and while troubles with the actor did seem to rumble beneaththe surface even during preproduction, they would not fully burst forth untilshooting began. For now, it was actually the complicated shooting schedulethat was causing problems.

Interiors would be shot in Hollywood, but the filming would begin witheight days of location shooting in New York, because alongside Audrey and

George Peppard, the third star of the movie remained New York City, ormore specifically, the very idea of New York. Where everyone who doesn’tfit in elsewhere belongs. The pulse, heat, and overwhelming human energy ofManhattan would be faked on a studio set at the risk of disaster because, inthe words of Truman Capote: “[New York City] is like living inside an elec-tric light bulb.” New York City it would be. The Women’s House of Deten-tion. Central Park. Fifth Avenue. The New York Public Library. Tiffany’s.

The press couldn’t get enough: Audrey as a hooker? Not if Paramount hadanything to say about it: Holly would be a kook, not a prostitute. After all,who else but a kook would eat breakfast in front of Tiffany’s and keep a fishin a birdcage? The publicity machine ramped up: “Kook is not, as everybodyassociated with Breakfast at Tiffany’s knows, a beatnik term. Couldn’t be.The star is Audrey Hepburn, not Tawdry Hepburn.”

Audrey herself weighed in: “It’s true we’ve left sex ambiguous in thescript. Too many people think of Holly as a tramp, when actually she’s justputting on an act for shock effect, because she’s very young. Besides I knowTruman Capote very well, and much of what is good and delicate about hiswriting is his elusiveness.”

October 2, 1960. The first day of shooting. Dawn breaking over the nearlysilent Manhattan streets as a still-dressed-from-the-night-before Holly nibblesher breakfast while gazing in the window at Tiffany’s. The title sequence ofthe film, the entire metaphorical underpinnings of the story, would now beshot as the very first scene on the very first day. No time for a warm-up.Time to do or die—for Audrey and Blake alike.

“Quiet please”—and then: “Action!”

Holly/Audrey floats out of a cab into the early quiet of $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Avenue, thestreaks of dawn seeming to burnish her extraordinary, nearly translucentbeauty, the famous swanlike neck wrapped in a five-strand pearl necklace.Soothing herself after being up all night, Holly fights the “mean reds” by gaz-ing at the priceless jewels in the Tiffany windows.

Never mind that in real life the jewels would likely not have been left outovernight in the display window. This is fantasy time, that of a couture-cladliberated woman who has not yet been to bed and is now drinking coffee outof a paper cup while eating a Danish pastry. In front of Tiffany’s. The vieweris instantly captivated. Who is this woman? What is her story?

It’s a breathtaking sequence, because in the atypically peaceful New YorkCity of early morning, the world is literally and figuratively seen in a differ-ent light. No dialogue or voiceover narration intrudes upon the hushed atmo-sphere, and viewers are instantly pulled in—pulled in, that is, because it’sTiffany’s, and especially because it’s Audrey Hepburn. With blond-streakedhair piled high anchored by a tiara-like jewel. The jewel—a seemingly over-the-top look only a self-assured fashionista like Audrey could pull off, andthe perfect accessory for Holly’s dress.

The dress.

Actually, two of them. One for Audrey’s walk up to the window display,and a second designed by Givenchy for standing in front of that window. Adress fitted so snugly that even wafer-thin Audrey could not walk in it.

Audiences looked. And then looked again, memorizing the details. It wasall in the details—a discreet slit right down the side. Nothing to spoil the line.This was not Coco Chanel’s circa 1920 suitable-for-mourning little blackdress. Here was sophisticated elegance, the viewer’s eye drawn to Audrey’sneck, her arms swathed in black opera-length evening gloves. Even the wingeyebrows so carefully drawn to follow the curve of her jaw took second placeto the dress.

Yes, there was another little black dress glimpsed later in the film, short inlength and accessorized with a wide-brim hat. Worn while visiting gangsterSally Tomato at Sing Sing Prison. But it was the dress that opened the film—that stole the film—that imprinted itself upon the world’s collective memory.Plain when viewed from the front, the surprise lay in the low-cut back. Everywoman watching that scene knew she could never be as impossibly thin or aswonderfully glamorous, mysterious, and sad as the ethereal creature gazing inthe window, but when Holly/Audrey eats a pedestrian Danish (and not the icecream cone Audrey requested but was denied by Edwards) it grounded Hollyin a reality with which everyone could identify. As noted by author SamWasson in his definitive study of the making of the film, Fifth Avenue, FiveA.M.: “After Tiffany’s anyone, no matter what their financial situation, couldbe chic every day and everywhere.”

“Cut!”

Blake smiled. Audrey exhaled. Commented Edwards years later about theiconic scene: “It was as if God said, I’m going to give you a break now, butfor the rest of your career you’re going to have to live off this one.”

A rapport quickly developed between Audrey and Blake. At the end ofeach shooting day he would rehearse her next day’s scenes in order to giveher a foundation for the upcoming work. It all seemed agreeable—untilshooting would begin the next morning and Audrey would head off in direc-tions they had never discussed. Decades later, Edwards, who seemed to sus-pect Mel of secretly directing Audrey, explained the on-set situation:“Audrey and I never had a disagreement that I can remember. People wouldadvise Audrey and we’d rehearse one night, and she’d come back the nextday and do something totally different. [I said] ‘there’s only one director andhe may not be the best, but that’s what you got. You either go along withwhat we agree on together or you gotta get another director.’ It changed rightthen. She was some kind of spectacular lady.”

Said Edwards of his star: “She was funny, dear, disciplined, joyous, a hardworker and yet you always felt comfortable because she made it easy. Thecamera loved her—she just glowed.”

Audrey and Blake grew sympatico, her gentleness softening his hard-edged, black humor, but Peppard proved a tougher nut for Blake, in fact foreveryone on the set. With his mannered Method intensity and his need toconstantly question Edwards, clashes ensued, and even Audrey seemed tofind her leading man difficult. Loathe as she was to speak poorly of a fellowactor, she never commented publicly, and Peppard did pay smiling homage toAudrey decades later at her Lincoln Center Film Society tribute. Said PatriciaNeal of Peppard’s modus operandi: “We got along superbly at the ActorsStudio. I was so thrilled to do this film with him. But, he had been spoiled—he wanted things as he wanted them.” Put more bluntly by producer DickShepherd: “I must say there wasn’t a human being that Audrey Hepburndidn’t have a kind word for, except George Peppard. She didn’t like him atall. She thought he was pompous.”

Filming progressed toward the movie’s biggest set piece: Holly’s raucousparty—a whiskey soaked bacchanal and a Blake Edwards specialty: “Thescript didn’t delineate that much in terms of party shenanigans, so I was go-ing to have to invent it.” There would be dozens of extras, oceans of booze,and cigarettes—the very quintessence of early 1960s New York sophistica-tion. Audrey clad in a sheet, languidly smoking through a foot-long black ci-garette holder. A phone ringing inside a suitcase. A woman’s hat set on fire.Witty dialogue: “She’s a phony, but she’s a real phony. You know why? Be-

cause she honestly believes all this phony junk she believes in.” Whichseemed to describe half of Hollywood itself.

Filming of the party took a full week, giving several of the actors time toobserve Audrey up close. In an era when above-the-title stars kept to them-selves and away from the crowd, Audrey, explained Miriam Nelson (“PartyGuest in Gold Dress”) was “so nice. She would sit around and talk to usbetween shots.” The more thorough scrutiny, however, came from Joan Sta-ley, the party’s “Blonde in Low-Cut Cream Dress”: “Audrey was amazing.You could see her soul through her eyes. She was gentle, and calm, and deep.And very much herself.”

In fact, such was the power of Audrey’s appeal—Peppard called her “themost innocent call girl you ever saw”—that it could even surmount thebiggest flaw in the movie, one so egregious that it comes close to shreddingthe fabric of the entire film: the casting of Mickey Rooney as Holly’s Japan-ese neighbor Mr. Yunioshi. Such were the times in early 1960s Hollywoodthat Rooney’s casting as an Asian man did not even generate a great deal ofcomment. Mused Blake Edwards years later: “I didn’t really think it out. I’mnot sure I would have changed my mind anyway but looking back I wish I’dnever done that. At the time, no one criticized me—it was perfectly OK. Iwould give anything to be able to recast it.”

In the light of the twenty-first century, however, Rooney’s portrayalproves nothing short of cringeworthy, his Caucasian features scrunched into acartoon version of an Asian American, all buck teeth and thick glasses. Asthe years passed and changing notions of authenticity in casting caused thecontroversy over Rooney’s portrayal to grow, Rooney himself wrote in hisautobiography that he was “downright ashamed” of his role as Mr. Yunioshi.Strangely, however, he explains that his shame arises only from the flaws hefinds in his acting: “I was too cute. And the whole damn movie was just too,too precious.”

Sean Ferrer, who admires much of his mother’s signature film—“She el-evates the part out of typecasting and transforms it”—expresses his dismayover Rooney’s portrayal: “Breakfast at Tiffany’s is treated as her most sacredfilm, but the casting of Mickey Rooney is a real detriment. Yes, World War IIhad ended only fifteen years before, but there is no need to have Mickey,with fake teeth, screaming over the staircase at Holly. Maybe one day, in afull-scale restoration, we can get those scenes taken out. Nowadays we’re

taking down offensive statues—maybe we can excise that racist portrayal of aJapanese-American.”

Rooney’s Yunioshi is, in fact, a squirm-inducing portrayal for any twenty-first-century audience, with the most even-handed summary of the charactercoming from Phil Lee, the president of Media Action Network for AsianAmericans. Calling the film “beloved and charming . . . in other ways,” he al-lows that if someone young was seeing the film, “you’d explain the painfulhistorical context and how stereotypes prevent people from seeing reality.This is how I see the movie. I look on it not only as a movie people enjoy, butas a learning opportunity.”

Putting aside Mr. Yunioshi, if, as producer Jarow had it, this Holly was alopsided romantic, then what about the song called for in Axelrod’s script?Singing a song was no time for wearing a little black dress—this required thereal Holly/Lulamae to be dressed down in blue jeans, strumming a guitar.Needing an intimate song for a big moment, Edwards turned to Henry Man-cini, with whom he had happily worked on the previous year’s Bing Crosbyvehicle High Time. With dozens of films already to the thirty-six-year-oldMancini’s credit, his skills as composer, arranger, and conductor had estab-lished him as a rising musical star in Hollywood. There was just one prob-lem: the song wouldn’t come. A week went by. Two weeks. A month. Andwithout Mancini’s melody, lyricist Johnny Mercer was stuck in limbo. Usedto soaring melodies and lush orchestrations, Mancini struggled to answer thefilm’s musical question: What would this southern transplant turned NewYork sophisticate be singing about on a fire escape? Henry Mancini wasblocked.

Until—thinking of Audrey’s wistfulness and what he termed her “slightsadness,” he hit on a simple, slightly mournful three-note introduction, andout it all flowed, nestling perfectly into Audrey’s eight-note range. Written inthe same key as that utilized for her gentle rendition of Funny Face’s “HowLong Has This Been Going On,” the song was, said Mancini, “Very, verysimple . . . a sophisticated country song. You can play it all on the white keys. . . a trick that I wasn’t aware of—it just happened.” With the brilliant andoccasionally difficult Johnny Mercer now supplying a letter-perfect lyric, asong of disarming simplicity was turned into a three-act play. Touching, vul-nerable, and a distillation of longing both wistful and melancholy. It workedfor Holly, and it worked for Audrey, because both onscreen and in real life

Audrey Hepburn, better than almost any other actor, instinctively understoodthe inherently human condition of being perpetually sorry-grateful.

Hubert de Givenchy once paid tribute to his great friend by noting thateven after coming face-to-face with the horrors of war, Audrey had somehowclung to a certain optimism, explaining: “Despite the difficulties of life,Audrey always knew how to preserve in herself a part of childhood.”Givenchy had it right, because in the near universal desire to hold onto atleast some tendrils of childhood belief, audiences around the world recog-nized that very same quality in Audrey’s tender singing of “Moon River”;melancholy yet somehow hopeful, the song resonated precisely because un-derneath its deceptive surface simplicity, Audrey was able to locate and ac-cess a certain lingering sadness she also held within herself.

Shooting completed, Edwards and editor Howard Smith cut, trimmed, andrearranged right up until a first sneak preview. It all seemed to be unspoolingbeautifully, the audience swept along as soon as they glimpsed Audrey glid-ing up to Tiffany’s, a harmonica plaintively whispering “Moon River” beforemelting into the sound of a full orchestra swirling around the gorgeousmelody. Kudos all around, until the post-screening meeting, where Para-mount executive Marty Rackin fulminated “the fucking song has to go.” Atwhich point, in the Blake Edwards version of the meeting, gentle Audrey roseup to announce in ringing tones: “Over my dead body.” In the telling of oth-ers, it was producer Dick Shepherd who said: “You’ll cut that song over mydead body!” Whichever the accurate account, the bottom line remained clear:the song stayed.

“Moon River” was the start of a beautifully understated love fest betweenMancini and Audrey, with the composer following up this collaboration withelegant, mood-setting songs for Charade and Two for the Road. When itcame to “Moon River,” however, even after the number of recorded versionsof the song exceeded one thousand, Mancini’s thoughts remained happily fo-cused on only one version: “To this day, no one has done it with more feelingor understanding . . . hers is unquestionably the greatest.” Mancini is right;when Audrey sings “We’re after the same rainbow’s end/ waiting ’round thebend/ My huckleberry friend,” she is not just singing about Holly being sweptalong by the currents of life. She is singing to and about everyone.

In an elegant note written to Mancini, Audrey returned his compliment—with interest: “A movie without music is a little bit like an aeroplane without

fuel. However beautifully the job is done, we are still on the ground and in aworld of reality. Your music has lifted us all up and sent us soaring.Everything we cannot say with words or show with action you have ex-pressed for us.”

As the general release date of October 1961 approached, twelve monthshad passed since the start of shooting, and yet only now had the movie’s art-work been finalized. There would be small figures of Audrey and GeorgePeppard locked in embrace at the righthand side of the poster, a way of let-ting the audience know that Audrey/Holly was romantic, not a prostitute. Butthe image that would sell this film all around the world was a Robert McGin-nis illustration running from top to bottom: Audrey in the film-opening blackdress, her leg exposed, jewels around her neck, the personification of glam-our with a foot-long cigarette holder and opera-length gloves. And yet, it wasthe inclusion of a cat draped around her neck that provided the ne plus ultra,grounding the poster with an everyday image to which all could relate. Sure,Holly’s beautiful and a kook—but she loves her cat so how crazy could shebe?! (In an amusing aside, Blake Edwards said of the cat’s performance in thefilm-ending rainstorm: “Man, did that cat smell!”)

Paramount publicists went into overdrive: Audrey lookalike contests!Product tie-ins! Be a kook like Audrey at Tiffany’s! By now everyone hadheard about the movie, but one key question remained: Was it any good?

Yes. And no.

On the plus side—Audrey. Not just because of the magical opening andthe tender version of “Moon River.” There was real acting on display:hearing the news that her brother has died, Holly Golightly drops thesophisticated veneer and reveals the scared and vulnerable Lulamae, ayoung woman who is heartsick over losing her brother. It’s a remarkablepiece of screen acting that is often overlooked in the collective rush toworship, indeed almost fetishize, Audrey’s uber-glamorous look.Equally effective is the near end of the film, when Holly stands sobbingin the rain after pushing her cat out of a taxi. The sequence retains undi-minished power sixty years later because, in the words of the 50th An-niversary Companion book to the film: “The sheer pain of letting love inis written on her face.”

On the negative side of the ledger—Mickey Rooney. Wildly overacting,

he makes an audience uncomfortable every time he shows up on screen.

In the middle—George Peppard. More than a bit wooden, but so ex-traordinarily handsome in his early 1960s Mad Men kind of way that theaudience roots for him to successfully woo Holly.

In other words, when scored to a fare-thee-well by Henry Mancini, the sightof beautiful people in the midst of a glamorously pulsating New York Citycan go a long way toward overcoming flaws in the spinning of cinematicdreams.

And how do those very beautiful people end up? In Capote’s novella, thebittersweet story concludes with Holly having left New York City for Africa.But here, in Hollywoodland, there is, instead, a very traditional happy ending;it may not make sense, but the audience wants and needs the sight of two ri-diculously attractive people kissing in the rain, reunited with Holly’s “Cat”while “Moon River” swells on the soundtrack. And on the most elemental oflevels it actually works, because unrealistic as that happy ending is, the audi-ence sees behind the bluster, and understands not just Holly but alsoAudrey’s own personal tenderness.

The critics now weighed in, with A. H. Weiler of the New York Timessmartly noting: “A completely unbelievable but wholly captivating flight intofancy.” For all the quibbles, nearly all the critics seemed charmed by Audrey,with even the hard-to-please Judith Crist noting: “Audrey Hepburn may notbe your (or Truman Capote’s) notion of the amoral and pixyish Holly Go-lightly, but she’s still enchanting enough to make Breakfast at Tiffany’sworth watching.”

For better or worse, this film, then, was the version of the story that audi-ences around the world would know best—not to mention the version thatwould help keep the novella in print and Capote in royalties.

Through the decades, Truman retained his fondness for Audrey whilenever approving of either the film, Mickey Rooney, or Blake Edwards: “Thebook was really rather bitter. The movie became a mawkish valentine to NewYork City and as a result was thin and pretty whereas it should have been richand ugly.” In an interview years later with Lawrence Grobel, he minced nowords: “Although I’m very fond of Audrey Hepburn, she’s an extremelygood friend of mine, I was shocked and terribly annoyed when she was castin that part. It was high treachery on the part of the producers. They didn’t do

a single thing they promised. . . . The day I signed the contract they turnedaround and did exactly the reverse. They got a lousy director like Blake Ed-wards, who I could spit on!” This represents more than a bit of revisionisthistory on Capote’s part; there was no sign of shock or outrage in his accept-ance of royalty checks or in his letter to Audrey written shortly before filmingbegan. It was simply a part of doing business with Truman Capote to realizethat he always needed the last word. (Capote may not have liked the movie,but he ultimately proved even less fond of a 1963 Broadway musical adapta-tion which, despite the combined talents of Nunnally Johnson, Edward Albee,Mary Tyler Moore, and Richard Chamberlain, was closed by producer DavidMerrick before the official opening night. Capote heartily disliked both thescore and Mary Tyler Moore, and seemed to concur with Merrick’s assess-ment to close it “rather than subject the public to an excruciatingly boringevening.”)

Whatever Capote’s quibbles, the film soon earned five Academy Awardnominations, including nods for Best Screenplay and Art Direction, as well asa nomination for Audrey as Best Actress. Audrey flew to Los Angeles buthad a sore throat and stayed in her hotel rather than attend the ceremony. Itwas just as well—she lost to good friend Sophia Loren for her performance inTwo Women. Tiffany’s did not go away empty-handed, however, notchingwins for Best Song and Best Score, wins that seemed only fitting given thataside from the hypnotic opening sequence, the takeaway moment from thefilm remained Audrey’s heartfelt singing of “Moon River.”

Famous as the film is now, it is easy to forget that Breakfast at Tiffany’swas not a blockbuster at the time of its release. In the United States, it provedmore popular in big cities than in small towns and suburbs, and its $\$ 4$ milliondomestic gross was topped by a more substantial $\$ 6$ million gross in Europe.(In France the film carried the snazzy title: Diamonds on Toaste.) The film’ssuccess was enough to wipe out any lingering audience memories of the twinfailures of Green Mansions and The Unforgiven, and it remains a steadyseller on home video, its appeal continuing to grow through repeated televi-sion broadcasts.

That growing appeal has been boosted immeasurably by the allure of theGivenchy black dress, or more specifically, the Givenchy black dress as wornby Audrey Hepburn. Which leads to an interesting question: Why is the im-age of Audrey standing in front of Tiffany’s the single most iconic image of

her career and persona? Why not Audrey in Sabrina, dressed in the Givenchyball gown? Why not Audrey in any one of the spectacular outfits she wearsthroughout Charade?

The answer begins with the title, because the name Tiffany instantly con-jures up dazzling images of glamour and New York sophistication. AudreyHepburn in front of the Tiffany’s window is a confluence of all the elementsthat made her a star of the highest order: She’s mysterious and extraordinarilybeautiful, but the paper cup and the Danish pastry ground the image—here isa sophisticate who still retains warmth and girlishness.

Says Jeanine Basinger: “Film history works in mysterious ways. By thetime of Breakfast at Tiffany’s everyone knew Audrey Hepburn. She alreadywas iconic, and when she pulls up in the taxi, walks to the Tiffany’s windowin the highest of high fashion and wearing dark glasses, it’s the most arrestingof images. If Audrey Hepburn isn’t already Audrey Hepburn—the star asso-ciated with high fashion—this film is going nowhere. It’s either one of thegreatest starts in film history or it dies right there. And this image pulls to-gether Audrey’s high-class fashion with the human being right beneath thedazzling surface. You need Audrey Hepburn to make this work. She has be-come meaning as image—she’s associated with high fashion yet so likeableas a human being in her acting roles that the image and role become part ofthe culture. Audrey herself becomes culture—she’s an emoji.”

And now, thanks to the combined talents of Audrey and Hubert deGivenchy, black was no longer associated only with butlers and maids butwas instead turning into the color of power, one that signified rule breaking.A visual representation of independence. A woman in a black couture gownwho ate breakfast at Tiffany’s followed her own dictates and was a womanworthy of attention. Holly may have started out by running away from anysign of responsibility, but Audrey’s own inherently grounded personasignaled to the audience that Holly Golightly remained in charge of her owndestiny.

With the dawning of the women’s movement, young women on the cuspof adulthood identified ever more strongly with Holly’s desire for freedom,one typified by her plea to erstwhile husband “Doc” (a nicely subdued BuddyEbsen): “Please Doc. Please understand. I love you but I’m just not Lulamaeanymore. I’m not.” Amid changing times, Holly’s plea that others allow herto be her true self, to let her grow, change, and control her own life, contin-

ued to resonate.

The reach of the film grew in ever-widening circles around the globe, anddecades after the film’s original release, singer/actress Cher wrote a note toAudrey which detailed: “I so wanted to be like you in Breakfast at Tiffany’sthat I put my hair in two ponytails, bought huge sunglasses and wore theclosest thing to you I could put together. I got suspended from school for thesunglasses.”

With Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Audrey Hepburn had once again proved to bethe right actress in the right film at exactly the right time. As pointed out inSam Wasson’s study of the film, Breakfast at Tiffany’s did a lot to demolishthe Eisenhower-era complacency of Hollywood studio films, pointing theway to a more mature treatment of sex and female independence. In reality,however, the stronger blow was likely struck by the previous year’s AcademyAward-winning The Apartment, a cynically entertaining look at corporatepolitics, adultery, and relationships. That extraordinarily stylish and wittyBilly Wilder film had landed with such force that it led Judith Crist to pro-claim: “With that film we became grownups.” With the popularity of the late1960s films Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Graduate (1967), and MidnightCowboy (1969), the last vestiges of censorship crumbled, but it was TheApartment and Breakfast at Tiffany’s that fired the opening shots in the cul-ture wars.

In the end, through its curious but unbeatable combination of glamour, ro-mance, and wistful sadness, Breakfast at Tiffany’s provided Audrey with thesignature role of her career. After seeing the final cut, Audrey told agent KurtFrings: “This is the best thing I’ve ever done. . . .” As she explained to inter-viewers, “I’m an introvert . . . playing the extroverted girl in Breakfast atTiffany’s was the hardest thing I ever did.”

Always her own least-impressed fan, when musing about the film decadeslater she commented: “It’s the easiest of my pictures for me to look at. It’s theone I’m least embarrassed by.” And yet, she detailed, “the two things I al-ways think of when I see it are: 1. How could I have abandoned my cat? and2. Truman Capote really wanted Marilyn Monroe for the part.”

Audrey is here undercutting her own considerable achievement. What con-nects viewers to Holly is Audrey’s ability to convey the palpable sense ofloneliness underneath the bravado. Here were the lingering effects ofAudrey’s war-torn childhood, and viewers sensed that despite seeming to

have it all—beauty, money, glamour, and fame—she too was searching for ahuckleberry friend. In her own words: “I had very little real youth, fewfriends, little fun in the usual teenage way, and no security. Is it any wonder Ibecame an interior sort of person?”

As the decades passed and the cult of Holly/Audrey steadily gained power,Audrey’s continuing friendship with director Blake Edwards and his wife Ju-lie Andrews provided a pleasant reminder of a unique time in all of theirlives. In a touchingly humorous recollection after Audrey died, Edwards ex-plained that he last saw Audrey at a flower shop in Gstaad, Switzerland. Run-ning after her to say hello, he slipped and broke his ankle. Cried Audrey:“‘Oh, dear, Blackie, what have you done?’” Said Edwards in response: “Ob-viously I’m not the first or the last person to fall at your feet.”

They were never to see each other again.

# Chapter Twenty-ThreeFROM HOLLY TO KAREN, 1961

“She knew how to love. You didn’t have to be in constant contact with herto feel you had a friend. We always picked up right where we left off.”

—Shirley MacLaine on Audrey Hepburn

HOW WOULD AUDREY FOLLOW UP the success of Breakfast at Tiffany’s? With amusical? An out-and-out romantic comedy? Eschewing the easy choice, sheinstead chose what was, on paper, potentially the most controversial of all herfilms. The Children’s Hour. The subject: Lesbianism. The outcome? Notwhat anyone expected.

Certainly the material came with an impressive pedigree: based upon Lil-lian Hellman’s play of the same name, the story had previously been filmedas These Three, directed by William Wyler and starring Miriam Hopkins,Merle Oberon, and Joel McCrea. That 1936 movie had changed the play’ssubject matter of a possibly lesbian affair among schoolteachers to a rumoredadulterous heterosexual affair, but with the slow loosening of societal restric-tions over the next twenty-five years, it was decided that the remake wouldrevert to the play’s original subject matter.

In light of the recently concluded nightmare of the House Un-AmericanActivities Committee, the politically minded Wyler leapt at the chance toreexamine a story centering around the power of a lie. For her part, Audreywas so eager to work once again with Wyler that in a letter dated August 5,1960, she accepted the role of Karen before the screenplay had even beencompleted: “I’m just thrilled and so terribly happy. . . . Man, oh man.”Audrey’s contract called for a fee of $\$ 500,000$ against ten percent of thegross, with her salary burnished by substantial perks: a car with chauffeur,$1,000 per week in personal expenses, 100,000 lira for the services of her

Italian hairdresser, and direct payment of all travel expenses incurred by herpersonal secretary.

When scheduling problems prevented Lillian Hellman from fulfilling dir-ector Wyler’s request that she write the screenplay, the film was assigned toJohn Michael Hayes, who had found great success writing the Hitchcockfilms Rear Window (1954), To Catch a Thief (1955), and The Man WhoKnew Too Much (1956). Through no fault of Hayes, the screenplay washampered right from the start when it was decreed that no Production CodeSeal of Approval would be forthcoming if the word “lesbian” was uttered.Suggested, yes. Stated aloud, no. Translation: the entire idea behind the filmwas neutered before production ever started. Such general uneasiness waseven reflected in the list of all the titles that were considered for the film: In-famous, With Sinful Knowledge, Strange Awareness, and Whispers in theDark. (When the film was released in the UK, it was known, none too subtly,as The Loudest Whisper.)

Nonetheless, hopes remained high, and a top-tier trio of stars was signed:co-starring with the top billed Audrey (playing “Karen Wright”) were ShirleyMacLaine (“Martha Dobie”) and James Garner (“Dr. Joe Cardin”). The threestars immediately took to one another—or more precisely, in the case ofMacLaine, “immediately” translated into a three-hour trial period: “I hadplenty of qualms when I met Audrey for the first rehearsal for The Children’sHour. It took me quite a while to thaw her out—about three hours. From thenon, it was one big kick.” The two women worked together easily, and in thehumorous recall of Shirley, it was decided that between takes Audrey wouldteach Shirley how to dress, while “I tried to teach her how to be eloquentlyprofane.” Those differences in personality were reflected in their approach toacting, with Wyler pointing out: “Audrey, like most actresses, will require amoment to get herself in the proper mood for the scene, but Shirley—she willmake jokes and clown it up until the last second. And then, when the camerastarts, she will be right in it. It’s often disconcerting for the other peoplearound.”

Garner, cast in the somewhat thankless role of Audrey’s boyfriend, ad-mired her skill and, in his own words, “fell in love with her. She was quietand demure, a very proper lady, though she had a great sense of humor.” Hewas, not, however, a fan of Mel Ferrer’s: “I could never figure out how shecould have married that guy Mel Ferrer. She was way too good for him.”

Mutual respect between the stars did not, however, ease the trials of film-ing. The role of Karen Wright proved intense, and with few laughs to leaventhe proceedings, Wyler’s endless retakes proved exhausting. Wrote the film’sstills photographer Bob Willoughby of Audrey’s on-set routine: “She wouldjust disappear, and when I went looking, I would find her hidden away in anunlit part of the set. She needed to get away from all the distractions and pre-pare herself to face the scene again.”

In the early 1960s the story of lives being destroyed by a malicious childspreading unfounded rumors of a lesbian affair was still ahead of its time, andthe film was weakened by Wyler’s surprisingly skittish treatment of the idea.In subsequent years, Shirley MacLaine stated that Wyler, fearing the wrath ofthe Production Code, became very uneasy at any mention of lesbianism, andcut the scenes showing Martha brushing Karen’s hair and taking care of herclothes. In typically blunt fashion she emphasized that Wyler “chickened out”and “gutted scenes in the middle of the picture which showed that Marthawas in love with Karen.” MacLaine did, however, blame herself for part ofthe film’s resulting blandness: “I should have fought more with Willie Wylerto investigate the lesbian relationship. John Michael Hayes had not pulledany punches in the script. In one scene, I baked a chocolate cake for Audrey,cut it like a work of art, placed the slices on doilies just so. Every nuance wasthe act of a lover.”

Yes, the film’s timidness hurts, but it is misguided to criticize the filmthrough a twenty-first-century prism that, in E. P. Thompson’s apt phrase,represents the enormous condescension of posterity. If the fact that Marthacommits suicide at the end of the film because she is gay continues to rankletoday, it is still noteworthy that in the early 1960s, even hinting at homosexu-ality, let alone discussing it boldly, constituted a genuine step forward in Hol-lywood.

Given the Production Code’s straitjacket, the film still contains some mo-ments of surprising effectiveness. When Karen (Audrey) finds out that every-one is withdrawing their children from the school because of rumors of lesbi-anism, there is no over-the-top emoting. Instead, Wyler stages the scene si-lently, shooting at a distance, and thereby underscoring the difficulties facedin confronting whispered half-truths and innuendos: everyone hears and inter-prets the events differently. Similarly, the confrontation between Grand-mother Amelia Tilford (a first-rate Fay Bainter) and the two girls spreading

the rumors is powerful and rings true.

Even better is the moment when Karen realizes that Martha may havecommitted suicide; she runs back to the house and the door is battered down,but Martha is already dead. Making the scene all the more powerful is thefact that overt histrionics are eschewed by means of an immediate and highlyeffective cut to Martha’s funeral. Karen’s school has been destroyed, her en-gagement to Dr. Joe called off, and she has lost her best friend to suicide; thepower of lies to destroy lives has been solidly conveyed. Why then, does thefilm refuse to hang together?

The biggest reason: these high points prove too intermittent to be effect-ive, and the film’s screenplay proves a big hindrance. For all of his talent,Hayes’s sensibility is not a natural fit for the material, and the bowdlerizationof the material made his task all the more difficult. Said Hellman of the finalscript: “[It is] mostly workable [but] . . . has a strange flat quality. Mr. Hayeshas a bad ear.”

The usually estimable Alex North, a fifteen-time Oscar nominee, turns in arather ponderous score, and while Audrey is solid if not particularly memor-able, she does rely too heavily upon her tested bag of tricks, signaling a tried-and-true moist-eyed concern rather than a conflicted young woman.MacLaine does better by the frustrated-in-love Karen, but it’s a surprise thatthe skill Wyler displayed guiding Audrey in Roman Holiday was here inshort supply, perhaps done in by the necessity of tiptoeing around the subjectof homosexuality. Hollywood, it was clear, had not yet fully grown up.

Most damaging of all, however, the film is irrevocably thrown off balanceby the screeching performance of newcomer Karen Balkin as the young girlwho starts the rumors. It is unfortunate that first choice Hayley Mills was notavailable because Balkin’s performance remains a mere shadow of BonitaGranville’s highly effective turn in These Three. Telegraphing every move inadvance, Balkin’s characterization is rendered at such an over-the-top pitchthat she ultimately comes to represent a juvenile version of F. Scott Fitzger-ald’s quip about writing for Joan Crawford: “You can never give her such astage direction as ‘telling a lie’ because if you did, she would practically givea representation of Benedict Arnold selling West Point to the British.”Wyler’s failure to reign in Balkin, a shortcoming made worse by filmingmany of her tantrums in close-up, ruins the very heart of the film.

As the film geared up for its premiere on December 19, 1961, the finalized

artwork told the story of pulled punches: against a shocking pink background,MacLaine and Hepburn are represented by stylized drawings, the former inprofile, the latter facing forward with demurely lowered eyes. Between thetwo women lies one word: “Different.” Off to the side under the title lies awarning: “Because of the nature of the theme—this movie is not recommen-ded for children.” Or for anyone else according to the blandly negative re-views. (Wyler biographer Jan Herman unearthed a humorously titled negativereview headlined: “The Lesbian Said the Better.”) Respect was accorded thetwo stars, but after praising MacLaine, Time magazine, lit into Audrey: “ButAudrey Hepburn gives her standard frail, indomitable characterization, whichis to say that her eyes water constantly (frailty) and her chin is forever canti-levered forward.”

Wyler himself knew he had not succeeded, later calling the film “a dis-aster.” He was exaggerating for effect, but he did agree with Hellman’s criti-cism that he had been “too faithful to the original and made no attempt tomodernize and bring it up to date. . . . She said that if she had done thescreenplay she would have changed a lot of things . . .”

Surprisingly, the film received five Academy Award nominations, al-though not for the three stars. Instead, Fay Bainter was nominated for herskillful performance as Grandmother Amelia, and additional nominationswere scored by Franz Planer (Black and White Cinematography), Art Direc-tion, Sound Design, and surprisingly, Costume Design; given the downbeat,nearly one-set look of the film, Audrey had agreed to forego Givenchy andinstead work with Dorothy Jeakins for the third time. Karen’s bland, utilit-arian wardrobe would certainly not do anything for Audrey’s reputation asone of the world’s leading fashion plates, and nomination or not, it was clearby now that the talented Oscar-winning Jeakins played second fiddle toGivenchy when it came to costuming Audrey on film: Givenchy nabbed Sab-rina, Charade, and How to Steal a Million while Jeakins was stuck withGreen Mansions, The Unforgiven, and The Children’s Hour.

In the end, The Children’s Hour proved to be a case of good intentionsand misplaced results, the situation best summed up by James Garner post-opening: “If I was taking part at this moment, I doubt that I’d take that on.But I wasn’t really looking for the part so much as the association. I wantedto be in good company.”

The somber end results had simply proved too uneven for audiences to de-

rive any sustained pleasure from the movie, which meant that a quick changeof pace back to the congenial territory of romantic comedy seemed exactlythe right shot in the arm for Audrey’s career. Next up—Paris When It Sizzles:a combination of Paris and Givenchy, not to mention an onscreen reunionwith William Holden.

Hopes ran high—at least at the start.

# PARIS WHEN IT FIZZLES, 1962–1964

“The trouble is that Paris When It Sizzles seems constantly on the verge ofhilarity, but it never gets entirely into it.”

—Hollywood Reporter, April 8, 1964

AFTER THE BIRTH OF SEAN, Audrey had pronounced herself happier at home thanon any film set. Which meant that if she were going to spend time away fromhome making a movie, the material in question had to provide either a senseof fun or a thought-provoking message. In that light, Breakfast at Tiffany’sand Charade made perfect sense, but her choice of Paris When It Sizzles pro-duces only one reaction: Why? Why spend time away from home on an ill-advised reunion with an alcoholic William Holden who still carried the torchfor her?

Top billed over Audrey, Holden was here playing “Richard Benson,” ahard-drinking screenwriter who must write an overdue screenplay in onlyforty-eight hours. Given the parallel between the character and Holden’s ownalcoholic personal life, the conceit underlying the entire story should haveraised alarm signals, yet that problem was conveniently ignored in the stu-dio’s pursuit of hoped-for box office glory. Perhaps the powers that be heldsuch blind faith in Audrey’s star power that they felt audiences would turnout to see a reunion of Sabrina’s romantic leads, but as written, Audrey’s roleof “Gabrielle Simpson,” a secretary hired to help Benson overcome hiswriter’s block, should have immediately told them otherwise. Extensive asher skills were, even Audrey could not ring much charm out of a secretaryco-opted into playing out the fantasies Benson dreams up for his screenplay.

Screenwriter George Axelrod had proved himself a talented writer withboth Breakfast at Tiffany’s and especially the brilliant Manchurian Candidate

(1962), but he came a cropper here. His screenplay, based upon the 1951French film La Fete a Henriette, and intended as a spoof of both moviemak-ing and sex farces, was stuffed with forced shenanigans in which Audrey andHolden pranced around exotic locations in a wild mix of spy chase, traffic ac-cidents, and love story. The only thing missing was coherence.

Although by 1962 Audrey’s marriage to Mel Ferrer was under increasingstrain, she now proved dismayed, not enchanted, by the protestations of lovestill coming from Holden on the set of Paris When It Sizzles. Audrey, itseemed, felt nothing so much as sorrow about what had happened to herformer love. Frequently inebriated, Holden caused delays on the set and tookto drunken nighttime attempts at rekindling his love affair with Audrey. Itwas clear by now that the uber-masculine but surprisingly insecure Holdenhad never fully grown up, while the seemingly fragile Audrey Hepburn wasall about growing up, moving forward, and taking charge of her own life.

In fact, matters appeared jinxed right from the start when, during filming,Audrey’s house in Switzerland was burglarized and her Academy Awardstolen. The Oscar, which was eventually found in nearby woods, had beenstolen by Jean-Claude Thouroude, an obsessed twenty-two-year-old fan whohad moved to Switzerland to be near his idol. Audrey took the burglary instride, but what she did not take in stride during the filming of Sizzles was herdispleasure with the work of cinematographer Claude Renoir (grandson ofpainter Pierre-Auguste Renoir). In the words of the film’s director RichardQuine: “Audrey’s strong, very strong, and she was not happy with the wayshe looked. . . . Paris When It Sizzles called for a lot of movement and use ofkey lights, and as a result he got unsettled and photographed Audrey veryroughly.”

Renoir was replaced by Charles Lang, whom Audrey had favored eversince his work on Sabrina, and while, thanks to Lang’s skills and key light-ing, Audrey ended up looking nearly as youthful as she had eight yearsearlier on that film, Lang could do nothing to disguise the toll that Holden’syears of hard drinking had taken; in the end, special lighting and all, Holden’sweathered visage—a golden boy no longer—causes concern, not envy, in theviewer’s mind.

This Paris did not so much sizzle as strain laboriously, with the stars vali-antly trying to breathe life into a premise that needed a lighter-than-air ap-proach and instead slammed viewers over the head as if to shout: “Are you

having fun yet?” By now the thirty-three-year-old Audrey was too old andsmart to play the type of naif she is saddled with here, and the plot, whichfeatures digs at Method actors and avant-garde films, at one point foundAudrey playing a fighter pilot, the tone of the sequence resembling nothingso much as a subpar Saturday Night Live skit.

Axelrod, who had successfully walked a very fine line with his script forBreakfast at Tiffany’s, could not solve his story’s conceptual problems, and tohelp gin up the proceedings, director Quine resorted to the use of star cameos.Marlene Dietrich, Tony Curtis, Mel Ferrer, and Noël Coward all whiz by, andat times it seems as if the crème de la crème of 1960s Hollywood had shownup to help out. Nelson Riddle provides the score, Frank Sinatra sings one lineof the title song for the film within a film—The Girl Who Stole the EiffelTower—and Fred Astaire even sings “That Face,” his charming vocal syncedwith a close-up of Audrey’s face. It was all for naught.

The labored and rather leaden shenanigans of Paris When It Sizzles ulti-mately reduce the number of pleasurable moments to a very fleeting few:amusing inside references to Funny Face and Breakfast at Tiffany’s, as wellas the sight of Audrey crossing the room in a nightgown as if floating on air,grace intact even in the midst of utter nonsense. But everyone tries too hard,and the wild party meant to echo the bacchanal in Breakfast at Tiffany’s playsout as desperate rather than enticing. In the end, the finished film mostclosely resembles a soufflé which stubbornly refuses to rise, and when asingle onscreen credit for perfume generated more interest among critics thanthe film itself, a doomed outcome was guaranteed.

As to that perfume. Givenchy, who here outfitted Audrey in a series ofdazzling creations constituting the one visually appealing aspect of the film,received his standard separate credit. This time, however, it was credit with adifference: “Miss Hepburn’s wardrobe and perfume by Hubert de Givenchy.”Which means that Paris When It Sizzles’s claim to film history lies in itsstatus as possibly the first ever film to display a separate credit for a fra-grance.

In the words of the film’s publicists, the perfume, christened “L’Inter-dit”—French for “forbidden”—represented a creation “in the image ofAudrey Hepburn as a tribute to her beauty and as something interdit to othersand thereby exclusive.” Audrey Hepburn, and not a single other person,would wear Givenchy’s scent. Although advertised in the New Yorker as far

back as June of 1963, the perfume was not released to the public until 1967,and while television viewers in the twenty-first century may be inured to theendless advertisements for celebrity perfumes, in the early 1960s, the noveltyof the idea proved startling.

L’Interdit did not represent the first Audrey-sanctioned endorsement; shehad, at the time of Funny Face, already endorsed Lux Soap. But she choseand controlled her few endorsements with great care; when she agreed to filmcommercials for a Japanese wig company in 1976—with her dark hair andeyes, exquisite manners, and soft-spoken mien, Audrey remained immenselypopular in Japan—she made certain that the ads could never be shown any-where but in Japan.

Filming on Paris When It Sizzles was completed in 1962, but faced with afarce they knew was a flop, Paramount did not release the film until 1964,when they hoped to capitalize upon the enormous recent success of Charade.The attempt did not work, box office receipts proved soggy, and the filmquickly disappeared. Said Sean diplomatically after his mother’s death: “Shedidn’t care much for Paris When It Sizzles.”

The film may have flopped, but even in the face of such disappointment,director Quine remained an ardent fan of Audrey’s: “Audrey . . . was thecharmer of the world. Of all the people I’ve worked with in my life, Audreyand Jack Lemmon were my favorites. They don’t have a false bone in theirbodies, absolutely not a flaw, professional, kind, gentle, considerate, no tem-perament at all.”

Kind and gentle she was, but what Audrey Hepburn needed was a betterscript and a hit film. She landed both, and then some, with her next film, herlong-anticipated pairing with Cary Grant in Charade. Together again—forthe very first time—were cinema’s two most stylish purveyors of movie starchic.

Charade, it turned out, would register as that rarest of cinematic feats—aconfection of undiluted charm.

“Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are two people who will never bebettered on the screen—the epitome of beauty and handsomeness and cul-ture.”

—Stanley Donen

WHEN PRODUCTION ON CHARADE BEGAN in October of 1962, the general reactionto the teaming of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn seemed to be a smiling ex-clamation of “What took so long?” It certainly hadn’t been for lack of trying,with the duo having previously been mentioned as possible co-stars for Ro-man Holiday, Sabrina, and Love in the Afternoon. And yet, none of thoseproposed pairings had come close to happening because of Grant’s reserva-tions regarding both the scripts and the twenty-five-year gap in their ages.

Most notably, with both Sabrina and Love in the Afternoon, Grant’s hesit-ation about working with Billy Wilder had tipped the scales. Said Grant toWilder at the time of Love in the Afternoon: “Don’t persist. Look, I like you,Wilder, but I cannot explain it. I just . . . the wrong signals come up in me.”Grant’s well-known antipathy toward autocratic directors (he had dislikedworking with the overbearing Michael Curtiz on Night and Day in 1946)meant that he had not welcomed the prospect of a months-long shoot withWilder. In the star’s own words: “I’d heard he didn’t like actors very muchand I’d already worked with enough of those kinds of directors to last a life-time. Humphrey Bogart did Sabrina and he looks very unhappy all the waythrough.”

Wilder, however, was not attached to Charade, and although writer PeterStone had failed to interest any publisher in Charade as a novel, StanleyDonen had glimpsed the story’s potential as a film, writing Stone that it

“might make a very interesting suspense action film, if one was fortunateenough to get an extremely good screenplay, and, of course, a marvelous wo-man to play the leading part. I have in mind Audrey Hepburn, and I am hope-ful that I will be able to interest her in doing it.”

Donen paid Stone $\$ 750$ per week plus expenses to write a script basedupon his novel, with Stone finishing his draft in 1962. Grant liked Stone’sscript, had worked well with Donen on Indiscreet (1958) and The Grass IsGreener (1960), and having passed on the Howard Hawks–directed Man’sFavorite Sport (1964), the stars finally aligned for his much-anticipated team-ing with Audrey.

Said Donen: “I don’t know anyone who lived in those years who doesn’tthink of Audrey and Cary as the most enchanting people, and to be able tohave them together in a movie was beyond anyone’s dreams.” The wait hadbeen so worthwhile that Audrey accepted second billing without a quibble.

Stone’s witty script, an entertaining mixture of comedy and thrills, castAudrey against type as the suddenly widowed “Reggie Lambert,” who findsherself broke, homeless, and chased by no fewer than three men. When“Peter Joshua” shows up in the person of Cary Grant, the games begin inearnest. Is Peter a friend or a wolf in sheep’s clothing? The issue would onlybe solved at the very end of the film’s one hundred and thirteen minutes, thesolution nearly taking second place to the dazzling clothes, gorgeousEuropean locales, and witty byplay between Grant and Hepburn.

With small tweaks made to the script, Grant’s reservations about being adirty old man twenty-five years Audrey’s senior had soon disappeared. It wasAudrey’s character of Reggie who would be the romantic aggressor; charm-ingly forthright in her seduction of Grant, Audrey projected a mix of girlishpluck and womanly assertiveness, and in the process provided a perfect foilfor Grant’s exasperated reactions. She is upfront about her romantic feelingsbut is neither overly aggressive nor operating from a fear of rejection. In theend, the ageless charm of Grant gave Charade a romantic fizz that had eludedthe pairings of Audrey with Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda, and yet for a filmwhich has acquired a reputation as a romantic classic, the surprise lies in thefact that Grant and Hepburn never kiss.

Instead, the script doles out witty lines to both stars, their romantic spar-ring escalating with each scenic chase and shoot-out. As Reggie contemplatesPeter’s face, zeroing in on Grant’s famously cleft chin, she wonders aloud:

Reggie: How do you shave in there?

Peter: Like porcupines make love. Very carefully!

It’s deft, sexy, and never vulgar, yet the soon to crumble Production Codestill would not allow the line, deeming it too suggestive. Instead, the ex-change was reduced to:

Reggie: How do you shave in there?

Peter: Very carefully!

The affection the stars held for each other is palpable on screen, and there is alightness to both of their performances throughout. As Audrey perceptivelynoted: “While you might not think it, Cary was a vulnerable man, and he re-cognized my own vulnerability. We had that in common.” Grant, a long-es-tablished past master of the romantic comedy opposite actresses ranging fromKatharine Hepburn to Doris Day, seemed to revel in the screenplay’s playfulstructure. Time after time a romantic build-up was deftly undercut by an of-ten-subversive quip, lending the film a tone of chuckles, not belly laughs, thatfit both stars to a T.

What looked effortless and chic as they dazzled onscreen was of courseachieved with hard work and a mutual understanding which deepened theironscreen affect. In a comment which Audrey never forgot, Grant one dayleaned over to her on the set between shots and gently informed his ever-nervous co-star: “You’ve got to learn to like yourself a little more.” Audrey’sintimates knew of her constant self-criticism, but it was not every co-star whorecognized the worries underneath the glittering surface. It was this mutualawareness that helped to inform their spirited repartee, and in a further burstof candid appraisal, Grant summarized: “In spite of her fragile appearanceshe’s like steel. She may bend, but she never breaks.”

That combination of fragility and steel was beautifully captured by theGivenchy wardrobe, which presented Audrey as the epitome of Europeanchic in a whirlwind of collarless jackets, sleek-fitting dresses, oversizedsunglasses, and pillbox hats. So noticeable are Givenchy’s designs that in ret-rospect it seems as if accurate advertisements for the film should have boldlyproclaimed: “Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, and Hubert de Givenchy in

Charade!”

After Sabrina, Funny Face, Love in the Afternoon, and Paris When ItSizzles, Charade represented Audrey’s fifth film set in Paris. Part of Paris’sdazzle was thanks to the painterly cinematography of Charles Lang, here re-united with Audrey after their collaboration on Sabrina (Wait Until Dark wasto follow). Lang’s photography caught Paris at its most alluring, and whencombined with a Givenchy-clad Audrey, titles by the great Maurice Binder,and a haunting score by Henry Mancini, Charade ended up a glossy, satisfy-ing, and effortless bauble of the type thought of as “typical Hollywood” butrarely achieved. It’s a confection, but with just enough substance beneath theadmittedly glittering surface to linger in the memory.

That charm is encapsulated in the Mancini/Johnny Mercer title tune whichperfectly captures the lingering sadness underneath the film’s—and Audrey’s—gaiety:

Best on the bill, lovers until

Love left the masquerade

Said Mancini himself: “I think Charade is the best work John (Mercer)and I ever did together.”

Charade may not have broken any new ground, and yes, the plot occasion-ally registers as convoluted, but with the larger-than-life personalities of thetwo stars, and the charm with which the material is presented, audiences, asone commentator accurately pegged it, “feel in on the joke.” In typical fash-ion, Audrey praised her director while deflecting any thought that she con-tributed substantially to the film’s success: “I was bloody lucky, let’s face it.With Stanley, certainly, and with practically all my co-stars and directors, butwith Stanley on a somewhat more personal level. I do know that my privatelife was not always happy, but with Stanley I would always be happy on theset. Stanley made me laugh, and that, for me, was an enormous turn-on.”

Donen knew Audrey’s strengths as an actress, and in this second pairingthere was an ease of method and communication. Explains Sean Ferrer: “Ofcourse the directors listened to her input, and with the directors she workedwith frequently, like Donen, it was very easy for the director to make slightadjustments—more color here, greater emphasis there. It was like a recipe. Ifthe pancake is too thick you add a little milk and it becomes a crepe.”

For his part, Donen, who could turn surprisingly acerbic with others,praised Audrey extravagantly; he was more than a little bit in love with histhree-time leading lady, while still perceptively noting: “I longed to getcloser, to get behind whatever was the invisible, but decidedly present, bar-rier between her and the rest of us, but I never got to the deepest part ofAudrey . . . she always kept a little of herself in reserve which was hers alone.. . . She was the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”

The sixth of Audrey’s films to premiere at Radio City Music Hall,Charade proved to be a big hit, one that even the often-exasperated PaulineKael deemed “probably the best American film of last year—as artificial andenjoyable in its way as The Big Sleep . . . [containing] a freshness and spiritthat make them unlike the films of any other country.” For her efforts,Audrey received a Golden Globe nomination as well as a third Best ActressBAFTA.

Grant, not often easily pleased with his own efforts, had found the pairingwith Audrey so enjoyable that he wanted her as his co-star in the upcomingFather Goose (that film ultimately brought Charade screenwriter Peter Stonean Oscar). Audrey, alas, said no, and was, unsurprisingly, replaced by LeslieCaron. For all her gamine charm, Caron appeared noticeably tougher thanAudrey and perhaps fit the movie’s stranded on an island routine more com-fortably. Throughout the next decade, studios continued their attempts toreteam Hepburn and Grant, and MGM did in fact ask them to co-star in its1969 musical remake of Goodbye, Mr. Chips. The resulting film, which ulti-mately co-starred Peter O’Toole and Petula Clark, did contain a few pleasantsongs but remained stubbornly earthbound. It was better for all concernedthat Grant was not tempted out of retirement for that musical extravaganza.

Audrey’s mutual admiration society with Cary Grant continued throughoutthe years, with Grant once stating: “All I want for Christmas is another pic-ture with Audrey Hepburn.” Audrey gracefully returned the compliment:“Cary was a lovely souvenir in my life”—but perhaps the best summary oftheir magical pairing comes in the words of Peter Stone’s screenplay:

Reggie: Do you know what’s wrong with you?

Peter: What?

Reggie: Nothing!

Audiences for sixty years seemed to agree.

—Audrey Hepburn

THE SUCCESS OF CHARADE HAD more than made up for the twin disappointmentsof The Children’s Hour and Paris When It Sizzles, but Audrey’s focus re-mained not on her career but on achieving her one remaining heart’s desire:finding a permanent home.

After decades spent traveling from country to country, with rental proper-ties leased one right after another in dizzying profusion—in 1965 alone Meland Audrey were to rent houses in Rome, Madrid, and Paris—Audrey wanteda permanent home. She was nearing forty, a wife and mother, and tired ofpacking and unpacking dozens upon dozens of trunks. Mel, immersed in theshow business swim as actor, director, and producer, liked constantly beingon the move, but Audrey wanted roots. Deep ones.

She had loved Switzerland from the start. Bürgenstock did provide anoasis of natural beauty, one far more restful than glamorous Gstaad, but itstill felt like less than a permanent answer. The intense mountainside wintershad also proved so extreme that Audrey longed for a more temperate climate,albeit while still residing in Switzerland.

She had already learned that her privacy would be honored by the cour-teous and respectful Swiss. With an always polite, seemingly friendly, but re-served demeanor arising out of an inherent sense of self-protection, Audrey

was proving to be a unicorn among film stars: a worldwide celebrity whosespace and privacy the public inherently respected. In the words of StanleyDonen: “She had the ability to keep people at a distance without being in theleast bit rough or unkind.” More than any other actress of her time, she main-tained a highly private life, but one that was blended with a sometimes start-ling emotional availability.

An intensive search for the proper house began. Starting point of thesearch: still haunted by memories of the war, Audrey refused to reside in theGerman-speaking part of Switzerland. Home had to lie in another part of thecountry, which meant that month after month, when slivers of free time couldbe snatched, Audrey and Mel headed out on scouting expeditions, driving forhours through country lanes dotted with homes that looked promising yetnever proved fully suitable.

After months of fruitless searching by Audrey and Mel, friends nowweighed in, telling Audrey that there was a farmhouse which might be forsale in the small town of Tolochenaz-sur-Morges, a short ten-minute drivefrom Lausanne. On a clear autumn day, Mel and Audrey drove as close aspossible to the property, with Audrey standing on the hood of their car to bet-ter take in the house and surrounding property. In Sean’s words: “She endedup on the wrong side of the house at the bottom of the garden. The cherrytrees were in bloom—she could barely see the house. But she just had a feel-ing.”

What she did see, set on two and a half acres of property lined with fruittrees, was an eighteenth-century Vaudois farmhouse, with shutters framingthe windows of a two-story dwelling built of peach-colored brick. A stonewall fronting on the town’s only street, the Route de Biere, marked the prop-erty line. Audrey gazed at the slate roof, at the house’s clean lines and knew:it was as if she had been attempting to navigate the world in a foreign lan-guage—or in Audrey’s case, five foreign languages—and had suddenlyfound herself in the homeland of her native tongue. A girl born in Brussels,raised in the Netherlands and England, who spoke five languages and workedin Africa, Mexico, France, Italy, and the United States, had found the homeof her dreams in Switzerland. It was 1963, and in the words of Sean, thethirty-four-year-old Audrey “remembered feeling butterflies in her stomachand felt she had come home.”

Papers were signed, and for 18,500 pounds the house was now hers. The

farmhouse, Audrey decided, would be known as La Paisible—the peacefulplace. Private. Surrounded by mountains and rolling countryside, and farfrom Hollywood and its incessant talk of box office grosses. Here lay small-town life with room for Sean to grow and explore, far removed from the glareof her celebrity. Yes, there would still be happy weeks spent at a condomin-ium in Gstaad, but Tolochenaz was, now and forever after, home.

Says Sean: “When my parents found the house in Tolochenaz, near LakeLeman in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, it seemed just right. It wasnear where Yul Brynner, Elizabeth Taylor, and Noël Coward were living. Itwas really a farmhouse with animals living right there. It was stone with rel-atively low ceilings, seven or eight feet—and my mother converted the entirehouse. The work was really accomplished in record time.”

In Audrey’s hands, the décor throughout the eight-bedroom house provedto be high end but comfortable. Scattered throughout was her favorite color,cyan—a subtle, clean, and cool blue/green shade that looks remarkably sim-ilar to the color of Tiffany boxes. There were to be cyan accents on her lin-ens, her pillows, and even the shutters of the house. The living room coucheswere a cheerful yellow or pink, their bright colors offset by the white interiorwalls. In Audrey’s own words: “Simple, homey, cottagey.”

Her Academy Award was nestled in the middle of a shelf of books in theplayroom, far from the living room where visitors would have seen it. SaidLuca: “My mother chose to keep the acknowledgements she received for herhumanitarian work in the living room, as ultimately, they meant far more toher.”

Shortly after moving in, she excitedly went to work on her garden, hiring aprofessional to redesign it yet happy to do quite a bit of the work herself. Outwent any red flowers, and in went a sea of white bulbs, centering around thewhite Dutch tulips sent by brothers Ian and Alex. So well-known didAudrey’s love of flowers grow to be that two flowers were named after her inHolland: the white and long-necked Audrey Hepburn Tulip (cultivated in1990) and the Audrey Hepburn Rose. Exclaimed Audrey about her namesaketulip: “This was the single most romantic thing to happen in my life.” Lucadescribes the Audrey Hepburn roses as “beautiful . . . because they are a deeppink in bud, but when they open up they become a softer pink and then al-most white. My mother positively loved them so much as she grew them inher garden and because if you make a bouquet, you can have lots of different

hues.”

Vegetable and cutting gardens, as well as orchards and meadows, all madefor a sense of peace and safety. Nearing forty, and even with her career stillin high gear, she liked the idea of slowing down and living in Tolochenazwith Sean. Staying home because she finally had a home. In her own veryevocative phrase: “The more there is, the less I want. The more man flies tothe moon, the more I want to look at a tree.” It was almost as if Audrey, likeRobinson Crusoe, felt that one had to be in actual contact with nature—to lit-erally hear the birds and smell the flowers—in order to fully know and under-stand oneself, to attempt the impossible task of being fully grateful for eachday.

Beautiful as La Paisible was in its classical simplicity, it was the coun-tryside itself that spoke even more strongly to Audrey. Said Luca: “Mymother was at the very deep of her heart a farm girl. . . . She grew up with agreat love for everything linked to the countryside—furniture, style. That’swhy at the end she chose to live in Switzerland in the middle of the fields.”This was not a Hollywood star playacting at the farm life, and in Luca’swords: “We had a lot of fruit trees and with those we made and ate freshlymade marmalade, apple juice and we had a vegetable garden too. During thewinter the tomatoes were frozen to be used fresh. We spent a lot of time pre-paring the preserves and marmalades—which is something that is now backinto fashion.”

She took long walks through the secluded Swiss countryside—the legacyof her childhood war years caused her to “hate anything that crowds me.”Still looking upon her own fame, in the words of Sean, as a freak accident ofnature, she was happy in her solitude, and the townspeople of Tolochenaz lefther to her own devices, granting her privacy on the trips to the market thatshe so enjoyed. Said Luca: “She loved going to the market herself. It wasvery important to know the people she was buying from, talking to them, tak-ing advice, making conversation.” Shopping and cooking assumed pride ofplace for Audrey, with Luca further recalling “she had a true passion forenormous supermarkets where she could now push her cart around at will,fascinated by the abundant offerings.”

There was help and plenty of it: maid/companion Giovanna Orunesu, thegardener-chauffeur Giovanni and his wife Rucchita, their two children Mari-lena and Pierluigi, housekeeper Engracia de la Rocha, and when living in

Italy, a nanny for Luca. But in Sean’s words: “My mother didn’t order peoplearound. She chose to do a lot of the housework herself.”

Never one to frequent a gym, she did not play sports but kept fit throughher long walks. Said Sean: “Throughout her formative years she was dancingconstantly and as an adult she remained very active. She had a wonderful fig-ure because she walked everywhere.” The walks, in fact, were conducted atsuch a brisk clip that her companions would find themselves nearly trotting inorder to keep up with her. Asked by Sean why she walked so quickly, shereplied, “I just want to get there,” but perhaps an even deeper reason lay in alater conversation when she confessed that her ultra-brisk pace grew out of areaction to her own mother’s studied and leisurely pace.

The food she loved to cook? At the top of the list—pasta. Spaghetti al po-modoro reigned as her all-time favorite. Explained Sean: “She was a wonder-ful, talented, very healthy cook. We didn’t know as much then about foodgroups and nutrition, but she said eating a plate of all white isn’t very inter-esting, so it can’t be very good for you.”

Simple foods, like the clean lines of her home and clothes.

Whiskey—yes. Cigarettes—unfortunately. A smoker her entire life, themore nervous she became, the less she ate and the more she smoked. Sheknew she shouldn’t, and yet she could not stop; as far back as the 1958 film-ing of The Nun’s Story, she had chastised her castmate and friend PatriciaBosworth for smoking too much, leading Bosworth to recall their on-set con-versation: “‘I get nervous. I smoke too, you know,’ [Audrey] told me quietly.‘It doesn’t do any good.’”

Having spent a working lifetime surrounded by hair and makeup artistswho poked, dabbed, and painted her into big-screen perfection, she spentlittle time on her makeup at home—a clean, scrubbed face and a touch of lip-stick or eyeliner were all she needed or wanted. Spending a long time lookingat herself in the mirror was, she felt, nothing so much as a big bore.

Her dress: casual. Putting aside the Givenchy gowns she wore for the mostformal of occasions, Audrey found herself happiest when wearing tailoredslacks, Lacoste shirts, and loafers—comfort clothes. As recounted by docu-mentary filmmakers Joan Kramer and David Helley, Audrey, having happilyagreed to narrate their 1991 television documentary The Fred Astaire Song-book, pronounced herself thrilled when they asked her to dress casually forthe filming in slacks, shirt, and sweater. With no need for Givenchy, she

perched on a sofa, her feet tucked underneath, happy to be comfortable whiletalking about her legendary co-star.

A perfect evening at home? Cooking a simple supper and then curling upon the sofa to watch television.

Movies she liked:

Witness

Ferris Bueller’s Day Off

E.T.

The Princess Bride

Cyrano

The Mission

And—most surprisingly:

Prizzi’s Honor

Movies she didn’t like watching:

Anything violent, having seen enough real-life carnage in World War IIto last her a lifetime.

Regarding Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, she pulled no punches:“One of the most brutal, heartless things I’ve ever had to sit through.” Whichmakes it all the more ironic that Kubrick himself asked Audrey to star asEmpress Josephine in his long-planned film on the life of Napoleon. (A 2019British film exhibit about Kubrick’s exhaustive research and preparation forthe epic, never-filmed movie contained a gracious, handwritten note fromAudrey to “Mr. Kubrick” declining the role of Josephine.)

Her own films.

(Not one to spend much time contemplating her own screen legacy, whenpressed as to her favorite among her own movies, she sometimes allowed ashow she felt particularly proud of The Nun’s Story, while “the film that meantthe most to me emotionally was Roman Holiday.”)

Movies she longed for:

Romantic comedies. The world, she felt, was now a “darker, less secureplace . . . no longer very funny.”

Actresses she admired:

Meryl Streep

Julia Roberts

And surprisingly:

Cher: “Cher has an enormous scale of emotions and total lack of inhibi-tion, which I haven’t.”

Performances that elicited her highest admiration:

Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Bergman in the Ingmar Bergman masterpieceAutumn Sonata.

Not surprisingly, it was the role of the repressed daughter portrayed by LivUllmann that affected her most deeply.

Favorite television shows:

L.A. Law

Dynasty—Why? For the chuckles.

And while Audrey loved staying home with three-year-old Sean—in factnothing made her happier—she could still be tempted by a juicy film role.Which meant that when Jack Warner let it be known that he was very inter-ested in the idea of casting Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle in the film ver-sion of My Fair Lady, Audrey Hepburn let it be known that she was very in-terested in playing Eliza Doolittle.

The most famous postwar musical of them all. A brilliant score. And arole considered the personal property of Julie Andrews.

# Chapter Twenty-SevenMY FAIR LADY, 1963–1964

“And, finally, my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie and whomade all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner.”

—Julie Andrews accepting her Best Actress Academy Award for Mary Pop-pins

JUST HOW MUCH DID AUDREY HEPBURN want to play “Eliza Doolittle” in My FairLady? Consider her answer to a reporter when, just as Breakfast at Tiffany’sfinished shooting, he inquired as to what role she would like to play next.Quick as a shot the answer came back: “That’s easy to answer. I’d do any-thing to play Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady. There’s no other role I’m dyingto do; I just want to be Eliza.”

And after two years of back and forth, public debate, and will she or won’tshe, that ideal role came to pass. Audrey was ecstatic—but as Saint Teresa ofAvila once had it, “More tears are shed over answered prayers than un-answered ones.”

The most popular postwar Broadway musical of its era, 1956’s My FairLady had occasioned a furious bidding war for film rights, with the victoryultimately claimed by Warner Bros. to the tune of $\$ 5.5$ million (over $\$ 50$ mil-lion in today’s money). With that huge investment in mind, Jack Warner wasnot interested in hiring the then unknown-to-film Julie Andrews to recreateher acclaimed Broadway turn as Eliza. Never mind that the original cast al-bum had reigned as number one on the charts for months on end and that therole had landed Andrews on the then all-important cover of LIFE magazine.As far as Jack Warner was concerned, Julie Andrews was an unknown, andtherefore suspect, quantity.

According to one biographer, Jack Warner and Julie Andrews actually

talked about the film version of My Fair Lady on the phone, with Warnerasking her to screen-test for the role. Andrews’s reply: “Screen test? You’veseen me do the part. You know I can do a good job.” Warner shot back:“You’ve never made a movie and I’m investing a lot of money in this. I haveto be sure you photograph and project well. Films are a different medium.”Andrews refused the test. The ever-cost-conscious Warner was not evenswayed by Andrews’s extremely modest demand for a $\$ 75,000$ salary. JulieAndrews would not play Eliza.

Jack Warner, it turned out, had his eye on Audrey Hepburn. The Nun’sStory had been a huge success for Warner Bros., and Audrey was as big a starin Europe and Japan as in the United States. It was Audrey Hepburn, and notJulie Andrews, who represented the box office insurance Warner insistedupon.

And yet, even though Audrey coveted the role, she still thought Julie An-drews should be given a fair shake at recreating her signature role. To thatend, as reported in the family-approved The Audrey Hepburn Treasuresscrapbook: “She actually hosted a dinner party for some of the studio execut-ives in order to further convince them that Julie should be hired for the role.”

The answer? No dice. And when Audrey saw that Jack Warner would not,under any circumstances, sign Julie Andrews to play Eliza, and that he wasconsidering other actresses for the role, she let it be known, via agent KurtFrings, that she was interested in playing the role of Eliza Doolittle. Very in-terested: “If I turned it down they would offer it to another movie actress andI thought I was entitled to do it as much as the third girl, so then I did ac-cept.” Audrey may have received letters from people angry at her for “tak-ing” Julie Andrews’s role, but knowing that Julie was never going to beoffered the part, she very logically rationalized: “It was a plum role, the scriptwas terrific, and so I accepted the offer.” In later years, relates Sean, when Ju-lie Andrews and Blake Edwards would visit Audrey in Switzerland, Juliewould joke: “Thank God I didn’t get that part, because instead I got the Oscarfor Mary Poppins and made The Sound of Music.”

A deal was struck in May of 1962: for six weeks of rehearsal and threeand a half months of filming, Audrey would receive a salary of $\$ 1$ million, asum equaled at that point only by Elizabeth Taylor (Cleopatra), MarlonBrando, and Sophia Loren. To mitigate the tax consequences, payment wouldbe spread out over seven years, with Audrey receiving $142,957.15 on July 1

of each year from 1963 through 1969. With additional bonuses, Audreywould end up earning some $\$ 1.1$ million. There were, however, other taxramifications still to be considered; with My Fair Lady being shot entirely onthe Warner Bros. lot, Audrey would be subject to the high United States taxrates, and as a result, explained Sean, Audrey sold her percentages back tothe studio for $\$ 1$ million.

In addition to her $\$ 1$ million fee, Warner Bros. would also pay all ofAudrey’s living expenses while in Hollywood, the cost of her travel to andfrom Switzerland, and the salary for her personal secretary. The choice ofcameraman, still photographer, hairdressers and makeup artists were hersalone, as was veto power over all of her costumes. Perhaps even more im-portant in Audrey’s view, the film would be shot in sequence, a rarity for anyproduction, but one Audrey felt crucial in order to help her fully developEliza’s transformation from cockney flower seller to grand lady. It all addedup to one incontrovertible fact: with every one of her wishes granted, AudreyHepburn had now arrived at the very top of the Hollywood pecking order.

Deal in place, one question dwarfed all others: Could Audrey handle thevocal demands of the role? The Lerner and Loewe score, which most ofAmerica knew from the wildly successful original cast recording, covered anenormous range of styles, from the humorous “Just You Wait” to the joy-filled “I Could Have Danced All Night,” all of it part of a unique musicalstructure: the principals do not ever share a love song, and the emotionalthrust of the love story is kept subterranean, emerging only at movie’s endwhen phonetics professor Henry Higgins grudgingly admits “I’ve Grown Ac-customed to Her Face.” Before filming began, a disappointed Julie Andrewswas quoted as saying that she felt Audrey would be “enormously successful”in the role but that she should be aware that “two of the songs [in particular],‘Just You Wait, ’Enry ’Iggins’ and ‘I Could Have Danced All Night’ are noteasy. [The former] requires a lot of power, [the latter] has a great range [ofnotes].”

Hinting at questions of vocal ability as they did, Andrews’s comments stillpaled in comparison to those running rampant in the press: the snubbing ofJulie Andrews was big news and the all-powerful columnists of the day nowweighed in, with Hedda Hopper vehemently castigating Warner for not giv-ing the role of Eliza to Julie. Columnists Earl Wilson and Leonard Lyonsstaked out opposing positions; according to Wilson, Audrey could and would

sing the score, but to Lyons, it was all but certain Audrey would not sing it.The volume of press about Audrey’s singing ability grew by the day.

Well aware of the vocal pitfalls to which Andrews had referred, Audreyfelt reassured by the knowledge that it was the legendary George Cukor whowould be directing the astronomically budgeted $\$ 17$ million film, then themost expensive musical of all time. Ironically, even with four previousAcademy Award nominations to his credit, Cukor had not been the firstchoice to direct the film. Instead, it was Vincente Minnelli, the renowned dir-ector of the classic movie musicals Gigi, The Bandwagon, and Meet Me in St.Louis, who had ranked as Jack Warner’s number-one choice.

Cukor, however, was less expensive than Minnelli, a big plus in the viewof the notoriously tightfisted Warner, and unlike Minnelli, Cukor did not in-sist upon the right of final cut. Minnelli had no peer when it came to colorand design, but it was Cukor, the famed “women’s director” (code for gay),who possessed a solid gold reputation when it came to eliciting award-win-ning performances. Cukor, who had hoped to direct Audrey’s Broadway pro-duction of Gigi before scheduling conflicts interfered, was coming off thedisastrous Sophia Loren vehicle Heller in Pink Tights (1960), as well as thedisappointing The Chapman Report (1962). He needed a hit, wanted the MyFair Lady job, and was not going to make contractual demands to Warner.

Thrilled to finally be working with Audrey, he gladly accepted Warner’soffer of $\$ 300,000$ for fifty-two weeks of work. Cukor and Audrey quicklystruck up a great friendship, and ever loyal to his new star, after watchingMary Poppins, he privately weighed in: “I am not mean spirited or enviousbut me no like.” He found Poppins to be without any notable style, andopined that although Andrews sang nicely, he found her “earthbound andprim.”

Who best to star opposite Audrey as the Svengali-like phonetics professorHenry Higgins? Rex Harrison, twenty-one years older than Audrey, and theoriginal star of the Broadway production, was a known quantity on film evenif not a box office star of the first rank, but while he may have appeared to bethe logical choice, Jack Warner had other ideas and offered the part to CaryGrant. Warner considered Grant a much better box office bet than Harrison,but Grant immediately declined the role. After stating that he felt his friendAudrey was an inspired choice for the role of Eliza, Grant added that the partof Higgins belonged to Rex Harrison. In fact, not only did he refuse the part,

but, he added, he also would not even see the film unless Rex Harrisonplayed Higgins.

Peter O’Toole was then seriously considered for the role, and Cukor evenvisited him on the set of Lawrence of Arabia to discuss the possibility. Soserious were the discussions that Cukor wrote Jack Warner’s aide SteveTrilling on September 24, 1962: “I hope O’Toole was liked—I think he is ourman.” But just as happened with Vincente Minnelli, O’Toole’s agent askedfor too much money, and the idea of casting the Irish actor was dropped.(O’Toole did eventually play Henry Higgins in a 1987 Broadway revival ofPygmalion opposite Amanda Plummer.)

Asked to screen-test for the role, Harrison declined, and instead, at thesuggestion of his wife Rachel Roberts, cheekily sent Cukor two nude photos,one with a conveniently placed Chianti bottle in front of his torso, and theother featuring a strategically displayed copy of the New Statesman. It was alldesigned to show that he was still more than capable of playing the role, andeither the pictures or common sense on Warner’s part did the trick, becausethe part was Harrison’s—for a salary of $\$ 250,000$ and a promise from Cukorto return the photographs.

Harrison immediately began exercising his star prerogatives, shipping hisown Rolls-Royce from London to New York, where it was picked up anddriven cross-country. In Harrison’s grand reasoning: “When I flew into LosAngeles I was met at the airport by my own car.”

Such demands were not out of character for Harrison, and in an amusingaside about the film’s casting, the often-acerbic André Previn reported thatRex didn’t care if Eliza was played by Julie or Audrey because in Harrison’sopinion, “Nobody was interested in the girl. They were only interested inhim.”

Even in his autobiography, the best Harrison could manage about histhree-year onstage relationship with Julie Andrews was to state: “In the threeyears we played together we never had a cross word of any kind,” addingonly, “we had had an extremely good working relationship, leading separateprivate lives and meeting only onstage.” As to the differences between histwo Eliza Doolittles, Harrison opined: “I think there’s a lot of steel in [Julie],more steel than in Audrey.”

Harrison was right about his two Elizas: both women exuded charm, bothwere consummate professionals, and both treated their co-workers with un-

failing respect. The difference lay in their affect. Julie Andrews’s genuineniceness was tempered by the wariness anyone would have acquired after achildhood spent working in vaudeville, and she remained friendly, polite—and guarded. Audrey, for all her veneer of sophistication, remained strikinglyvulnerable, self-effacing, and eager to please. Having interviewed both wo-men in the 1980s for his authorized biography of Cecil Beaton, Hugo Vickerssmartly described the difference in his telephone calls with the two Elizas:“The difference between talking to [Julie] and talking to Audrey Hepburnwas that I felt this one was sitting bolt upright or even standing, while Audreywould have been lying with her feet up. Julie Andrews was more factual andprecise, Audrey Hepburn more dreamy.” It was, in effect, the differencebetween a charming nanny and a wistful gamine.

Harrison’s extraordinary ego was made clear in his exasperated statementabout the musicians with whom he’d be working: “Why the musicians willhave to follow me. They are my servants.” Wrote Cecil Beaton to a friend:“Audrey is just as marvellous as he [Rex] is awful!” By now Beaton andAudrey had formed a genuine friendship, one which had begun tentatively atthe time of Broadway’s Gigi, when the worldly Beaton had photographed thenervous new star at the behest of Diana Vreeland. The two aesthetes had in-stantly hit it off, and Audrey took to calling him whenever she found herselfin London. Speaking years after Beaton died, Audrey made it clear that herlove for Beaton had not diminished: “My feeling about Cecil—I really didlove him. I’m not gushing when I say that. I really adored him because hewas very tender with me . . .”

Love Audrey he did, but Beaton disdained Harrison, a feeling shared byMona Washbourne, who was cast in the film as Higgins’s housekeeper Mrs.Pearce. Wrote Hugo Vickers of his encounter with Washbourne: “She lovedAudrey Hepburn, and she said that someone rang to ask her about Rex Har-rison. He asked, ‘Is there something nice you could say about him?’ ‘No,’ shereplied.”

Small wonder then that Harrison stated: “Filming My Fair Lady was not atall a piece of cake.”

At the early stages of preproduction, however, Audrey remained thrilledwith everything about My Fair Lady, and on April 6, 1963, she wrote toCukor after receiving the script. On pale blue stationery embossed with asmall crest in the upper lefthand corner, she enthused at length: “As I was just

off for a few days in Madrid with Mel, I took it with me and read it one after-noon, resting in bed. There are not words! It’s MARVELLOUS, I am beyondmyself with happiness and excitement!”

Careful to defer to Cukor and Beaton, she nonetheless gently suggestedthat the musical numbers be staged by Gene Loring, who had choreographedher “Basal Metabolism” “beatnik” dance in Funny Face: “The reason I dareto even make the suggestion is that I know him and you. You would like him.He is totally without the kind of ‘ego’ that would make him insist on his wayif you know what I mean. . . . I do think he can do any kind of style requiredand you would find him wonderfully easy to work with.” Even Audrey’s gen-teel power had limits, however, and the choreography was ultimately entrus-ted to Fred Astaire’s righthand man, Hermes Pan.

Aware that her not inconsiderable task was to suggest a cockney flowerseller while still rendering the words understandable, Audrey began studyingcockney dialect with Peter Ladefoged, a professor of phonetics at the Univer-sity of Southern California. Said Audrey months later: “I worked on the ac-cent, worked on the lines. In the beginning the cockney was too thick andpeople on the set couldn’t understand it. If you speak cockney fast, it’s veryhard for non-cockney ears.” (The very title My Fair Lady, after all, comesfrom the cockney pronunciation of Mayfair Lady.)

Amid all this activity, the elephant in the room grew larger by the day:Would Audrey really be allowed to sing all of her songs? This had been thesubject of much discussion even before she arrived in California for prepro-duction, and in his diary entry of May 16, 1963, two days before Audrey flewin from Switzerland, Cecil Beaton noted that “after lunch, we accompaniedhim [Alan Jay Lerner] to listen to a girl singing Eliza’s songs, in caseAudrey’s voice proves to be too frail for one or two of the more operaticarias, and a few notes have to be dubbed.” Audrey’s contract gave the studiothe right to substitute another singing voice for hers if they felt it necessary,but since she fully intended to do all her own singing, she began six weeks ofvocal training in the summer of 1963 with Sue Seaton and pianist HarperMacKay, while simultaneously working with Hermes Pan and musical super-visor André Previn.

That “girl singing Eliza’s songs” was actress/singer Marni Nixon, who hadalready dubbed the singing voices of Deborah Kerr in The King and I andNatalie Wood in West Side Story. Her audition, held in Beaton’s bungalow on

the Warner Bros. lot, was attended by George Cukor, production designerGene Allen, and Harper MacKay (with whom Nixon had worked on TheKing and I). Surprisingly absent was Nixon’s friend André Previn. RemarkedPrevin in later years: “Marni had this peculiar, chameleonlike quality: Shecould ‘do’ everybody. You would hand her a piece of music and say, the firstfour bars are cockney, then it gets French. It made no difference; she coulddo it.”

Marni Nixon wanted this job—if, in fact, it turned into a job. Not havingheard a word after her audition, she called the New York offices of WarnerBros. to inform them that she was in town and glad to audition once again.For her efforts, she was rather condescendingly turned down: “We can’t haveany native ‘Californian’ to do this dubbing.” Aware that André Previn wasgreatly displeased he had not even been told about her test, she was not sur-prised to soon receive a call from Warner Bros. asking her to come in and au-dition again. This audition took place not in Cukor’s bungalow but in a darksound booth, where she could not see any of those listening.

After the audition went off without a hitch, she was still uncertain as towhether the job was hers. Cukor and Previn remained undecided as well, atwhich point Jack Warner called the film’s post production supervisor RudiFehr. In Nixon’s retelling, it was Fehr who emphatically told Warner: “Theonly one who can do this part is Marni Nixon.” Replied Warner: “Fine, it’sdone! Hire her!”

Even with Nixon on tap, at this stage it still remained unclear just howmuch of the score would be sung by Audrey and how much supplied byNixon. In fact, on the day of Audrey’s arrival in Los Angeles, Cukor, Lerner,and Beaton paid Audrey a visit at her rented house, and while tea was beingdispensed, Audrey queried lyricist Alan J. Lerner if hers would be the voiceheard singing the entire score; she then asked the same question of CecilBeaton, and, most notably, of Cukor himself. The director gave his reply:Yes, Audrey’s voice would be used, but it might well be mixed with anothervoice for the higher notes, an approach that had worked very well with LeslieCaron’s vocals in Gigi. Replied Audrey: “I’ll understand if you do, but in anycase, I’ll work hard on my voice, have as many lessons as you like. It’s allpart of the business, to learn to sing and dance.” Noted Beaton in his diaryentry for June 27, seven weeks before the start of filming: “Having workedon it like a Trojan ever since her arrival, her voice has improved to such an

extent that she will be singing most of Eliza’s songs.”

It soon became clear, however, that Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lernerdid not feel that Audrey’s pleasant but thin singing voice could handle theirdemanding score, particularly on the soaring final notes of “I Could HaveDanced All Night.” André Previn granted an after-the-fact window into thecomposers’ decision-making process, pointing out that even if Audrey wasnot the greatest singer in the world, “it wasn’t such a crime. But you can ima-gine how Lerner and Loewe felt. . . . This was their statement for the ages.”In fact, Lerner, who doubled as the film’s screenwriter as well as lyricist, isone of the few to ever criticize Audrey’s professionalism, in later yearstelling Hugo Vickers that his original idea for Eliza’s entrance was for a cartpiled high with vegetables and flowers to crash through a big puddle anddrench Eliza. In Lerner’s telling, Audrey refused the entrance, claiming thather fans would not like it, leading Lerner to deem her attitude “unprofes-sional.”

What made the My Fair Lady musical experience unique and daunting forboth Audrey and Marni was that even with a final decision not yet made,Nixon was actually present while Audrey sang for Sue Seaton, the better tolearn Audrey’s speech patterns and breathing techniques. Explained Nixon:“The most crucial criterion was for the basic timbre of the voice to not onlymatch Audrey Hepburn’s, but also be flexible enough to complement her act-ing style. . . It was a matter of my singing the songs with her accent, and thenher imitating me. She had to have a lot of trust in me. The thrill I have is thatI was able to pick up on Audrey and her style. I really felt fused with her.”The work required a microscopic attention to detail: “Audrey seemed to havea lower, wider-shaped hard palate than mine, which was narrower and higherin shape. These anatomic differences can affect the high partials in the reson-ance and the overtones in any voice.”

During these joint rehearsals, whatever Audrey’s private feelings, shegave no indication of any discomfort with Nixon’s presence, going so far asto pick Nixon up each morning en route to the studio. Related Marni: “Whohad ever heard of such a thing? Audrey Hepburn had! . . . She was absolutelycharming and real, but you still had the sense of her being very aristocratic.When she spoke, it was with carefully chosen words.”

As their daily rides together increased in number, their talks became morepersonal, touching upon husbands, marriage, and children. A sense of trust

was developing, which ultimately informed Nixon’s work: “The more I knowa person the more chameleonlike I can be and the better I can serve the char-acter being created.”

With the question of dubbing still undecided, both Audrey and Nixon con-tinued to rehearse Eliza’s songs. For “Just You Wait” Audrey would beginthe song, with Marni taking over in the midsection before Audrey’s voice re-turned for the final stanza in which Eliza joyfully imagines Higgins’s demise.For “The Rain in Spain,” Audrey now spoke the introductory lines beforeMarni chimed in. Both women recorded vocal tracks, with Marni “trying tosing it as I thought she would have, and then she would correct my pronunci-ation. It was really a technical thing. She had to have a lot of trust in me.”

Singing rehearsals were held on the Warner’s soundstage in front ofCukor, Beaton, Hermes Pan, Previn, and dialect coach Peter Ladefoged (inNixon’s humorous recall, Audrey referred to Ladefoged as: “An Americanwho probably knows London like I know Peking”). As the hybrid rehearsalscontinued, Nixon would often begin to sing one of the songs, only to bestopped by Cukor, who wanted to coach Audrey as to what Eliza was think-ing at this point in the story. Direction completed, Nixon would begin to singagain, this time incorporating all the instructions Cukor had given Audrey.

Added into the mix was the question of the proper cockney accent to beused in the earliest songs, specifically “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly” and “JustYou Wait.” According to Nixon, Audrey insisted upon waiting for the arrivalof Stanley Holloway, cast as Eliza’s incorrigible father, so that she could im-itate the cockney accent he would be using. The score, however, needed to berecorded before his arrival, leading Nixon to state, “Ultimately Audrey [andI] listened carefully to all the opinions, then it seemed to me she just did it herown way.”

Recording sessions began on July 4, 1963, at Goldwyn Studios. Ever theperfectionist, Audrey worked tirelessly on her singing, and after each record-ing, pleaded to rerecord the song. Observed Nixon: “She felt that now thatshe heard how it should be done, she could actually do it.” To Cecil Beaton,the recording session proved “an ordeal” for Audrey, but she worked her waythrough “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly,” and when actual filming began, lip-synced to her own vocal of the song.

While Audrey prerecorded the score in the studio, Harrison insisted uponperforming his numbers live on set via a shortwave radio microphone placed

under his tie. The problem with this early prototype lay in the fact that it keptpicking up audio traffic being broadcast on the same wavelength, including,most memorably, a talk by the mayor of Miami.

With Harrison’s audio problems corrected, filming began on schedule.While Harrison concentrated on adjusting his performance for the all-seeingeye of the camera, Audrey worked at deepening her characterization. Of thefilm’s very first scene, in which a bedraggled Eliza attempts to sell flowers,Beaton noted: “[Audrey] didn’t get into the right groove; had been toostrident, her eyes bugged, and she hadn’t felt deeply enough. Audrey realizedher own mistake, commenting ‘Unless you know a character so well that youcan relax completely, it somehow doesn’t work. I see what it should be nowthat it’s too late. . . .’” Fortunately for all involved, the scene was later reshot.

My Fair Lady was deemed a closed set, and each one of the six soundstages utilized for filming sported signs stating, “Positively no visitors.” Con-sumed with preparation for the marathon role, Audrey hung a sign on thewhite picket fence erected around her dressing room: “Positively Do Not Dis-turb.” The only people allowed onto the Warners soundstages while Audreywas working were Mel Ferrer, Doris Brynner, and Hubert de Givenchy.Givenchy did not contribute any costumes—My Fair Lady had been Beaton’sexclusive property since its theatrical premiere in 1956—but as Audrey’strusted confidante, he was a welcome presence for the highly stressed star.She was, as always, pleasant to all involved with the film, but between scenesshe studied her script and people did not speak to her. So tense was Audreythat she decreed she did not want anyone in her “eyeline range” during film-ing, claiming it threw her “off balance.” To keep his star happy, Cukor set upbaffles with peepholes, just as he had done when directing Greta Garbo inCamille (1936).

The pressure Audrey felt resulted not only from the issue of whether hersinging would be dubbed but also from the scope of such a massive undertak-ing. In the costume department alone, ninety-three full-time assistants laboredto help create over 1,000 costumes, at a total cost of $500,000. Executing thedesigns of the gifted, often difficult Cecil Beaton, these assistants stitched to-gether Edwardian-style gowns for the women and suits and top hats for themen, the nearly 1,100 costumes complimented by an extraordinary array oflong-out-of-style hats and caps.

Audrey loved Beaton’s designs and paid tribute to his talent in an inter-

view with a reporter from Vogue magazine: “He makes you look the way youhave always wanted to look . . . I adore the hats; they seem to be always inmotion . . . the dress becomes a stem to the hat.” Their relationship grew intoone of total and mutual admiration; Audrey felt that Beaton understood herpersonally as well as professionally, and Beaton always did comprehend thejoyful/sad dichotomy in her personality. Even without mascara and shadow,he noted, her eyes “are like those in a Flemish painting and are even more ap-pealing—young and sad.”

With her typical modesty, Audrey explained to Hugo Vickers: “I really ad-ored him because he was always very tender with me, very sweet to me.There’s nothing terribly unusual about me, but perhaps there was a sensitivityabout him, and I think he understood me. . . . If somebody loves you verymuch then they make you feel beautiful and he did it with his tenderness, butalso with his art.” Beaton, whose waspish imperiousness could intimidate andwound, let down his guard with Audrey, responding to such an extent that, asVickers relayed to Audrey, in the designer’s diaries “every time he mentionedyou—I don’t know if he published it—he describes you as an ‘angel of good-ness.’” Responded Audrey: “We did understand each other. And I loved himvery much. That he understood.”

Beaton, who was to work happily with Barbra Streisand on 1970’s On aClear Day You Can See Forever, incisively described Audrey’s approach tostardom, especially in contrast to Streisand’s. There were, he felt, two typesof superstars—“The coolly detached and the fanatically involved.” Audrey,he felt, embodied the first and Streisand the second. In both My Fair Ladyand On a Clear Day, the two stars portrayed characters who morphed frombedraggled urchins to regal ladies, and he took pleasure in designing accord-ingly: “Both women were marvelous at conveying this earthiness and seemedto relish the chance to wear rags and carry on like craven guttersnipes. But asgrand ladies, dressed to the hilt, they were truly in their element, aware thateverything had been building up to that moment—neither had a lack of con-fidence in their ability to act regal and look monumental, despite their widelyvarying types and images.”

Ever the clotheshorse, Audrey fell in love with the gowns Beaton had de-signed for the film, and realizing that Eliza spent half the movie costumed asa bedraggled flower girl, she asked to try on some of the gowns created forthe extras. Knowing a potential publicity bonanza when he saw it, Jack

Warner granted permission for Beaton to spend two days taking still photos,and Audrey happily spent June 5 and 6, 1963, trying on dozens of differentdresses. Beaton took upwards of one thousand photos, and as detailed by thedesigner in his diary, “the combination of Audrey and these exaggeratedclothes created comic magic. She wanted to pose for photographs in everyone of them. ‘I don’t want to play Eliza! She doesn’t have enough prettyclothes. I want to parade in all these.’ And she did: they will never look sowell on anybody else.” (So beautifully did Audrey play to the lenses ofdozens of still photographers that it is no great surprise to learn that a roughestimate finds her having spent a combined total of two years of her lifeshooting some 650 magazine covers.)

Julie Andrews may still be associated with the role of Eliza because of herspectacular singing, but even she never inhabited the newly respectable “MissEliza Doolittle” of the embassy ball quite so thoroughly as did Audrey, forthe simple reason that she never exuded the love of finery that emanated fromAudrey. Andrews dutifully wore the beautiful society clothes, and with hergreat figure looked the part, but whether in My Fair Lady, Camelot, or Thor-oughly Modern Millie, one always had a sense that as a thorough professionalshe would certainly parade in the clothes but deep down longed to take offthe fancy hats and briskly clap her hands for everyone to return to the busi-ness at hand. Coolly efficient she was, which made her ideal to play a gov-erness or two.

Wanting to give Beaton a present for allowing her to play dress-up,Audrey did not buy him an expensive Beverly Hills bibelot but instead giftedhim with a more personal present: roses flown in from her own garden. In-scribing a photo to Beaton, she wrote: “Dearest C.B.: Ever since I can re-member I have always so badly wanted to be beautiful. Looking at those pho-tographs last night I saw that, for a short time at least, I am, all because ofyou.” Drawing a heart, she signed the note “Audrey.”

Audrey’s son Sean, in fact, gives great credit to Beaton for the success ofthe film: “He created the look of the film with his production design, de-signed all the clothes, and as part of his duties took those amazing black-and-white photographs of my mother in all the incredible clothes. For meBeaton’s photographs—not just of my mother but all of his work—are theentertainment industry equivalent of Ansel Adams’s photographs of El Cap-itan. He also wrote extraordinary articles—he was like a modern-day Le-

onardo.”

Audrey and Beaton may have formed a deep and lasting friendship, butBeaton and Cukor certainly did not. Both men were talented, highly opinion-ated, creative, and gay, each accustomed to always having his own way;working in such close proximity for months on end inevitably made for aclash of egos, with Cukor not wanting Beaton to bother Audrey with portraitsittings, while Beaton felt his contribution was being undervalued. Wrote thedesigner of the women cast as extras: “The glittering capes were for tall wo-men who should have looked like birds of paradise. Here was a dreary gangof runts. They might have been dressed from any old, tarnished rag-bag.”

On July 17, two months into filming, tempers boiled over, with Max Ber-cutt, the director of publicity, informing Beaton: “Mr. Cukor doesn’t wantyou to take pictures of Audrey while they are fixing the lights. . . . Mr. Cukordoes not want you to photograph her on the set during any of her workingdays.” Wrote Beaton in his diary: “I was later told that it took George Cukortwo hours to recover from his displeasure with me enough to continue.”

Although Audrey remained oblivious to the conflict—“it was something Iwas not aware of during the picture”—ten days later relations between thetwo men had disintegrated to the point where Beaton further confided: “Ihave begun to feel like a trespasser on the sets that I have designed.” In real-ity, however, while Beaton received credit for the film’s production design,only the costumes were completely his; the true production design creditproperly belonged to the veteran Gene Allen, who ultimately received billingas co-production designer for having done the lion’s share of the work.

On November 22, his final day on the film, Beaton managed to say good-bye to Cukor, but the two men never spent another day working together.Still, Beaton had managed to remain the only still photographer allowed onset, with a tense Audrey explaining to her friend Bob Willoughby that whilethe movie camera did not disturb her, the smaller lens of a still camera simplydistracted her too much for anyone other than Beaton to be present.

Cukor drove Audrey without let-up—in the blunt words of Willoughby,“He was unrelenting.” Audrey grew exhausted, and after three months ofshooting, the pressures grew crushing; in one weekend alone, she revealed toBeaton, her son Sean had been sick with a temperature of 103 degrees, hercanary had flown away, and her diamond wedding ring had been stolen fromher mobile dressing room. The necessity of getting up at 5:30 a.m. for six

months in a row had left her worn out, and Beaton felt that if shooting wereto continue “three days longer than she is geared for, total collapse would beinevitable.”

And yet, even though Cukor drove Audrey mercilessly, the two remainedstaunch friends, and for years after, Audrey would often stay at his homewhen in Hollywood. Their close relationship was to continue until his deathin 1983, and in a letter he wrote her on February 25, 1965, six weeks beforethat year’s controversial Academy Awards, he gushed: “Dearest, dearestAudrey, you’re lovely, talented, intelligent, distinguished, capable only ofbeautiful behavior. You’re possessed of all the graces and virtues includingthe rarest of all—simple kindness and plain goodness.” In a humorous endingto the letter, he added: “I hope all this praise doesn’t make you become insuf-ferable.”

As the months of filming continued, Audrey remained under the illusionthat all of her own vocals might be used, with just an occasional interpolatedhigh note from Marni Nixon. But now, with a final decision made, Cukor hadto inform Audrey, in the midst of a day’s shooting, that Nixon would be dub-bing her songs. Audrey let out a startled “Oh!” and for the first and last timein her career left the set during the day’s shooting. Returning the next day,she apologized for what she termed her “wicked” behavior. There were nohistrionics, simply a muttered “oh” that nonetheless conveyed a world of dis-appointment. Such was diva-dom, Audrey Hepburn style.

What actually bothered Audrey most about the dubbing fiasco was that instringing her along and allowing her to believe she would be heard on themajority of the songs, the filmmakers had not been honest: “I felt used. And Iwas angry. I was really angry. But I didn’t show it outright. I just kept it in-side. . . .” Her anger, in fact, had proved justified, a fact underscored byMarni Nixon: “Rudi Fehr, who was with Warner all the time, has said thatthey just let her record her tracks to placate her. They never had any seriousintention of using her voice. Never.”

In André Previn’s blunt analysis: “Marni blabbed all over town that shewas going to more or less ‘save’ the movie,” but in the end, although Nixonreceived royalties from the successful soundtrack, she did not receive anyscreen credit. A talented and warm woman, she would go on to play Elizaherself in a May 1964 New York City Center revival of My Fair Lady, re-ceiving special coaching for the role from Julie Andrews when the two were

filming The Sound of Music. Said Nixon about playing the role: “Having toreally play the whole role (as opposed to just singing it) made me respectAudrey Hepburn even more—if that was possible—than I had before.”

Speaking about the dubbing controversy in 2003, Marni allowed as howshe “felt bad for Audrey: she could tell that she wasn’t quite getting it.” Inher telling, when she ran into Audrey’s son Sean shortly after Audrey’sdeath, “He told me that his mother admired me and every day she wouldcome home from the studio and say how talented I was.” It’s a nice story butsomewhat undercut by the fact that at the time My Fair Lady was filmed,Sean was four years old, and likely not conversant with the intricacies of filmdubbing.

In truth, Audrey could have handled songs like “Loverly,” “The Rain inSpain,” and “Show Me,” and the DVD for the film’s beautiful $600,000 res-toration in 1994 included bonus tracks of Audrey’s own vocals on “Wouldn’tIt Be Loverly” and “Show Me.” Everyone can now be the judge, and “Lov-erly” in fact sounds, well, just that; Audrey’s small true voice hits all thenotes while conveying the song’s meaning—she is at home vocally becausethe song is not a big belting number along the lines of “I Could Have DancedAll Night.”

Says Sean: “I used to think that My Fair Lady had aged as a film but withtime I’ve come to reverse my feelings. It’s such a beautifully structured mu-sical—maybe the greatest ever. I hate the fact that they dubbed my mother.You can hear how good she sounds on the restoration extras. I hear two smallplaces where she sounds slightly offkey but if it were today, they could havelet her sing and then gone back after the recording was completed and fixed itvia ADR. I think her singing is great.”

Audrey’s singing is, in fact, charming and true to character, but these sametracks reveal that the high notes, the real money notes at the end of “I CouldHave Danced All Night” would have been beyond her reach; she simply didnot have the vocal range to soar up to the final burst of enthusiasm exclaim-ing “I could have danced, danced, danced—all night!” Those are the notesthat provide the audience with an emotional catharsis to match Eliza’s, andthe powerful belt necessary to push the drama spinning forward would haveeluded her.

Still, it’s likely that only those elusive high notes need have been dubbed,and with Audrey’s own voice utilized, the film would have gained in levels

of authenticity. Instead, the powers that be decided that Audrey’s ownsinging would be heard only in snippets: a fair amount of “Just You Wait” aswell as scattered phrases in “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly” and “Show Me” util-ized Audrey’s vocals, but the total amounted to no more than ten percent ofEliza’s songs. Understandably enough, it remained a bit of a sore subject forAudrey, and in a 1991 interview on Larry King Live, when asked who haddone the singing for her, she surprisingly replied: “I’ve forgotten her name, alovely girl,” before adding, “I sang a bit of it Larry!”

As for the personal relationship between Audrey and Rex Harrison, it was,at least on Audrey’s part, entirely cordial and professional. It was known thatHarrison had not been particularly kind or effusive with Julie Andrews onBroadway, but with her impeccable manners, Andrews has never spoken illof Harrison. In the retelling of Roger Moore, however, Harrison “hated [An-drews] with a passion.” As it was, Harrison began shooting the film with anattitude toward Audrey that was “wary at first.” As biographer CharlesHigham has pointed out, however, when Audrey stated that she had knownKay Kendall (Harrison’s deceased wife) at the Marie Rambert ballet school,he soon grew friendlier, and genuinely appreciated Audrey’s gift of a red bi-cycle to ride around the studio lot.

In his autobiography, Harrison struck a tactful note about My Fair Lady,writing “Audrey is a very gentle and sweet person, and we get on very well.She was terribly thin, and in the habit of eating only raw vegetables, which Ialways thought could not give her enough energy.” In a second autobio-graphy, he added: “Audrey also had to weather a great deal of adverse presspublicity about how much she was being paid, for most of the press had sidedwith Julie . . . Audrey is a very sensitive person and could not fail to feel allthis.”

Harrison himself was, in fact, a brilliant performer, with a rapier-like abil-ity to elevate any drawing-room comedy or witty bit of dialogue. But as aperson? In the words of André Previn, although Harrison “gave one of themost transcendental performances ever, [he] was—and I don’t say this lightly—the most appalling human being I ever worked with. He was charming andfunny and a great raconteur, but Jesus Christ, what he did to people. Rexdidn’t like Audrey very much. He was mean about her, not to her. That wasvery much more his style.”

As to the dubbing controversy, Harrison appeared to mostly look upon it

as an inconvenience to himself: “[Audrey] had to be dubbed, and shemouthed the words while somebody else sang it, and I found it quite difficultto make the film with her like this, because I’d grown used to Julie singingher numbers at me every night on stage for three whole years.” Referring toJulie having won the Oscar for Mary Poppins, Harrison pronounced himselfdelighted before adding: “The only thing I was not delighted with was that[Julie] didn’t do the film with me, and that was only partly because it wouldhave been much easier for me if she had.”

In Previn’s amusing analysis, Rex’s “outward self-assurance was only acover-up for an even greater self-assurance underneath. There seemed to beonly two ways to approach any problem: his way and the wrong way. . . .”During the course of filming, it was Previn who grew ever fonder of Audrey,admitting to feeling awestruck by her beauty, and on one occasion stared ather until she said: “‘What’s the matter, what are you looking at?’” Previn’sreply: “‘Audrey you’re just so beautiful I can’t stand it.’ She giggled and tookmy hand and said, ‘Come to dinner.’ I said, ‘Okay.’ It was wonderfullydone.”

What became clear as filming progressed was that Audrey appeared moreat home as Miss Doolittle, the genteel lady, than as Eliza, the bedraggled gut-tersnipe of a flower girl. Even so, if her own natural elegance could not helpbut peep through at times, it was not for lack of trying to appear disheveled;her hair was curled every day in order to make it look frizzy, then coated withVaseline to make it appear matted. The entire transformation was then toppedoff by the application of dirt on her face and Fuller’s Earth on her unflatter-ing, multilayered grimy clothing. Said Geoff Allan, the film’s expert at agingclothes: “I gave Audrey’s coat seven different dyeings to make it look as oldas that.” (Muttered Stanley Holloway to Cecil Beaton: “It is remarkable thatthis scraggy little girl has a green face and then on the screen looks like a mil-lion dollars.”) So dirty was Audrey after all of these “preparations” that shedid not even want Mel to visit her on set while she was wearing such filthyclothes. She did, however, find one way around the dirt by spraying herselfwith Joy, a very exclusive and expensive perfume: “I may look dirty,’ she’dsay, ‘But I’m going to smell pretty.’”

Whatever the uneasiness about Audrey’s believability as a raggedy flowergirl, there was none about her transformation into an elegant lady. When,after a triumphant celebration of her linguistic mastery on “The Rain in

Spain,” she blossoms into a refined, beautifully dressed young woman, shepositively soars. Her own physical characteristics, the ramrod straight balletposture, model’s figure, and graceful walk, all expertly conveyed Eliza’stransformation into a “tower of strength” without a word being spoken. Thisnewly minted lady of impeccable bearing appears aristocratic to the bone, andthe memory of her flower-selling days remains present only in the open-hearted tenderness of her gaze.

Overshadowing every other aspect of this transformation was the audi-ence’s first glimpse of Eliza as she departs for the embassy ball. In one of themost iconic moments in film history, Audrey silently appears at the top of thestairs in a beautiful Empire-style antique white gown. Discovered in a shopby Beaton, the dress was, in his words, “quite as beautiful as snow and ice ontrees in Switzerland.” With her hair piled high and a diamond tiara in themiddle of the upsweep, Audrey’s ultra-glamorous look, completed by whiteopera gloves and a glittering diamond necklace, is so startling that for all in-volved, the only conceivable reaction was one of total capitulation. Which isprecisely why the jaded My Fair Lady film crew broke into applause upontheir first glimpse of this vision: “When she entered the set for the first timein it, she looked so beautiful the crew and the rest of the cast stood silentlygazing at her, then broke out with applause and cheers.” It’s a show-stoppingmoment and yet Audrey immediately gave full credit for the effect to CecilBeaton: “In that absolutely sublime dress, with my hair dressed to kill, anddiamonds everywhere, I felt super!” In typically modest fashion she furtheranalyzed: “All I had to do was walk down the stairs. How could I miss?”

Standing regally in the Higgins home, a mixture of pride and hesitationflitting across her face as she determinedly waits for Higgins to offer his arm,Audrey represents nothing less than the quintessence of Hollywood stardom.In the words of Cecil Beaton: “The little princess of Roman Holiday hadgrown into a queen’s estate.”

After all the Sturm und Drang of the dubbing controversy, the shooting ofthe film, tightly controlled by George Cukor, proceeded in relatively smoothfashion. There was, however, one big jolt which occurred six weeks intofilming, when President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Itwas Audrey who relayed the news to the entire cast and crew, and after herannouncement, shooting was canceled for the rest of the day. Filming soonresumed, continuing on its relatively obstacle-free path until the final shots

were captured right before Christmas. Postproduction began in January 1964,with a release date of October 21, 1964, locked in.

Critical reaction to the final cut of two hours and fifty minutes provedhighly favorable, with Bosley Crowther of the New York Times leading theapplause: “They’ve made a superlative film from the musical stage show MyFair Lady. . . . The happiest single thing about it is that Audrey Hepburn su-perbly justifies the decision of the producer Jack L. Warner to get her to playthe title role that Julie Andrews so charmingly and popularly originated onthe stage.” In the New York Journal American, the response proved evenmore emphatic: “Audrey Hepburn is an enchanting Eliza Doolittle.”

In the end, the veteran Cukor does makes My Fair Lady work; it may notbe sensational and it’s not original, but it is thoroughly professional, expans-ively produced, and if not always transporting, highly enjoyable. The flawsremain mostly a result of a failure to fully mask the theatrical origins of thepiece. The deliberately stylized Ascot sequences prove jarring in their affect,and while Beaton’s costumes are, indeed, showstoppers; in an odd way theyprove to be asset and detriment at the very same time. They are so beautifulin form and detail that the viewer’s eye is captured and pleased, yet they al-most literally stop the show. Especially in the Ascot scene, it’s almost as ifCecil Beaton is pushing Cukor aside to say: “Stop the horses! I’m bringingout my costumes.” They’re beautiful in the extreme, but as Jeanine Basingerhas pointed out, the viewer may also want to ask: “That’s all very nice—butcan we please get back to the story?”

The lack of movement in so many musical sequences proves more notice-able on screen than it ever did on stage, but the story still delivers, and the cu-mulative effect remains surprisingly powerful. While the role of a bedraggledcockney flower seller is not a natural fit for Audrey, Cukor skillfully worksaround this by repeatedly cutting to Rex Harrison for his horrified reactionsto Eliza’s caterwauling. More to the point, as sensitively directed by Cukorand photographed in loving close-up by Hollywood legend Harry Stradling,Audrey is still able to gamely strut through the first half of the film. Far frombeing the ersatz cockney of legend, she is often quite touching as the desper-ate-for-a-better-life Eliza.

It is, of course, after Eliza’s transformation into a couture-wearing elegantlady that Audrey’s performance fully takes off, but it’s not just that the meta-morphosis grants Audrey a chance to wear beautiful clothes and talk like a

member of the aristocracy. It’s that she is superb at conveying Eliza’s emo-tional devastation at being cast aside after her triumph at the ball. If everyperson, male and female alike, continually tries to answer the age-old ques-tion of “Where do I fit in?” then where does the ladylike Eliza now belong inlife? In her own words, “What’s to become of me?” That overwhelming feel-ing of abandonment, one which Audrey had experienced in her own life, un-derscored her portrayal of an Eliza whose despair registers with a surprisingemotional wallop.

Eliza was now caught between two worlds while belonging to neither, asense of displacement that coursed through many of Audrey’s films all theway back to Roman Holiday and Sabrina. When Sabrina’s own father says ofher: “She doesn’t belong in a mansion, but then again she doesn’t belong inthe garage either,” it established the motif that ran with great impact not onlythroughout Audrey’s filmography, but also in her personal life. Where in factdid the young Audrey Hepburn fit in after her father disappeared from herlife? Who, she continually asked both onscreen and off, would love her?

George Cukor knew how to frame and underscore this essential and ap-pealing quality of Audrey’s in order to make an audience care about Eliza’sfate, just as he knew how to help Rex Harrison adjust and tamp down hisstage performance for the different demands of the screen. Given how miso-gynistic and unpleasant Professor Higgins can be, one can never be sure howmuch the audience cares about his fate, which means that if the audience isnot invested in Eliza’s journey, My Fair Lady remains an object of audienceindifference. But Audrey here lifts the film above the level of a mere stageadaptation, giving the film its heart and elevating the entire sweep of eventsabove the somewhat stagey first half until the viewer is emotionally investedin Eliza’s fate.

In many ways, the interplay between Eliza’s fate and Audrey’s own vul-nerable personality infuses the entire film. The genuine tenderness Audreydisplays throughout is rare to behold in any movie star because it’s not putupon—it’s raw. Any open-hearted sensitivity with which a star may have be-gun her ascent in golden age Hollywood often started to fracture beneath thesometimes crushing demands of stardom, but in rare cases, the vulnerabilityremained and could be displayed to sometimes hypnotic effect. Such provedto be the case with Marilyn Monroe, but her fragility often seemed on theverge of collapsing under the weight of her own desperation. Watching Mar-

ilyn, particularly at the end of her career, became not just poignant but some-times uncomfortable, because no one seemed able to save her. In the case ofAudrey Hepburn, however, the fragility was leavened by an audience’s sensethat she, like Eliza, would persevere and triumph, no matter how desperatethe circumstances.

That mix of the professional persona with the intimately personal is pre-cisely why, in the words of Bosley Crowther, Audrey’s Eliza proved “almostunbearably poignant in the later scenes when she hungers for love.” In theend, Eliza, Sabrina, and Roman Holiday’s Princess Ann share one crucial de-sire with Audrey herself: in the words of E. M. Forster, to “only connect.”

Audrey plunged wholeheartedly into My Fair Lady’s promotional whirl,attending no fewer than ten premieres in London, Paris, Rome, Madrid, NewYork, and Hollywood. For the much ballyhooed Hollywood premiere on Oc-tober 24, 1964, she continued her newfound friendship with George Cukor byhappily accepting his invitation to stay at his home. Like comrades who havesurvived a fierce battle, they arrived back at Cukor’s at 3 a.m., and she smil-ingly said to him: “Let’s put up our feet and just sit and enjoy it.” Star anddirector were to remain lifelong friends, and Cukor was saddened that neitherhis plan to direct Audrey as Peter Pan nor a proposed remake of his own 1936version of Romeo and Juliet, to star Audrey with either Terence Stamp or Al-bert Finney, ever came to fruition.

With My Fair Lady riding the wave of multiple rave reviews, it proved nosurprise when, early in the new year, the film scored twelve Academy Awardnominations, second only to Mary Poppins’s thirteen nods. And yet, amid thefanfare heralding a heated competition between My Fair Lady and Mary Pop-pins for Best Film of the Year, it was one missing nomination that seemed togarner more attention than all of the others put together: Audrey Hepburnwas nowhere to be seen in the race for Best Actress. Oh yes, Julie Andrewshad been nominated for playing Mary Poppins, but Audrey, who had carriedMy Fair Lady through nearly every scene, had, it seemed, been rather deliber-ately overlooked.

Everyone, it seemed, had a theory as to why Audrey had not been nomin-ated. Certainly, Julie Andrews’s underdog status helped to turn sentimentagainst Audrey, no matter how unreasonably. The fact that Audrey’s songswere dubbed played right into the sympathy underlying the “Julie waswronged” school of thought, and even Rex Harrison got into the act, stating

of the dubbing controversy: “I think this may have been why she was noteven nominated for an Academy Award, because in my opinion she gave asuperb performance.”

Audrey’s case was also not helped by the fact that she had recently dis-missed her longtime press representative, Henry Rogers, who, if on the scene,could have provided counsel in the lead-up to the announcement of nomina-tions. That squabble with Rogers centered around Audrey’s appearance as thepublic face of Givenchy’s L’Interdit perfume.

Audrey had neither asked for nor received any fee or percentage in regardto the fragrance because, in Givenchy’s words years later: “She never con-sidered ours a business relationship.” But the lack of fee had gnawed at MelFerrer, who then asked Rogers to discuss the matter with Jean-Claude deGivenchy, Hubert’s brother and business manager. At the very same time,Audrey had been invited to the opening of the annual Cannes Film Festival,and Rogers had taken it upon himself to tell the organizers that it would bemost welcome if Audrey were to receive a special award. The Cannes festivaldirector, Robert Favre Le Bret, felt coerced by this “request” and told Audreyherself, who knew nothing of the exchange. Extremely upset, Audrey dis-missed Rogers, a Hollywood veteran who was very well-known within theindustry. Although Audrey and Rogers eventually patched up their differ-ences, at the time of the buildup to the Academy Award nominations, he wasnot on hand to offer counsel about handling the press.

As it was, during the time of screenings and the traditional push for nom-inations, Audrey was back in Switzerland. Her desire to lead a personal lifeled to accusations that she remained aloof, but her Oscar snub may also havebeen deliberately aimed at the ever-cantankerous, notoriously combative andpenny-pinching Jack L. Warner. The studio chief had personally producedMy Fair Lady, and when antipathy toward Warner was combined with sym-pathy for Julie and miscues from Rogers, Audrey’s nomination was doomed.

Audrey did in fact receive a David di Donatello Best Foreign ActressAward, a Golden Globe nomination, and a New York Film Critics CircleBest Actress Award for her Eliza Doolittle, but the missing Oscar nominationdominated all talk. It proved to be such a startling oversight that the LosAngeles Times ran a front-page headline trumpeting: “Julie Andrews Chosen,Audrey Hepburn Omitted.” As stated bluntly in Variety: “Hepburn did theacting, but Marni Nixon subbed for her in the singing department and that’s

what undoubtedly led to her erasure.”

Nixon herself wrote that André Previn and George Cukor blamed her forAudrey not being nominated, stating that both men claimed she had “blabbedtoo much to the press.” Nixon had at first remained silent about the dubbingcontroversy, but as time passed, she began to feel that the longer she refusedto comment, the more the discord grew. As a result, she began speaking outabout her work on the film, later analyzing: “One thing I never wanted was tohurt Audrey, but the can was open and that was that.” By this stage, the de-bate had grown so well known that even comedians had horned in on the act,with Marni relaying Shecky Greene’s joke that he “dreamed last night that Imade a date with Audrey Hepburn, but Marni Nixon showed up.”

Audrey’s own comment about the Oscar nomination controversy wascharacteristically honest: “I’m happy for Julie but sad and disappointed formyself—but that’s the way the members voted. Many other people who gavegreat performances were not nominated either.” Said Julie Andrews: “I thinkAudrey should have been nominated. I’m very sorry she wasn’t.”

Writing frankly to Cukor in a letter dated March 8, 1965, Audrey mused:“I think I am the only one who is not in the dark. . . . It seems to me it is allvery simple—my performance was not up to snuff. . . . If people wanted toensure Julie Andrews’s Oscar, their sentiments would have automaticallybeen cancelled out had my bravura been worthy. . . . Because My Fair Ladymeant so terribly much to me, I had sort of secretly hoped for a nominationbut never, never counted on the Oscar. There, disappointed I is, but notastounded like my chums seem to be or a lot of the press for that matter.What does amaze me is the hullabaloo which ensued and the constant pres-sure which was brought about for almost a week to get me to come to Cali-fornia for the big night . . .”

In the end, the funniest reaction to the controversy may have come fromKatharine Hepburn, who, although not related to Audrey, was known to referto Audrey as her “little daughter.” In typically blunt Katharine Hepburn–speak, she fired off a telegram to Audrey: “Don’t worry about not being nom-inated. Someday you’ll get it for a part that doesn’t rate it.”

On the night of the Oscars, after scooping up wins for scoring, sound, andcinematography, My Fair Lady notched two more Oscars when Cecil Beatonwon for costume design and art direction. Beaton was not at the ceremonies,but Audrey soon wrote him a highly affectionate note: “Darling C.B. Just to

say how happy happy happy happy I am that you received your Oscar. I wishyou could have heard the applause. All my love Audrey xxx.” The film thenscored an even bigger victory when George Cukor was announced as BestDirector. Cukor had previously failed to win for Little Women (1933), Phil-adelphia Story (1940), A Double Life (1947), and Born Yesterday (1950), butafter winning both a Golden Globe and the Director’s Guild of Americaaward for My Fair Lady, Cukor had arrived at the Oscars as the favorite; de-lighted by his win, he bounded up to the stage and proclaimed his thanks with“a deep bow to Mr. Rex Harrison and to adorable Audrey Hepburn.”

In a surreal twist that seemed right out of a Hollywood screenplay, it wasAudrey herself who was called upon to then present the Best Actor Oscar; byAcademy tradition, the Oscar should have been presented by the previousyear’s Best Actress, Patricia Neal, but Neal was dealing with severe healthproblems at the time, and Audrey was asked to fill in as her replacement. AsJulie Andrews anxiously waited to find out if she had won the Best ActressAward for Mary Poppins, Audrey received thunderous applause as she strodebriskly onto the stage in order to announce that the Best Actor of the Yearwas . . . Rex Harrison for My Fair Lady. Taking the stage, Harrison andAudrey hugged and kissed repeatedly, and when Harrison looked at Audreyto proclaim: “I feel in a way I should split this in half,” Audrey murmured,“You deserve it all yourself.” Concluding his remarks, and well aware thatJulie Andrews was mere feet away, Harrison gracefully proclaimed “Deeplove to, uh, well, two fair ladies.” For the egocentric Harrison, winning theOscar represented a bit of revenge on Jack Warner for not initially wanting tocast him in the role, and he later wrote: “There he was, having wanted to re-cast the whole thing for the film, watching me, whom he hadn’t wanted, col-lect my Oscar, and not Audrey, whom he had wanted, while the girl he’dturned down for Eliza, Julie Andrews, won one for another studio.”

Such were the times that no matter what Audrey did when it came to MyFair Lady, she was criticized; the day after the Oscars, Patricia Neal pro-nounced herself “a little hurt and disappointed” that Audrey had not men-tioned her on the telecast, but it was actually Neal’s then husband, the acerbicRoald Dahl, who was most upset, proclaiming: “She and Audrey have knowneach other a long time. And Audrey didn’t even call until the day after the ce-remonies—and that was after I think someone told her that Pat was hurt.Audrey had to leave on a 1 o’clock plane, so she didn’t have time to see Pat

either.” It was an unintentional oversight on Audrey’s part, but Dahl’s com-ments were picked up around the world.

After Julie Andrews received her Oscar, she and Audrey posed backstagehugging each other, with Audrey proclaiming “I’m thrilled for her, ofcourse.” In Julie’s recall of the evening: “All the winners and presenters wereasked to pose for photographs together. I stood next to Audrey, who lookedabsolutely gorgeous. She quietly said to me, ‘Julie, you really should havedone My Fair Lady . . . but I didn’t have the guts to turn it down.’ I told herthat I completely understood, and in the years that followed, we became goodfriends.”

Disappointed as she was not to be nominated, Audrey was surelyheartened by Harrison’s backstage words about Julie’s win: “I wouldn’t con-sider it poetic justice. Julie was marvelous onstage, but Audrey was wonder-ful too.” Explaining further, he added: “Actually I think that in the end,Audrey gave an enchanting performance on film, and there’s no doubt thatshe contributed greatly to the film’s enormous success and lasting popular-ity.” Addressing the differences between his two Eliza Doolittles, he added:“There are very few similarities between the two girls, except that they bothhave extraordinary charm.” John Gielgud, however, went one—or several—steps further than Harrison, bluntly stating that Audrey was “much better thanJulie Andrews.”

The fact was, Audrey did seem genuinely happy for her friend Julie. Thetwo women had long since formed a real friendship, and those in the presshoping for a Joan Crawford/Bette Davis–style feud remained sorely disap-pointed. In fact, when Julie and her husband Blake Edwards spent part ofeach winter in Gstaad, Switzerland, they always visited Audrey. By that timeAudrey’s son Luca was eight, and while he may not have fully understoodwho a celebrity was and exactly what that meant, he did understand thatwhen Julie Andrews visited his house, he was eating dinner with Mary Pop-pins, and that realization interested him greatly. Writing in his book of remin-iscences, he explained: “Julie Andrews put everyone at ease and immediatelybroke the ice, teaching me to whistle through my lower teeth.”

Nonetheless, the Audrey-Julie dubbing controversy continued through thedecades, although eventually with a more humorous edge; when Alan JayLerner died in June of 1986, a memorial service was held at New York’sShubert Theatre and included an appearance by Julie Andrews. Andrews was

to be introduced via a film clip, but inexplicably, her My Fair Lady connec-tion to Lerner was delivered by a clip from the film version, one completewith Audrey Hepburn lip-syncing to Marni Nixon. Clip completed, Julie An-drews walked onstage and forthrightly ad-libbed: “Hello, everyone, I’mMarni Nixon!”

In the end, the contretemps over Audrey’s casting and lip-syncing over-shadowed the significance of her achievement in the role, a state of affairsmade all the more ironic when placed in the perspective of movie history.Rita Hayworth’s world-famous and iconic “Put The Blame on Mame” inGilda (1946) was voiced by Anita Ellis, not Rita, yet that has not stopped thesong and dance from becoming the most famous striptease in film history. Noone made a fuss over Marni Nixon dubbing Deborah’s Kerr’s vocals in TheKing and I, just as no one grew exercised over Carol Lawrence’s signaturerole of Maria in West Side Story being given to Natalie Wood. The fact thatthe Russian-American Natalie Wood was playing the Puerto Rican Mariacame in for scant comment, nor did the redoubtable Nixon’s dubbing ofWood’s voice. But, in the case of My Fair Lady, Julie Andrews had provedan overwhelmingly sympathetic figure, and even though it was against herwishes to be dubbed, Audrey was pilloried for that very fact.

Fifty-six years later, when Rami Malek portrayed famed rock singer Fred-die Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), he lip-synced every song to Mer-cury’s own vocals—and received an Academy Award as Best Actor for hisefforts.

Tempus fugit.

# Chapter Twenty-EightWHAT COULD GO WRONG? 1960s

“I knew how difficult it had to be to be married to a world celebrity, recog-nised everywhere, second billed on the screen and in real life. How Melsuffered. But believe me, I put my career second.”

—Audrey Hepburn

IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS following Sean’s birth, the whispers of the Holly-wood gossipmongers had grown into a chorus: “Mel is holding Audrey back,Mel controls every one of Audrey’s decisions.” And yet for the time being,the marriage endured, because in their rush to judgment, Mel’s detractors ig-nored one not so insignificant fact: Audrey Hepburn was a very smart wo-man, and if she trusted Mel, then there was a solid reason for that: he was anintelligent man and the possessor of show business savvy, a smart, steadyingpartner whose instincts helped Audrey shape her career choices. Oft forgottenin the contretemps, in fact, was that the control issue cut both ways. As oneof Mel’s friends noted in regards to Audrey’s influence on the peripateticMel: “You won’t believe this but he has actually begun to sit still.”

It was Mel who advised Audrey to hire Henry Rogers as her press agent,and even more significantly, to employ the ex-boxer and ski instructor KurtFrings as her agent. Frings, who at one point had represented both Olivia deHavilland and Elizabeth Taylor, had originally been recommended by hispoker buddy, Billy Wilder, and contrary to the merry-go-round of Hollywoodagentry, Audrey stayed the course with Frings throughout her career. SaysSean: “Based on what I saw and what she told me, my parents would discussthe creative aspects of a film she was considering—the script and the con-tents and packaging. Kurt then came in for the financial deal: he was a bull-dog who would go after the money. . . . Once the first deal had been set by

Kurt—choice of makeup artist, hair stylist, travel—those aspects would berepeated in every agreement. It then became a matter of how much she re-ceived up front and what percentage of the gross. My mother was able to sep-arate: my father advised on the artistic front and Kurt dealt with the busi-ness.”

Even Robert Wolders gave Mel solid credit for helping Audrey’s career,noting: “People conveniently forget that they made a lot of good choices to-gether.” In the end, however, it may just be that the most perceptive analysisof the supposed Mel-Audrey, Svengali-Trilby relationship came from the stillpining William Holden: “I think Audrey allows Mel to think he influencesher.”

Audrey certainly trusted Mel’s judgment, so how exactly did their mar-riage begin to unravel? In the words of Ernest Hemingway on the subject ofbankruptcy, it happened in two ways: “Gradually and then suddenly.” Aftersix years of marriage, times were changing rapidly: the seemingly quiescentEisenhower years had given way to the vibrant presidency of JFK, and thestrict societal roles assigned to men and women were now loosening up. Butwhile Audrey maintained her status as one of the most successful actresses inthe world, landing lead roles in feature films was proving increasingly diffi-cult for Mel. As Audrey scored an Oscar nomination for The Nun’s Story(1959) and nabbed the most sought-after role of the decade in My Fair Lady(1964), Mel was reduced to filming cameos in Audrey’s films Charade(1963) and Paris When It Sizzles (1964), before moving into guest star ap-pearances on television.

The problem lay in the fact that Mel’s greatest talent seemed to lie not inacting but as a producer, a job in which his network of relationships and un-derstanding of how Hollywood worked stood him in great stead. Audrey, infact, told Sean years later: “Your father was the producer of my career.” Ex-plained Sean: “He was a good producer because he had done it all. He was adancer, an actor, assistant producer, director, and veteran of radio. He couldride horses, fence, knew many people—he had a complete vision of the in-dustry. He had started when he was eighteen and when my parents met, mymother was twenty-three and he was thirty-seven. He was smart and a showbusiness veteran, advising her on possible films. He pushed for her to doNun’s Story and chose Terence Young as director for Wait Until Dark. Hehad a breadth of experience that was very helpful to my mother.”

But Mel wanted to act, and because he was married to one of the biggeststars in the world, his career was constantly compared to his wife’s, and inev-itably found wanting. In show business terms, he lacked the X factor of ap-peal which defines any onscreen star, and when the marriage was breakingup, Yul Brynner, whose second wife Doris was among Audrey’s closestfriends, bluntly opined: “I’m sure that, above everything, Mel was jealous ofher success, and he could not reconcile himself to the cold facts of life. Shewas much better than he in every way, so he was taking it out on her.” Ex-pounding further, Brynner added: “Finally she couldn’t take it any longer.God knows, she did everything a woman could do to save her marriage.”

Brynner had a vested interest in this analysis, given wife Doris’s closefriendship with Audrey; one need only look at newsreel footage of Audrey,returning to Switzerland after the 1965 My Fair Lady Oscars, happily bound-ing down airplane steps and giving Doris a big hug, to know how deep thatfriendship had grown. But was Yul Brynner right? Was Mel actually jealousof Audrey’s success? Speaking in 1996, three years after Audrey’s death, Melstated: “I don’t think anybody could compete with Audrey and there was nosense in trying to. I had a great deal to do with her career, and I’m delighted Iwas able to contribute. But I didn’t benefit from it. . . .” Continuing his self-analysis he emphatically concluded: “I was not competitive nor was I con-trolling.”

Mel seemed more aware of the problems found in living with a superstarwife than did anyone else: “It’s a problem when the wife outshines the hus-band as Audrey does me. I’m pretty sensitive when producers call and saythey want to discuss a film with me, when in reality they’re angling forAudrey and using me as bait.” Commented Audrey’s longtime publicistHarry Rogers about the marriage at this time: “Rarely did I ever see herhappy. . . . It seemed to me that she loved him more than he loved her, and itwas frustrating. . . . She was filled with love. Mel was filled with ambition,for his wife and for himself.”

The difficult times now seemed to occur more and more frequently, andMel’s domineering ways and surprisingly straitlaced code of behavior did nothelp matters. Billy Wilder’s smart and stylish wife Audrey claimed that as farback as the filming of 1957’s Love in the Afternoon, when Audrey spilled adrink and muttered “Shit!” at her own clumsiness, Mel was so incensed atthis profanity that he stalked out of the restaurant in which they were all din-

Still, Audrey tried to keep her marriage intact for Sean’s sake, and whenthe disagreements occurred more frequently, she redoubled her efforts. Sheeven spoke of the commitment to her marriage in the same breath as her all-out work-until-you-drop approach to My Fair Lady: “I also told myself . . . ifyou have a grain of energy or thought or emotion left in you, you’re not giv-ing this role enough. And that philosophy holds true not only for my work,but for my marriage too.”

She had turned down any possible return to Broadway in order to be withMel, explaining at the time of My Fair Lady’s premiere: “I would love to doanother play or musical, but it presents tremendous problems with the mix ofprivate life and career. Being in a play for months on end is very tough. Wedon’t live in New York, and I like to follow my husband wherever he goes.”She had, in fact, made no fewer than sixteen trips in eight months “throughevery part of Europe in order that Mel never be left alone.” Rumors of Mel’sinfidelity now began floating around show business circles, and eventuallythe talk of divorce turned into a dull roar that prompted then powerful NewYork City gossip columnist Earl Wilson to call Audrey in Switzerland at 5a.m. What, he wondered, was the state of Audrey’s marriage?

In truth, there had been no scandals, no drunken binges or out-of-controlbehavior. The problems were simply too big to overcome: the fact thatAudrey’s career greatly eclipsed Mel’s, as well as Mel’s need, likely com-pensatory in nature, to exert control—even his desire to reside right in thecenter of the show business action while Audrey preferred the remoteEuropean countryside—it all added to the weight of a crumbling marriage un-til the cumulative pressure left their union hanging by a thread.

# Chapter Twenty-Nine

# FOR THE LOVE OF ANIMALS, 1957–1993

“I walk my dogs to keep me fit. I talk to my dogs, which keeps me sane. Ican’t think of anything that makes one happier than to cuddle and play andstart the day with a warm puppy.”

—Audrey Hepburn

UNHAPPY IN HER MARRIAGE AUDREY may have been, but even with her marriageto Mel growing more fragile by the day, Audrey still found an abundance ofpersonal joy in two places: with Sean and in her life-changing companionshipwith her pets.

It was during the filming of Love in the Afternoon (1957) that Mel gaveAudrey a Yorkshire terrier whom she immediately named “Mr. Famous.” Notyet a mother at the time and possessed of an instinct to protect the most vul-nerable members of society, Audrey poured all of her pent-up affection ontoher new companion, who quickly lived up to his name and became one of themost well-known dogs on the planet.

He also proved to be noticeably ill behaved, with Audrey Wilder reportingthat he urinated on her Louis XIV chairs. Perhaps the accident should havecome as no surprise, given that Mr. Famous was already on tranquilizers dueto his nervous behavior when having to cross any road. So quickly did Mr.Famous come to rule the roost that he became noticeably jealous when Ip, theGreen Mansions fawn, came to live in the house. If Ip could, and did, eat hismeals in the house, well then Mr. Famous would begin sleeping on Audrey’sbed.

This overt love of animals permeated all aspects of Audrey’s life, withJohn Isaac, the UNICEF photographer who accompanied Audrey on many ofher charitable trips observing: “Whenever we saw cats or dogs she would

straight away go and pet them even if they were on the street.”

By this time Audrey’s image was so pristine that it came as an hilarioussurprise to learn that during her London chorus girl days, when a stray theatrecat was taken home by her friend Bob Monkhouse, she suggested that the catbe called “Tomorrow”; a puzzled Monkhouse asked her about the name, anda guileless Audrey explained that the cat had been castrated, and “you knowwhat they say about tomorrow never coming.” A highly amused Monkhouseallowed as how “Audrey was rather good with jokes.” Said the acerbic andwitty Billy Wilder: “She was kind of a little frivolous, you know, in herjokes. She was not all Virgin Mary. It’s just that when it came out of hermouth, it was twice as funny.”

In the midst of her failing marriage, it was dogs for whom Audrey pro-fessed unadulterated love: “Who thinks you’re as fantastic as your dogdoes?” Audrey understood and related to a dog’s fragility: “No person, andfew children . . . are as unpremeditated, as understanding . . . they only ask tosurvive . . . completely vulnerable. And this complete vulnerability is whatenables you to open up your heart completely, which you rarely do in a hu-man being.” People disappointed, but dogs never did.

So central a part did the dogs come to play in her life that although thenumber-one reason she began to work less frequently lay in her determinationto be fully present for her sons, her dogs constituted the second major reasonfor her screen absences: she simply did not want to spend more than twoweeks away from home because she—and her late-in-life companion RobbieWolders—did not want to leave their dogs. A cameo in Steven Spielberg’s1989 film Always? Fine. Her entire role could be shot in four days. An exten-ded three-month shooting schedule away from Switzerland and her dogs? Nothank you.

Home and dogs helped Audrey feel grounded. And as a mother and petlover, how did 1960s-era Hollywood make her feel?

Modest. Grateful.

Uncertain.

# Chapter ThirtyA BEAUTIFUL UNCERTAINTY

“I’m terribly uncomfortable seeing myself onscreen. Terribly critical ofmyself. I don’t like what I see. That’s why my success is a miracle to me—the audience sees something that I don’t see.”

—Audrey Hepburn

GIVEN THE STRATOSPHERIC LEVEL OF Hollywood stardom Audrey occupied, theextraordinary thing about her personality and concern for others was that shecategorically refused to indulge in even the slightest bit of “I’m a star” beha-vior. Observers on set were startled to realize that she remained filled withself-doubt even while immersed in a lifestyle so rarified that her Nun’s Storycastmate Patricia Bosworth recounted an afternoon on set when Audrey’s as-sistant approached her to quietly whisper: “Miss Hepburn would like you tojoin her for tea tomorrow. Givenchy is flying in from Paris to show her hisnew collection and she thought you’d enjoy seeing it with her.”

The unknown gamine clad in ballet slippers and a “Venezia” boater wasnow being personally shown Hubert de Givenchy’s latest collection. It wasenough to turn anyone’s head, and yet it never did affect Audrey—not at thebeginning of her career, not at her peak, and absolutely never at the end. BillyWilder, never a pushover, called her bracingly modest, and the self-doubt shefelt throughout her entire career proved genuine. When speaking to her friendDominick Dunne about the acclaim that routinely fell her way, she remarked:“And you sort of don’t believe any of it, and yet you’re terribly grateful.”

That sense of gratitude and modesty remained with her for life; nearlyevery interview from the 1950s through the 1980s is peppered with constantreferences to the luck she felt in having worked with great directors rangingfrom Wyler and Wilder to Stanley Donen and Steven Spielberg. Hers was a

professional’s astute awareness that she had come along at exactly the righttime, arriving in a more innocent world where her fairy-tale Hollywood filmscould be crafted as the epitome of wish fulfillment.

Audrey’s least impressed fan always remained Audrey herself, but thenagain, given her upbringing, how could it be otherwise? Ella was disconcer-ted enough that Audrey made a living by making a spectacle of herself, butbragging about it simply would never pass muster. No, adherence to Ella’smantra that concern for others was most important remained with Audrey atall times. Said Audrey herself: “You can tell more about a person by what hesays about others than you can by what others say about him.” Uninterestedin Hollywood gossip, she focused her gaze and undivided attention upon herfriends, with close friend Anna Cataldi observing: “After five minutes withAudrey you forgot who she was for everybody else.” Connie Wald’s son An-drew explained Audrey’s fame and down-to-earth affect in show businessterms: “Being around her was like traveling with a rock star who was nice toyou.”

It was this note of genuine interest in others that was immediately apparentto award-winning fashion designer Jeffrey Banks, whose lifelong fascinationwith Audrey grew into a strong friendship of many years standing:

I had been in love with Audrey since I was nine or ten years old. As ayoung boy I thought she was the most beautiful, charming, gorgeouscreature ever. I thought “Maybe someday I’ll be lucky enough to bein the same room with her.”

I would go to the library in Washington, D.C., and pull everymagazine and article I could find about Audrey, particularly if it wasabout Funny Face. I finally saw it at a revival house in D.C. on adouble bill with Lili—and I made my mother sit through Lili a secondtime because of Funny Face! It’s my favorite movie of all time: It hasfashion, Paris, Avedon, Astaire, and above all else, Audrey. Yearslater when I received an email asking if I’d be interested in providingfashion commentary for the fiftieth anniversary DVD release, I in-stantly wrote back: “Yes! And you don’t have to pay me!” Ishouldn’t have said that.

So, when I first met John Rizzuto, who was the VP of Givenchy

Fragrances in the U.S., I instantly blurted out: “Do you know AudreyHepburn?” He did and nicely said, “I’ll call you when she’s next inthe United States.” This was in the 1980s, and one month later hecalled me and said Audrey would be in New York for a celebrationof Givenchy’s career at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT).

I called FIT and told them I would buy a whole table if it wasnext to Audrey’s. Then I called my friend Renny Reynolds, the flor-ist, and said: “I want one dozen red roses—no two dozen—no fourdozen! I want them for Audrey Hepburn.” He put together whatamounted to a small tree of roses—it was so big I got to the dinnerearly and hid it underneath the skirt of the table.

Between the first and second courses John introduced me toAudrey and when I brought out the red roses she was definitelystartled. Of course, I hadn’t given any thought to how she was goingto transport this tree of roses and she was very gracious but had afaraway look in her eyes. I had built up our meeting so much in myimagination that I was somewhat dismayed.

My friends could see I was disappointed, and the next morningJohn called me and said: “I could tell you were not thrilled, but youmust know Audrey was not herself last night. Her mother had justslipped and broken a hip at Audrey’s home in Switzerland, andAudrey was so concerned about her mother that she almost didn’tcome to New York. But—she didn’t want to disappoint Hubert andall the people who had bought tickets, so she took a train to Paris, theConcorde to New York, and then this morning turned around and didthe same thing in reverse. Next time you meet her it will be com-pletely different.”

That next time came when I was invited to the taping of theTurner Classic Movies salute to Audrey. I assumed I’d be a part ofthe audience at the studio on 23rd Street. Well, there was no audience—it was just the crew, Audrey, Robbie Wolders, and me. I wasthrilled, and she was charming, gracious—everything you could hopefor.

After that I started sending her flowers every time she came toNew York. When she received the Film Society of New York Charlie

Chaplin award in 1991, I had flowers sent to her hotel suite. Thenight of the gala I was entering the theatre and heard someone callingmy name. It was Audrey who came over, arms outstretched, and gaveme what seemed like fourteen kisses on my checks, thanking me forthe flowers. This was her night—a lifetime achievement award—andyet she was more concerned with thanking me for some flowers. Thatsays everything about her.

When the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA)gave their first lifetime achievement award to Ralph Lauren, Audreywas asked to present the award, so I picked Audrey and Robbie up atthe airport and brought them to their hotel. We sat and talked in theirsuite, and she literally didn’t talk one bit about herself. That didn’t in-terest her. She asked about me and her concern was honest. Whenyou were with her, she made you feel like you were the only personin the world who mattered. She had perfect manners. I’m a designer,and Audrey is the ultimate style icon, and yet we rarely talked aboutfashion. We talked about her work with UNICEF. Working withUNICEF gave her purpose and joy.

After I left, I called my friend Renny again, and I went on andon saying I wanted to send her lilies of the valley, peonies, I need thisand I need that, and finally as I was running on and on he said: “Jef-frey you haven’t told me how much you want to spend,” and I said:“It’s for Audrey Hepburn. Money is no object!” Which was not asmart answer for me to give to a very expensive florist. . . . The lasttime I saw Audrey, when she received an award at the Waldorf As-toria, she leaned over to me at dinner and said: “Jeffrey—the flowershave to stop. It’s too much.” I said to her: “It’s never enough foryou,” and we both laughed.

The one other famous person who struck me the same way inher concern for others was when I met Princess Diana. I told her thatI had been to the London Lighthouse AIDS hospice because I knewshe had often visited patients there. She took my hand, looked me inthe eye, and said: “Besides my children, that is my life’s work.” Shereally made me think of Audrey. They both connected to you in animmediate way.

The parallel to Princess Diana proved apt. Both women endured painful mar-riages and were devoted to their two sons. Both were revered as fashion iconsof such extraordinary appeal that their dresses sold for $\$ 1$ million nearly aquarter century after they died. Most notably, however, each woman foundpersonal fulfillment in dedication to social causes: Diana with the campaignagainst land mines and Audrey in working for UNICEF. Using their start-lingly intuitive emotional intelligence, both icons possessed the uncanny abil-ity to make hundreds of people gathered in a ballroom feel as if they were be-ing addressed one-on-one, and in the process raised millions for charity.

That genuine interest in others, the ability to forge a strong connection,was exactly what Cecil Beaton’s biographer Hugo Vickers experienced whenhe interviewed Audrey in March of 1983. Accustomed to moving in thehighest circles of society, Vickers was nonetheless reduced to awestruck ad-miration by their conversation, writing in his diary: “There are momentswhen the world seems suddenly to stand very still and this is one of them. Ihave just talked for twenty-five minutes to Audrey Hepburn. She was sosweet and adorable and so nice about Cecil. . . . From her very first ‘hello’she was the total embodiment of all that I’ve always admired in her. . . . Afterher call there was a still and calmness in the flat. Nobody rang up for half anhour. And I was alone on an elevated plane.”

Audrey’s interest in the welfare of others and the care with which she re-sponded to her friends’ concerns welled up out of her own fragile self, hergorgeous exterior hiding a still shy little girl who, in her oft-repeated andself-revealing words, wanted desperately to both give and receive love. Saysher granddaughter Emma Ferrer, born six months after Audrey died: “I thinkshe was chasing unconditional love her whole life. She wanted to love and beloved. And I think she got it in her life, but I don’t think she got it from a lotof people. For a woman who’s the most loved in the world to have such alack of love is so sad.”

It was the mixture of joie de vivre and bone-deep sadness, her insistenceupon finding joy among the world’s many disappointments that proved socompelling to audiences and friends alike. When any of Audrey’s charactersappeared sad onscreen, every audience member understood that she wasn’tpretending. Drawing upon her own disappointments and upsets allowed herinstinctive gifts as an actress to flower, enabling her to express the pain feltby Sister Luke in The Nun’s Story or the hurt felt by a cast-aside Eliza

Doolittle in My Fair Lady. Audiences intuited that secrets and uncertainty re-mained, her darkest memories withheld lest they disrupt or prove too painfulin the revelation. As with Garbo, a mystery remained, and audiences respec-ted and understood her need to withhold. Wrote Patricia Bosworth: “She’ssomething of a mystery. Enigmatic, detached, but irresistible.”

Delving deeper into the extraordinary effect Audrey’s presence had on themost hardened of Hollywood veterans, Bosworth continued: “I watchedspellbound as she glided across the floor toward me, her feet barely touchingthe ground. . . . She greeted me as if she’d been waiting to meet me all herlife, which I suspect is how she greeted everyone. [Her face] radiated suchbeauty and sadness.” In the perfectly judged words of her Nun’s Story co-star, the formidable Dame Edith Evans: “It’s as if she’s from another world.”

# THE NATURE OF THE APPEAL, 1953–1993

# Audrey, Grace, Doris, and Jackie

“Over the years we chose three style icons from the twentieth century towrite about: Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Jacqueline Onassis. Peopleenjoyed reading about all three, but the greatest response, hands down, wasto Audrey.”

—Pamela Fiori, editor in chief, Town and Country

TO FRIENDS AND CO-STARS RANGING from Dame Edith Evans to Harry Belafonte,Audrey may have appeared to be paying a visit from another world, but toAmerican women in the 1950s and 1960s, her look in the 1950s and 1960sappealed precisely because the bandanas, capri pants, and ballet flats shefavored all seemed notably un-American in style. Main Street USA was nolonger in favor, and for upscale postwar American women, chic, EuropeanAudrey pointed the way to a different look. Yes, there was a touch of theAmerican sporty WASP ethos in the Lacoste shirts with upturned collars thatshe favored, but everything Audrey wore was overlaid with a refined, modernEuropean flair. Uncertain she remained in her professional life, but neverwhen it came to her clothes.

Audrey may have been wearing the most expensive designer dresses onthe planet, and her natural style of movement may have suggested that shewas about to step onstage into the rarified world of Swan Lake, but for menand women alike, she still exuded a sense of playfulness. Forget theGivenchy she’s wearing in Sabrina—when she spins around in Linus’s chairbefore sprawling onto the conference room table, there isn’t a trace of aristo-cratic hauteur: this girl was fun, and audiences knew it right away. If there’s

such a creature as a down-to-earth elitist, then Audrey Hepburn is it:European in style but mixed with a distinctly American playfulness. Whichmakes it a loss for everyone that she never had the opportunity to play therole of the goddess Venus in the Kurt Weill musical One Touch of Venus.Mixing elegance and comic situations, this Venus would have floated aroundthe soundstage, dressed by Givenchy while singing “I’m a Stranger Here My-self” and “Speak Low.” Oh, what might have been.

The appeal of this particular Venus began not with the designer clothes butinstead with her confiding persona, the warmth in her eyes transmitting towomen in the audience the feeling that she would make a real and trust-worthy friend, one worthy of the most personal of confidences.

The invitation to confide was inherent in that mysterious voice, an uniden-tifiable continental accent mixing her British and Dutch backgrounds intodrawn-out vowels and crisply enunciated consonants, all of it anchored byemphases upon unexpected syllables (a decided part of the appeal in herbanter with Cary Grant in Charade). Her speech proved inviting, even mys-terious, but, in Audrey’s own analysis, having grown up speaking Dutch inher house, French in the outside world, and English during her years ofschooling in Kent, “There is no speech I can relax into when I’m tired, be-cause my ear has never been accustomed to one intonation. It’s because Ihave no mother tongue that the critics accuse me of curious speech.”

Far from being an affectation, her quiet, nearly confessional voice was anatural reflection of a childhood spent in multiple European countries as wellas a reaction to the years spent listening to her parents’ raised voices. If F.Scott Fitzgerald’s Daisy Buchanan always spoke with a voice full of money,then Audrey’s voice, in Cecil Beaton’s memorable phrase, always possessed“the quality of heartbreak.”

Just like another actress named Hepburn, absolutely no one else soundedquite like Audrey. Never raising her voice, she effortlessly invited any vieweror audience member to lean in and establish a connection. Said StanleyDonen: “To me, Ella Fitzgerald has the most tranquilizing singing voice onearth, and Audrey has the most tranquilizing speaking one.” Clearly under thespell of Audrey’s voice, he added: “Her voice was enough to soothe yourjangled nerves . . . she surrounded (her words) with the consistency of honey.She captivated even in the dark.”

Audiences remained intrigued and then, it is not too hyperbolic a claim,

grew enthralled, the alluring voice made all the more effective when accom-panied by a megawatt smile.

Capable of conveying the sheer joy found in simply being alive, Audrey’ssmile was nonetheless often tinged with sadness. Julia Roberts may possessan equally famous and all-encompassing smile, but there is never any sadnessabout it. She is simply too sturdy and upright to convey genuine heartbreak,while Audrey had to consciously work toward banishing her feelings of sad-ness; no matter the situation, she felt a need to put her best foot forward, andin the process will herself toward optimism: “Happy girls are the prettiestgirls” she famously said—and meant. She would, unceasingly, march straightthrough her sadness, declaring “Nothing’s impossible. The word itself says‘I’m possible!’”

That smile, chic, and cool beauty would seem to bring about an immediatecomparison to another legendary Hollywood beauty, Grace Kelly, who, likeAudrey, was born in 1929, established herself as a paragon of style, and alsodied a tragically early death—in her case at age 52. Audrey and Grace didshare Hollywood history and the winning of Academy Awards, but they op-erated in completely different ways within the Hollywood hothouse. Eachpossessed a genuine beauty and exquisite manners, but even though layers ofpassion existed beneath their respective controlled exteriors, Kelly possesseda coolness unknown to Audrey, a sense that the world was her oyster neverconveyed by Audrey.

The more interesting comparison is with Audrey’s contemporary in Holly-wood stardom, Doris Day. In fact, Audrey’s declaration that other womencould easily look like her was, in its own way, as pleasantly preposterous astatement as calling Doris Day the girl next door; no girl next door lookedlike Doris Day, sang like a million dollars, and could dance and act for andwith everyone from Alfred Hitchcock to Bob Fosse and James Cagney. Thebeauty of Doris and Audrey’s mutual affect lay in the fact that both womenmade it look so easy that audiences thought that they too could conquer Hol-lywood with just a little effort.

Both Day and Hepburn felt a lifelong loss from their fathers walking outwhen they were still very young, both reached their peak years of popularityin the 1950s and early 1960s, and even more notably, both managed the neattrick of appealing equally to men and women. Just as Audrey’s beauty andsense of fun made her worthy of admiration by both sexes, Doris’s forthright

career-woman independence appealed to 1950s homebound women at thesame time that men were attracted to her sunshiny girl next door sex appeal.In the words of their mutual co-star James Garner: “Doris exuded sex, but shemade you smile about it.”

Audrey never did function as a fantasy figure in the manner of MarilynMonroe, Elizabeth Taylor, or Rita Hayworth. Yes, men found her to be warmand intelligent, but her sex appeal surfaced in a lowkey, simmering, back-burner kind of way. In her own words: “I’m not as well-stacked as SophiaLoren or Gina Lollobrigida . . . there is more to sex appeal than just measure-ments. I don’t need a bedroom to prove my womanliness. I can convey just asmuch appeal fully clothed, picking apples off a tree or standing in the rain.”Said Billy Wilder: “When she stood before the cameras she became MissAudrey Hepburn. And she could put it on a little bit, the sexiness, and the ef-fect was really something.”

Men responded to Audrey’s intelligence and impeccable bearing, sensingthat she expected a certain standard of good behavior. For all of the tomboyattributes of short hair and a relatively flat chest, Audrey remained intenselyfeminine, and the fact that she did not self-consciously display an overt sexu-ality à la Monroe helped make the age differences with her legendary andolder leading men seem palatable. Men wanted to protect her, but not becausethey felt she would fall apart at any moment like Monroe. No—for all her ap-parent fragility and air of needing protection, she always projected a core ofinner strength that deepened the appeal, speaking as it did to the sense of avery equal partnership.

It was that sense of equal partnership that similarly informed Day’s pair-ings with a who’s-who of Hollywood’s biggest stars: James Garner, FrankSinatra, and Clark Gable. In her most famous screen partnership of all, herthree comedies with Rock Hudson, Day too morphed into a fashion icon, anindependent career woman decked out in the latest fashions designed by JeanLouis and Irene. The similarities with Audrey did not stop with fashion but infact extended to their professional and personal lives as well. Like Audrey,Doris had begun decades of hard work while still a teenager, singing on theroad with big bands just as Audrey danced in the chorus of West End music-als. Both worked nonstop through their peak years, with Day making thirty-nine movies and recording over six hundred songs.

Most notably of all, however, each woman walked away from Hollywood

on her own terms: Audrey after Wait Until Dark in the late ’60s, and Doris inthe mid-’70s after the successful five-year run of her television series. For allthe differences between Day’s all-American pep and Audrey’s continental-flavored sophistication, not only did both women seem incapable of lying,but they also shared a refusal to view the world through the protective prismof irony. Instead, both led with their heart, and if hurt by those close to them(Doris weathered four unsuccessful marriages), they shared a combination ofvulnerability and strength that made audiences embrace them as friends, wo-men who instilled confidence about life’s possibilities. Maybe, both womenseemed to suggest, happiness really did lie just around the corner.

It seemed fitting that both Audrey and Doris found happiness and a senseof peace in the final acts of their lives, away from the Hollywood machine:Audrey with UNICEF, Doris in her work on behalf of animal welfare. Be-loved by their co-stars, each woman exuded a genuine sense of modesty. IfDoris famously stated, “If I can do it, anyone can do it,” and if Audrey neverdid understand the fuss about her appearance—“I see the problems when Iget up in the morning and I do my best to do well”—their mutual self-deprec-ation came from a place of genuine modesty.

Audrey always did remain the one star capable of convincingly stating,“I’m not in love with my looks.” In fact, she often went much further whenasked what she would like to change about her appearance: “Oh I’d like to benot so flat-chested. I’d like not to have . . . such big feet, such a big nose.” Intypical Audrey fashion she gracefully added: “Actually I’m very grateful forwhat God’s given me. I’ve done pretty well,” but in her blithe estimation:“No, I don’t think girls would like to look like me. Maybe they would like tobe an actress like me. Who would I like to be? Elizabeth Taylor is the one Iwould like to look like. I think most females would; she’s so beautiful.”

There was no faux modesty in Audrey’s self-analysis because she genu-inely believed that she was not beautiful. So self-critical was she that sheeven found her shoulders to be subpar, telling Hedda Hopper in 1953: “I’vealways wanted really feminine shoulders that sort of slope down.”

Interviewed by Cecil Beaton’s biographer Hugo Vickers, in one brief spanshe put down her own extraordinary beauty no fewer than three times: “Oh,there’s nothing terribly unusual about me. . . . There’s not something all thatspecial about me. . . . There’s nothing very flamboyant about me or anythingterribly beautiful or anything.” Billy Wilder, for one, disagreed strongly, stat-

ing in later years: “Audrey Hepburn was something special because she wasnot ‘pretty.’ She was very beautiful.”

Wilder was right and Audrey was wrong because no other Hollywood starever quite harnessed that singular combination of grace, voice, and intelli-gence. Her appearance and style seemed at once unexpected and yet alwayspresent—as if she had burst forth fully formed, sui generis.

Said Sean in later years: “[She was] the perfect package of imperfections,”a phrase that to him seemed to encompass both her beauty and a genuinesense of modesty, not only because she possessed a heightened sense of herown imperfections, but also because “the definition of beauty is not knowingthat you are so special.”

Where others saw a style icon, Audrey simply wanted to go her own way.And if she was, in her looks and style, utterly unique, did she have any peerswhen it came to setting fashion trends?

Perhaps only one: Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.

It is ironic then, that the connection between Audrey Hepburn and theKennedy family had begun with John F. Kennedy, not Jackie, when, back in1952, Audrey met the then senator who quickly declared her his favorite act-ress. The duo even managed an innocuous date before their respective ro-mantic interests turned elsewhere, and it was Audrey who, at PresidentKennedy’s request, sang “Happy [Forty-Sixth] Birthday” to him in May of1963 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, in celebration of what turned out to be hisfinal birthday.

But it was Jackie with whom Audrey was ceaselessly compared over thedecades, their images and fame continually mingling in interesting and com-plicated ways. Both women were highly involved mothers of two children.Each endured a pair of troubled marriages to men who proved difficult andself-involved, until both found lasting love and happiness with men they didnot marry—financier Maurice Tempelsman for Jackie, actor Robert Woldersfor Audrey.

Audrey and Jackie both possessed the now-vanished quality of allure, andnotwithstanding Jackie’s American citizenship, each managed the rather non-American quality of holding part of herself in reserve. Here were two womenwho functioned most happily just out of the spotlight but found themselveson the covers of hundreds, indeed thousands, of magazines. Both remainedclotheshorses who set global trends, and yet, notably, it was Jackie who fol-

lowed Audrey’s lead. Said Givenchy of Audrey: “Her style was born as wenow know it: the sophisticated sheath, the shoulder grazing decollete, the fullskirt, a scarf tied around the head, and the pillbox hat that were immediatelyadopted by many clients, most notably by Jackie Kennedy.” JacquelineKennedy Onassis, fashionista, was clandestinely looking to Audrey for fash-ion tips.

Audrey, it turned out, remained a lifelong subject of fascination for bothJackie and her close friend, singer Carly Simon. Writing about that attractionin her memoir Touched by the Sun, Simon relates that the two women actu-ally discussed how each reminded the other of Audrey: “For me Jackie wasthe Audrey Hepburn of War and Peace and My Fair Lady. For Jackie, I wasthe Audrey Hepburn of Funny Face. I wore the Funny Face black turtleneckand ballet slippers look, while she was the very incarnation of Audrey’s finalpersona in My Fair Lady, as perfect as if she were created by Henry Hig-gins.”

Jackie and Audrey met only once, in the late 1980s, by chance at theCarlyle Hotel in New York City. Alas, the subjects discussed remainedknown only to the two women, but each would have recognized in the othernot just a fellow fashion icon but the possessor of a similar bedrock refusal totalk about one’s personal life. Jackie chose the gilded life of New York City,where her every move and outfit were dissected at close range, but she wouldretreat to her compound on Martha’s Vineyard to rest and restore, just asAudrey returned to La Paisible at every possible opportunity.

The underlying link between the two women, the fascinating connection,is that for all of their worldwide fame and status as fashion trendsetters, itwas their self-perceived flaws that informed their very self-images. Both wo-men proved to be genuinely modest about their looks, plagued by self-doubtabout their appearance. Both felt self-conscious about their (supposedly)large hands and feet, each was relatively flat chested, and just as Audrey wor-ried about her nose and irregular teeth, Jackie felt her eyes were set too farapart.

Jackie might confess her self-doubts to intimates, but never to others,while Audrey simply discussed her supposed flaws before anyone else could.This need to list all of her own shortcomings remained with Audrey her entirelife, and in the end, only increased her connection to her female fans. Shenever could understand the praise for her looks but nonetheless remained

grateful for all that had come her way. Said Sean: “She felt honored andthankful for the attention, which is why she was always on time, she alwaysknew her lines, and she always treated everyone around her with courtesy andrespect.”

# Chapter Thirty-TwoFASHIONISTA, 1953–1993

“She created her very own style, in which I am proud to have played a part—a style that remains both modern and yet timeless. Audrey was the epi-tome of elegance, in both body and soul.”

—Hubert de Givenchy

THE APPEAL OF AUDREY’S PERSONA was of course heightened by the fashions shechose, clothes worn with such style and flair that by the mid-1950s, her firstname alone served as fashion shorthand: anyone hearing the words “That’s soAudrey!” immediately understood the reference.

And what exactly did “That’s so Audrey!” mean? In the most basic terms,it served as shorthand for an elegant clean look that would not date. In Sean’swords: “Beautiful evening dresses by Givenchy and Valentino. Pea coats inwinter with the collars turned up, spread-toe boots in the ’70s, cotton pantsand Lacoste in the summer, ballet slippers and robe around the house in themorning.” Avatar of high fashion she may have been, but Audrey brought thehighest of fashion down to earth, and in the words of one commentator, madeit “emotionally accessible” to the moviegoing audience.

Even if her emotional accessibility arrived via the world’s most expensiveclothing, women still felt the look was readily available, a view Audrey en-dorsed: “My look is attainable. Women can look like Audrey Hepburn byflipping out their hair, buying the large sunglasses, and the little sleevelessdresses.”

Her body: a rail-thin model’s frame: 32″-20″-35″, 5 feet, 7 inches tall, and110 pounds—110 pounds, no matter her age and no matter her diet. Likelythe most famous waistline since Scarlett O’Hara’s; according to playwrightAnita Loos, Audrey’s hat size of 21 inches was wider than her waist, and to

prove just how slim Audrey remained, a friend once used Audrey’s belt as acollar for her St. Bernard dog. It fit.

With a waistline that thin, the whispers began—and never really ceased:Was Audrey Hepburn anorexic? Claims to that effect were made by authorDiana Maychick in her 1993 biography Audrey Hepburn, but Maychick’sclaims of inside information garnered directly from Audrey were disputed byAudrey’s entire family, with Robert Wolders definitively stating: “Never,ever did Audrey speak with her.”

The answer to the question of Audrey’s anorexia? An emphatic no. Hermetabolism never did fully recover from the war years of near starvation, andshe suffered lifelong effects from the anemia, edema, and jaundice that hadensued. The war-induced malnutrition meant that her muscular developmenthad not proceeded in normal fashion, and nothing could ever fully repair thedamage.

Did she pay attention to what she ate? Yes. There were lots of vegetables,no desserts, and a sparing consumption of alcohol, but then again, that discip-lined approach to food is the norm for any dancer. She found pleasure in eat-ing; when visiting great friend Connie Wald in Los Angeles, dinner wouldconsist of “Audrey’s favorite: my chicken salad. Before dinner she’d haveher Scotch and a cigarette. She usually wanted a green apple for dessert, andshe loved chocolates.” Careful she was, savoring exactly one square ofchocolate as a treat at the end of meals, but such discipline never preventedher from appreciating her food. As summed up by Jeffrey Banks: “She wouldeat anything and everything, but she wouldn’t eat huge quantities of it.”

She enjoyed a well-cooked steak because in her own words: “When youhave had the strength to survive starvation, you never again send back a steaksimply because it’s under-done.” Speaking of family meals Audrey sharedwith her two sons, Sean laughed: “She could eat us both under the table!”

The issue of her weight and how much she ate was simply not somethingshe dwelt upon at length. In Sean’s view, his mother wasn’t even overlyskinny; her upper body, “especially her thoracic cage” was thinner than nor-mal, leading to her noticeably slender waist, but ballet had made her arms andlegs athletic. It was simply her upper body that was skinny, what Audrey her-self took to calling “fake thin.”

Added to the years of malnutrition was the matter of genetics, withAudrey claiming that she possessed the same figure as her paternal grand-

mother. She seemed unable to gain weight even when she drank beer for justthat purpose—and her willowy body would have been enough for others todespise her, if only she weren’t so consistently, genuinely nice . . .

It was decidedly a model’s body, perfectly structured for all of thoseworld-famous designer clothes. Acres of print have been spilled overAudrey’s work with Givenchy, but it was their mutual attraction to cleanlines that made the partnership work so beautifully. Like the greatest artists—and Audrey undisputedly proved an artist with clothes—she and Givenchystripped away everything extraneous in a search for the truth: the clothesshould not draw attention to themselves but instead flatter the woman wear-ing them.

To wit: The Breakfast at Tiffany’s little black dress with a neckline thatplunged in the back, not the front. Accessorized with oversized Oliver Gold-smith tortoiseshell sunglasses and streaked highlights. A pearl-and-diamantenecklace with matching tiara completed the look, proving that what looked detrop on anyone else looked effortlessly chic on Audrey.

Like Astaire when he danced, she made the clothes and movement appeareffortless, a result achieved after endless practice and consideration. Theamount of such practice always proved extraordinary; Hubert would visitwith highlights from his latest couture collections, Audrey would try on thedresses—and then the real work would commence. This was not a case ofAudrey standing in front of the mirror and pronouncing yea or nay. Shewould instead slip on the dress and then proceed to sit, walk, and turn, fullyassessing both the look of the fabric and how the clothes lay on her body asshe moved. Said Hubert: “The underthings, the shoes, the hats, the gloves orwhatever else she wore with them—once she worked out the mechanics, shewas happy. Sometimes this took ten minutes, sometimes ten hours.” Her ap-proach filled the designer with admiration: “She was so disciplined, so organ-ized, she never was once late for a fitting.”

In the early 1960s, when men and women still made an effort at dressingup, Audrey planned her wardrobe with meticulous care: “I prepare a clotheschart for the coming seasons, just as I do when handed a script of a newmovie. I start writing down all the things I have and then eliminating the onesI feel I’ve worn out or are outdated.”

Women gravitated toward the fashions Audrey wore onscreen and off, yetshe was the first to in effect state: “Don’t compare yourself to me or anyone

else. . . . Focus on being yourself.” The starting point of that focus was al-ways an acute self-awareness of both assets and flaws: “You have to look atyourself objectively. Analyze yourself like an instrument. You have to be ab-solutely frank with yourself. Face your handicaps, don’t try to hide them. In-stead develop something else.”

And develop something else she did, exerting an influence upon fashionnever equaled by another Hollywood star. Combining a style impervious totrends with an utterly unique point of view, Audrey Hepburn dressed toplease herself. Says Sean: “Elegance starts within. If you don’t design or cul-tivate your mind there are no clothes that are going to help that. You’re goingto make a mistake at some point. My mother knew what worked for her andfelt comfortable with her very personal choices. She used to say, ‘I dressmore like an English gentleman than a woman.’ When she found the lookthat worked for her—for instance hacking jackets—she stuck with it for therest of her life. If you look at her in any decade it’s the same cut and look. It’san extension of who she was.”

Which in effect led to How to Dress for Success, Audrey Hepburn style:

# Clothes for Comfort:

Men’s shirts tied around the waist, usually at the side, not the front

Fitted tops

Chinos

Lacoste shirts

Headscarves tied under the chin

Headscarves worn as bandanas

# Shoes:

Ballet flats as everyday footwear

If ballet flats would have looked like an affectation on others, on Audrey theyworked precisely because she had studied ballet for years, and people knewit. The first public figure to wear ballet slippers in public, Audrey wore theshoes not only to remember her first dream of dancing but also as a verypractical reminder to pay attention to her walk.

Heels—minimum height kitten heels. Audrey did not want to add to her 5-foot, 7-inch frame.

If not small heels, then loafers. The key was comfortable shoes capable of

completing a properly stylized look, especially when worn with capri pants.Said Pamela Fiori: “Casually dressed in capri pants and ballet flats, Audreylooked more elegant than anyone else all dressed up.”

# Accessories:

Baskets serving as a purse

Oversized sunglasses—a must, not just as shield and disguise, but becausethe frames helped to round out what she considered to be her square face.Confiding in Doris Brynner, Audrey explained that she had “‘truly smalleyes.’ Her legendary wide-eyed look, she told her friend, ‘was only a trick ofmakeup carried out expressly for the camera.’”

# The Art of Minimalism:

Jewelry—Very little. Oval drop earrings often sufficed. “I like to wearvery little jewelry. . . . It should never look as if the woman is wearing itto show off that she has it. I like jewelry best after 6 p.m.”

For serious jewelry, the choice was pearls—either pearl earrings or the pearlnecklace that was a gift from then husband Mel. Pearls, unlike the watchesshe deemed “cold,” were “warm.”

# Makeup:

Just enough to bring attention to her cheekbones and silhouette

A hint of eyeliner on the top of the eye; completing the look: pale-coloredlipstick

# Fashion Don’ts :

No belts—unless specifically worn to accent dresses.

Wristwatches—never. An avoidance of cold metal or weight against herskin.

# Hiding One’s Flaws:

Tops with boatnecks. There was no better way, she felt, to divert attentionaway from her protruding collarbone.

No padded or squared shoulders: “I often cheat on my armholes and col-lars to give an illusion of narrow rather than wide shoulders.”

# Safety with Colors:

Black and white, beige, soft pinks, or greens—those were the colors of

choice: “My coloring lacks definition. Bright colors overpower me andwash me out . . . beige or black . . . will look right at almost any hour ofthe day or evening and in almost any weather. . . . I have only black orbeige shoes and bags and wear only white three-quarter length gloves.”

# A Mixture of High Fashion with Practicality:

A 1963 article on her worldwide fashion influence found her in the midstof buying a reversible poplin parka: olive green on one side and white onthe other, complete with a hood and drawstring waistline for “walking themountains.” To be sure, not many in her audience spent great swaths oftime walking the mountains, but of the reversible coat’s appeal there wasno doubt.

# Stick with What You Know and Like:

When it came time for a new raincoat, Audrey asked Givenchy to makeher a new coat, but only if lined with the same mink she had worn for tenyears under another raincoat. She liked the fur out of sight, worn for com-fort rather than to impress. Besides, “It sounds terribly snobby, but fur ismuch warmer when it is against you.”

# Four Rules for the Hepburn Look:

1. Look for simplicity of line—aim for timeless, rather than thelatest trend.

2. Buy quality rather than quantity.

3. Wear sports clothes that look lived-in rather than brand-new.The Fred Astaire approach to clothes.

4. Wear the right outfit at the right time. In other words—planahead.

# The Art of Aging Gracefully:

As the years passed, her methods and preparation were pared down to theessentials because the prospect of aging held no fear. Growing older was,she felt, the most natural of processes, and a part of life to be enjoyed andtreated with respect. To wit:

Hair Care—Why color her hair? As Audrey aged and some of her chest-

nut hair turned gray, she let it be, simply pulling it back in a ponytail.The naturally graying hair and minimalist makeup seemed only to add toher beauty, the lack of artifice emphasizing her bone structure andcheekbones.

Eyebrows—Without resorting to artificial means, she felt one shouldsimply adjust to advancing age through small, meaningful changes. Hav-ing started with heavy dark brows, as the decades passed Audrey modi-fied her eyebrows to appear lighter in color and thickness.

Beauty Regimen—Virtually nonexistent. Shampoo from Philip Kings-ley. Makeup courtesy of Dr. Ernő László’s skin protective products. Endof regimen.

Cosmetic Surgery. Audrey never did have a facelift, but saw “nothingwrong with that, either for an actress or any woman who feels she needsit.” Said Sean in an interview with the Mail Online after her death: “Mymother thought everybody should be allowed to make their own choicesand be allowed to feel more beautiful. I don’t know if she would havehad surgery herself, but maybe, and in her general style it would havebeen minor.”

For all the acclaim directed her way as a fashion idol par excellence, her self-assessment remained humorously modest: “Put me in furs and jewels and Ilook like something off a barrel organ. I’m much happier in my favorite cos-tume: tight red slacks and a pink Brooks shirt.”

Explained Robert Wolders: “[She was] almost like a child in that she re-fused to believe how good she looked. She was extraordinarily modest . . .and it wasn’t a kind of false modesty.”

Ultimately, it never really was about high fashion or makeup, because inthe words of Audrey’s favorite essay, Sam Levenson’s “Time Tested BeautyTips,” which she herself adapted into a poem:

The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that shecarries, or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is thedoorway to her heart, the place where love resides.

# Chapter Thirty-ThreeONCE MORE WITH FEELING, 1966

“As a child I was taught that it was bad manners to bring attention to your-self, and never, ever make a spectacle of yourself. . . . All of which I’veearned a living doing.

” —Audrey Hepburn

WITH AUDREY’S FASHION INFLUENCE AT an all-time high after the triumphs ofCharade and My Fair Lady, Hollywood now fell back on its default “creat-ive” position: if a film works, repeat the formula with the fewest possiblevariations. In other words, when in doubt pair Audrey Hepburn with Parisand Hubert de Givenchy. Sabrina, Funny Face, Charade—the Hepburn-Pariscombination couldn’t be beat. Forget about Paris When It Sizzles—that wasthe exception that proved the rule. Instead, let Audrey reunite not just withParis but also with Givenchy and director William Wyler. The vehicle?1966’s whimsical How to Steal a Million (original title: Venus Rising). As itturned out, not much went wrong, but then again, not much went particularlyright either.

The “might-as-well-keep-busy-and-have-a-few-laughs” air which per-vades the film seemed to have originated with Wyler’s own shrugging ac-ceptance of the assignment. In later years Wyler’s wife Talli explained:“Willy took that picture at that moment because he didn’t have anything bet-ter to do. . . . He took it because of his longtime friendship with Zanuck andbecause he felt he ought to do another movie.” His shrugging acceptance ofthe assignment was reflected in the casting of Audrey herself; in conversationwith his longtime editor Robert Swink, Wyler allowed that he deliberatelyasked for Audrey because he was sure Richard Zanuck would be unable tosecure her as the film’s star.

But secure her he did, and with Audrey on board, everyone proceededwith at least a degree of enthusiasm. On paper, the screenplay by Harry Kur-nitz seemed promising, even if reminiscent of snippets of Charade and Sab-rina; this time around, the story line would reverse the My Fair Lady trans-formation, with Audrey (“Nicole Bonnet”) starting out wealthy before mas-querading as a cleaning lady in order to pull off a successful museum heist.Nicole’s partner in crime, handsome, charming “Simon Dermot,” would beplayed by handsome, charming Peter O’Toole. Old friend and esteemed col-league Charles Lang would provide the cinematography, and Givenchy thewardrobe. Wyler, Lang, O’Toole, Paris, Givenchy: the omens for success allseemed to be in place.

In fact, O’Toole and Audrey did thoroughly enjoy each other’s companyon set, and although O’Toole, who was three years younger than Audrey, felta bit intimidated by her “stern and formidable” façade, he developed a bit of acrush, even while perceptively noting the underlying layer of disappointmentthat seemed to cling to his co-star, no matter how strenuous her efforts tobanish it through laughter: “There was a modesty and a sadness about her.”Doffing his hat to Audrey, O’Toole admiringly stated: “She was the one—and I think only—actor who could soften [Wyler’s] resolve.”

As it turned out, the film’s premise of a daring heist was mirrored in reallife, when five robbers tied up the movie studio’s concierge on a Saturdaymorning, cracked the safe, and escaped with the following week’s $\$ 20,000$payroll. The crime was never solved, and that offscreen problem was soonmirrored on set by difficulties that centered around the role of wealthy Amer-ican art collector “Davis Leland.” Wyler’s first choice, Walter Matthau, hadpriced himself out of the supporting role by demanding $\$ 200,000$ —twice thestudio’s offer—as well as above-the-title billing. Turning next to George C.Scott, Wyler was pleased to begin filming with the talented if temperamentalaward winner. Within the first week of filming, however, Scott’s drinkingcaused delays in production, and Wyler fired Scott, replacing him with de-pendable veteran Eli Wallach. (Like Scott, O’Toole himself was also knownto imbibe frequently, but he never caused delays in filming, and Wyler grewfond of the actor. Said Talli Wyler: “He knew his lines and knew what hewas doing. Willy was even more impressed by his abilities.”)

There were two additional members of the production team who alsoseemed to function as Audrey’s co-stars: Hubert de Givenchy and production

designer Alexandre Trauner. With Wyler unable to film in an actual museumfor fear the crew would damage priceless paintings, Trauner, who by nowhad won an Academy Award for Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, created astunningly accurate depiction of an art museum and then hired seven painters,at a total cost of $\$ 100,000$ , to forge Monets, Goyas, Van Goghs, and Picassos.

But even more eye-catching than the paintings was Audrey’s Givenchy-designed wardrobe. Her look was now changing: patterned tights, shorterskirts, and oversized bubble sunglasses dominated her onscreen appearance,and there was a different hairstyle featured as well, a layered beehive withsideburns, bouffant on top with bangs set to one side. Audrey was sporting agreat deal more eyeliner than usual, and while this head-to-toe remake wasstriking on its own terms, it ultimately seemed like the filmmakers’ attempt tokeep up with the groovy 1960s.

At times the entire movie feels like one long parade of clothes, beginningwith Audrey’s first appearance in a “mod” hat and oversized sunglasses. Pas-tel outfits accessorized with belts, diamond earrings, sequined eyeliner andeven a drop-dead black dress accented by a see-through mask all made an ap-pearance. When plot machinations found O’Toole trying to steal art from theapartment Nicole shares with her art forger father Charles (Hugh Griffith),Audrey is seen swanning about in a pink nightgown under a shocking pink,perfectly tailored coat. It’s an outfit which encapsulates the inherent imbal-ance found in the film: the viewer’s attention is held far more by the extra-vagant wardrobe than it is by the silly and sometimes forced shenanigansplaying out onscreen. The film was to prove Audrey’s last notable onscreenpairing with Givenchy, with the outfits he was to design for Bloodline and thetelevision movie Love Among Thieves playing out more like “guest appear-ance by Hubert de Givenchy” than as essential parts of the Hepburn-Givenchy filmography.

The collaboration between star and designer had unquestionably elevatedboth of their careers and resulted in an achievement that has survived thechanging fashions and whims of the past half century. At their most dazzling,in Sabrina, Funny Face, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and Charade, Givenchy andAudrey inspired each other to extraordinary heights. By the time of How toSteal a Million (1966), however, Hollywood was changing. The studio sys-tem was crumbling, and expensive, elaborate wardrobes seemed a thing ofthe past—couture creations in an off-the-rack world.

By now, so well-known had the collaboration between Audrey andGivenchy become that Hubert’s name even supplied one of How to Steal aMillion’s punchlines; hiding in the museum closet, Nicole/Audrey changesinto her cleaning lady clothes in order to pull off the heist. Studying Audrey’sdrab washerwoman garb closely, Peter O’Toole suddenly exclaims: “Thatdoes it!”

“What?”

“Well, it gives Givenchy the night off.”

It’s a mildly amusing line but suffers from being uttered during a wildlyoverlong sequence which finds Nicole and Simon crammed into a tiny closet.The budding romance between the duo within the confines of the close quar-ters should have made for a humorous ratcheting up of suspense and sexualtension a la Joel McCrea’s and Jean Arthur’s sensual bantering on the room-ing house steps in 1943’s The More the Merrier; instead, an inherently hu-morous situation grows flabby when stretched to twice its proper runningtime. That overlong running time is even reflected in the rather obtrusiveJohnny Williams score, which thunders along during a Keystone Cops–likefinale overstuffed with security guards running amok through the museum.

Yes, Audrey’s sense of timing remained impeccable, as displayed by herresponse to the question: “Did this ruffian molest you in any way?” Ponder-ing the question, she answers with a perfectly calibrated “Not much,” a two-word line reading which tells you that this woman can take excellent care ofherself, thank you very much. Hepburn and O’Toole spar nicely, and theycertainly make for a great-looking couple. The film even includes a nicelyjudged in-joke which shows Audrey/Nicole in bed reading a magazine aboutAlfred Hitchcock, a knowing reference to the aborted Hitchcock-Hepburncollaboration on No Time for the Jury.

But in the end, Wyler seems nothing so much as stymied by the material,and it all lends a feeling of inevitability to the fact that after How to Steal aMillion he directed only two more films: Funny Girl (1968) and The Libera-tion of LB Jones (1970). Reviews were mixed, but even though the New YorkTimes’s Bosley Crowther smilingly termed it a “wholly ingratiating film thatshould leave everyone who sees it feeling kindlier about deceit,” the filmfeels like a ten-years-later version of Love in the Afternoon. With its glossylook and reliance upon the charm of two larger-than-life stars, How to Steal aMillion seems a relic from the late 1950s rather than a release aimed at the in-

creasingly permissive marketplace found at the time of its July 1966premiere. Still, it scored at the box office, grossing a very solid $\$ 10$ millionand causing producer Fred Kohlmar to smilingly proclaim: “If every picturethat Fox made came out like that, there would never be anything to worryabout.”

It’s a frustrating film to watch because it promises so much more than itdelivers. But if the end product did nothing to particularly advance Audrey’scareer, it soon didn’t matter, because Audrey Hepburn was about to givewhat is, along with her portrayal of Sister Luke in The Nun’s Story, the finestperformance of her entire career.

Two for the Road. A movie about a complicated marriage. A movie that,even with her marriage to Mel Ferrer in trouble, she made in part becauseMel urged her to do so.

He always did give her valuable career advice.

Director Stanley Donen thought Givenchy would not be appropriate for Audrey’s charac-ter in Two for the Road. Instead, Audrey’s wardrobe was supervised by Clare Rendle-sham, with specific items designed by Ken Scott, Michele Rosier, Mary Quant, and Foale& Tuffin.

# Chapter Thirty-FourTWO FOR THE ROAD, 1967

“Donen and his associates . . . make ‘Two for the Road’ two things: a Hol-lywood-style romance between beautiful people, and an honest story aboutrecognizable human beings. I’d call it ‘A Man and a Woman’ for grown-ups.”

—Roger Ebert

WHEN FREDERIC RAPHAEL, FRESH FROM winning an Academy Award for Darling(1965), showed Stanley Donen his new, original screenplay charting the upsand downs of a married couple over the course of twelve years, the directorhad two immediate reactions: (1) He insisted upon directing the film. (2) Hequickly called Audrey, saying “I’m sending you a treatment.” Audrey’s ini-tial reaction upon reading the treatment: “It’s too complicated.” Donen, un-daunted, simply replied: “You have to make this film.”

Off Donen and Raphael flew to Switzerland to plead their case directly.After further consideration, Audrey said: “I’ll do it. It’s wonderful. I waswrong.” Raphael recalled Audrey as “gracious, entirely sweet, and unassum-ing,” but her marriage was encountering difficulties at the time, and he foundMel Ferrer to be a “one-hundred percent pain in the ass, very boring.” Unsur-prisingly, Mel’s account of their meeting reads very differently: “Audrey usu-ally makes up her own mind about what she’s going to do, but when I readthe script of Two for the Road, I told her to make it—right away.”

In Raphael’s architecturally complex script, every scene of the film findsMark and Joanna Wallace on holiday, with the cars in which they journey es-sentially becoming their homes. These multiple holidays unfold over thecourse of twelve years, and by eschewing chronological storytelling, thescreenplay is able to jump back and forth in time to reveal the entire story of

a marriage: a scene detailing the unraveling of the Wallaces’ partnership isfollowed by a painful reconciliation, only to then flash back to the beginningof the couple’s relationship. The concept, in Raphael’s words, sprang fromhis idea of how strange it would be to drive and “overtake ourselves—passour old selves on the road and look back and see how the people we werethen had become the people we are now.”

A tentative deal for production and distribution was set up at Universal,but the studio soon pulled out, their skittishness echoed in the negative reac-tion from all of the other majors: the storytelling, they all felt, was just toocomplicated for American audiences. With none of the major Hollywood stu-dios willing to bankroll the film, it remained stalled until the producing teamof Richard Zanuck and David Brown expressed interest. Then just startingout on a partnership which would peak with The Sting (1973) and Jaws(1975), Zanuck and Brown forged a production and distribution deal with20th Century Fox, and the film was greenlit.

With Audrey having signaled her willingness to star, the biggest castingdecision now lay in finding the right actor to play Mark, Joanna’s successfularchitect husband. Who possessed the necessary charisma and masculine ap-peal that would render Joanna’s decision to stay with the oft-times unpleasantMark understandable? Donen’s first choice, Paul Newman, was not inter-ested, and Michael Caine proved to be unavailable (when asked in later yearsif there were any roles that he wished he had played, Caine instantly replied“Yes, the Albert Finney role with Audrey Hepburn in Two for the Road”).

With Caine out of the picture, the name of Albert Finney was mentionedand then mentioned again. Hot off the Academy Award–winning TomJones (1963), as well as Night Must Fall (1964), Finney possessed an earthysex appeal based upon a rugged masculinity that was laced with humor. Alunch meeting with Audrey was arranged in Paris, where Finney, for reasonsbest known to himself, decided to impersonate a homosexual interior decor-ator, complete with highly effeminate mannerisms. Said Donen: “The entirelunch Audrey’s jaw kept dropping and she’d be looking at me, her eyesgrowing larger by the minute and she never saying a word, although obvi-ously thinking: how ever am I going to play a love story with this man?” Theruse was dropped, a relieved Audrey laughed, and an instant friendship wasformed.

The old, manicured style of dress favored by golden age Hollywood act-resses was giving way to the more natural look of Julie Christie, JacquelineBisset, and Jeanne Moreau, and Audrey’s role in Two for the Road nowprovided her with a chance to bridge the two worlds. Which meant—noGivenchy. Which also meant that her comfort zone—the clothes that gave herboth a sense of protection and “a confidence I don’t have on my own”—would be missing. Difficult as it was for Audrey to tell Hubert that shecouldn’t use him for the film, she knew the script demanded just such achange. (Ever loyal, shortly before the film’s premiere, she pointedly noted:“I buy just as many things from Hubert as ever . . . my couture things arehis.”)

Off-the-rack clothes it would be, a new approach that found Audrey, Mel,and Donen shopping for two hours in Paris boutiques, browsing the racks un-til an exhausted Audrey told her husband and director: “You two knowwhat’s right for me, you do the shopping. I’ll try on whatever you bring me.But in a nice, comfortable hotel suite.”

Ninety outfits were purchased, with Audrey choosing twenty-nine for thefirst half of the film. Donen’s wife then suggested that Ken Scott, an Amer-ican who had set up shop in Rome, design clothes for the remaining portionof the film, and Audrey acquiesced to the choice, with the proviso that therebe “no bright colors, no prints.” Audrey spent two days in Milan trying ondozens of designs, but for Scott the collaboration proved difficult, and hecalled Audrey “extremely rigid” in her refusal to wear anything red. Exit KenScott, enter Lady Clare Rendlesham, who brought in seventy outfits forDonen’s and Audrey’s joint approval. Together, they selected miniskirts andswimsuits designed by both Mary Quant and Michele Rosier, “the ‘vinylgirl,’ who designed for the ready to wear French house of V de V.” Roundingout the international flavor of the wardrobe were outfits designed by Spanishdesigner Paco Rabanne, then working out of Paris.

Part and parcel of the contemporary wardrobe were the new hairstyleschosen to help define the more casual look of Audrey’s character. London ex-pert Patricia Thomas was flown to Paris, and with strong input from Audrey,a variety of hairstyles were designed to convey the twelve years covered bythe script. Less commented upon but just as noticeable was the change inAudrey’s eyebrows. Gone were the trademark thick dark brows and in theirplace a thinner, more subtle look, all designed by her trusted makeup artist

Alberto De Rossi: “Audrey’s eyebrows are twice as thin now as when shemade her first film. Then they were immense—but you never noticed how Ibrought them down, film by film. I’ve given her completely new eyes for thisfilm.”

Thin eyebrows. No couture glamour. A new Audrey playing a new type ofmodern, sexual woman.

In working with Albert Finney, Audrey would be playing opposite a muchyounger (seven years) leading man for the first time. Finney’s palpable mas-culinity relaxed Audrey, and the co-stars enjoyed each other’s company somuch that Audrey discarded her usual practice of keeping to herself on set.Donen was the first to note the marked difference in her behavior, contrastingthe Audrey of Two for the Road with the Audrey he had directed in FunnyFace and Charade: “She was so free, so happy. I never saw her like that. Soyoung!” Along with the ease came a contagious laughter, all of it underscor-ing Audrey’s own pronouncement: “I love people who make me laugh. It’sprobably the most important thing in a person.”

So well did Audrey get along with Finney that rumors of an affair quicklybegan. Seven years old at the time, Sean has memories of the filming: “I wason the set and my father came to visit—we have some lovely pictures fromthe south of France. But her relationship with my father was ending and shehad a fling with ‘Fin’ as everyone called him. She always said, ‘I stayed inmy marriage seventeen years but that was maybe too long.’ She overstayedbecause she so wanted it to work.”

Robert Wolders expressed the most nuanced perspective on what that newrelationship with Finney meant for Audrey: “Audrey cared for Finney a greatdeal. He represented a whole new freedom and closeness for her. It was thebeginning of a new period in her life.” Finney’s thoughts? “Performing withAudrey was quite disturbing, actually. Playing a love scene with a woman assexy as Audrey, you sometimes get to the edge where make believe and real-ity are blurred.” Novelist Irwin Shaw, on set for parts of the filming, approv-ingly noted: “She and Albie had this wonderful thing to see. They were like acouple of kids.”

Perhaps that sense of freedom resulted from the fact that with the notableexception of a studio set built for the raucous party scene near the end of themovie, the entire film was shot on locations throughout Europe. The realismof those locations was further matched by the true-to-life no-holds-barred dia-

logue, and audiences knew they were in for a different sort of ride as soon asthey heard the first lines of dialogue:

Joanna: They don’t look very happy.

Mark: Why should they? They just got married.

Tough, often bitchy dialogue received as much play as witty repartee, and forthe first time in her career, Audrey Hepburn was now playing a woman whodesired sex as much as romance.

The movie toggled back and forth in time, with one event nudging the filmbackward before it quickly flashed forward a full decade. Relationshipsstumbled along uncertain paths, with the younger versions of Mark andJoanna shadowed by their older selves. Movement proved constant becausedirector Donen wanted “a lot of dialogue and lots of moving at the same time.I wanted it to be different from real life but feel like real life.” In the words ofI Do and I Don’t, Jeanine Basinger’s definitive history of marriage in themovies, “By removing all transitions and indications of change and by juxta-posing time frames ironically, the movie speaks cinematically about whathappens in a marriage: as time passes, it gets edited and loses its originalframe of reference.”

With its winding back-and-forth temporal framework, Two for the Roadslowly made it clear that there was never going to be a turning point leadingto happily ever after land. Love scenes were juxtaposed against sequences ofAudrey and Finney swearing and throwing verbal darts at one another, eachset piece exposing raw nerve ends in its examination of how and when a mar-riage could spin off the tracks. Says Joanna: “You don’t give me everything Iwant . . . you give me everything you want to give me.”

Here was a movie not about the problems faced in getting married, but ofstaying married. Observed Donen: “Most of Audrey’s pictures were about theeuphoric feeling of falling in love. This was about the difficulties after thateuphoria.”

The deliberate, occasionally byzantine pacing built inexorably to one ofthe most powerful and unexpected scenes in the entire Hepburn filmography;when Joanna returns to her husband after having an affair with another man,husband Mark glances at her and very deliberately states: “Are you sure youremember which one I am?” It’s not just the unexpected cruelty of the scene

that lands, it’s the conflicting emotions that play across Hepburn’s face. An-ger, sadness, rueful self-recognition—they’re all silently displayed in a matterof seconds. It is no surprise, then, to learn that filming this adultery-centricsequence proved extremely difficult for Donen, Finney, and Hepburn alike.Commented the director: “All of us had things in our lives that it reminded usof, so we really suffered. When I look at it, I see extreme pain.”

But for the most part, so happy did Audrey feel on set that she even faceddown two of her lifelong fears: driving and being submerged in water. Eightyears earlier in Beverly Hills, Audrey had rented a car, and while trying toswerve around an oncoming vehicle had crashed into a parked car. Audreywas not hurt but Joan Lora, a twenty-two-year-old actress and dancer, was in-jured. Claiming neck and back injuries because of the accident, she filed suitagainst Audrey for $\$ 45,000$ in lost earnings. Audrey eventually paid only tenpercent of that total but vowed never to drive again. Now, perhaps encour-aged by the controlled conditions of a film set, she undertook sequenceswhich found her behind the wheel of a car, successfully completing all of thedriving without a hitch.

Of more import, however, was her willingness to confront her phobiaabout being pushed underwater. The scene in question called for Joanna to bethrown into a pool, and given Audrey’s lifelong fear of the water, Donen re-assured her that two assistant directors would be standing just out of camerarange, poised to quickly snatch her out of the water. Cameras rolled, the ac-tion was captured to Donen’s satisfaction, and he happily yelled “Cut!”—atwhich point he realized that in the rush to protect Audrey, one of the assistantdirectors had inadvertently stepped into the shot. With the sequence needingto be completely reshot, Audrey’s hair had to be dried, her wardrobe repur-posed, and the cameras reset, until, with tension growing by the minute, sheprepared herself for another dunking. Donen yelled “Action!” Audrey steeledherself and this time the scene was captured perfectly. Said Donen: “It wasvery courageous of her to do it. Twice.”

Finney and Hepburn’s mutual regard continued to deepen with the passingweeks, as did their ease in playing off each other. Said Donen: “They workedwell as a team. They both loved the parts. They were serious actors whoworked hard.” Donen’s was a point well taken; Audrey’s onscreen charm wassuch that people often failed to realize just how hard she worked at her craft.Said screenwriter Raphael: “I remember hearing her give Stanley eight differ-

ent readings of the words ‘Hello, darling.’ Number six, she thought, was theright one. Always needed to be perfect, that was Audrey.”

Shooting completed, Donen grew particularly anxious to hear not just theHenry Mancini score but especially the title tune he was writing with long-time collaborator Johnny Mercer. Into his studio Mancini disappeared, even-tually emerging with a theme he thought fit the tone of the picture beautifully.Donen’s reaction? “I don’t think it’s right for the movie.” A disappointedMancini returned one week later with a new and haunting theme, the lyricsby Mercer dovetailing perfectly with the pensive melody.

The song’s bittersweet mix of melancholy sound and wondering lyricmatched the finished film because, as Mancini explained: “If you listen tothose songs—(‘Moon River,’ ‘Charade,’ ‘Two for the Road’)—you can al-most tell who inspired them, because they all have Audrey’s quality of wist-fulness—a kind of slight sadness.” Mancini, an individual of great sensitivity,had caught the subtext of Audrey’s persona: underneath the beautiful and gra-cious exterior lay an understanding of exactly how difficult life could be,with moments of beauty running headlong into acres of hurt. In the words ofnovelist Pat Conroy (The Prince of Tides), who spent a lifetime mining hisown often tormented personal life in search of emotional truth: “Love had al-ways issued out of the places that hurt the most.”

Entering the editing room with Madeleine Gug and Richard Marden,Donen brought with him more footage than he had on any of his previousnineteen films. It all represented a deliberate choice, one that fit the rollercoaster of emotions expressed by both husband and wife in the film: “Onearlier pictures I camera cut the film—there was virtually no film left overafter editing. Here, I shot so that I had a choice of who to focus in on.”

What he now encountered in the editing room was an actress possessed ofnot just native talent but also extraordinary skill: “The role required a depthof emotion, care, yearning and maturity that Audrey had never played be-fore.” This, Donen felt, was the performance of Audrey’s career. The naïveyoung Joanna in a red jersey is a very different woman from the hardenedsophisticate in the flashy but cold metal dress found at film’s end, and yet theprogression makes sense. Audrey’s control over her characterization re-mained total.

Whether imitating a traffic signal by wildly rotating her arms, impersonat-ing the sounds of sheep and chickens, or even grappling with a recalcitrant

faucet, there was a freedom about Audrey’s performance that signaled a newlevel of skill in her acting. At age thirty-seven she was digging deeper within,exposing herself emotionally in an unprecedented manner by drawing uponher complicated feelings about the end of her own marriage. Meeting everychallenge head-on, she appeared completely at home throughout a comicallydisturbing film which ends with husband and wife looking at each other andmurmuring, “Bitch,” “Bastard.” Mark and Joanna will be staying together—but for how long is anyone’s guess. Audrey, it was clear, had traveled a verygreat distance from the fairy tale land of Sabrina into the real-life landscapeof twentieth-century marriage. Says Jeanine Basinger: “It really is one of thegreatest, most fully realized, three dimensional portraits of a married womanever put on film.” A rare take on marriage in the Hollywood of 1967, Two forthe Road would remain anomalous in the same way as does 2019’s MarriageStory—as an unflinchingly intimate depiction of the realities of marriage.

Perhaps it had been Audrey’s charm of manner, or the fact that she was abeautiful clotheshorse with a gift for light comedy, that had led to her havingbeen underrated as an actress, but this time around, even the critics seemedfavorably disposed, with Judith Crist describing a “new (mod and non-Givenchy) Audrey Hepburn displaying her too-long-neglected depths andscope as an actress . . .” Raved Variety: “Helped partially by variations in herhairdos but mostly by her facial expressions, she’s completely believable,lovable and totally delightful.”

The film proved a moderate box office success in the United States, but abigger hit overseas. Part of the limited appeal for American audiences mayhave resulted from every American in the movie proving obnoxious in theextreme, from an overbearing guest at the final cocktail party to the mother,father, and little girl with whom Joanna and Mark travel for part of the film.The young girl, in fact, is the most unpleasant child glimpsed onscreen since,well, The Children’s Hour.

Yes, the film is a little too self-consciously hip, and the mod late ’60sclothes insist on drawing attention to themselves, but even when wearing theeye-catching metal dress near film’s end, Audrey dominates it, wearing it inservice to Joanna and the brittle, wounded survivor she has become. InAudrey’s hands, Joanna remains a recognizably complicated woman ofcharm and battered strength, but the reaction to Finney’s occasionally gratingcharacter proves a bit more complicated. Do all architects yell so incessantly?

Whether that character trait is present in Raphael’s screenplay or is simplyhow Finney approached the character is hard to discern, but even directorDonen subsequently admitted: “It came out a little one-sided, like he’s a shit,and he wasn’t supposed to be.”

Screenwriter Raphael termed the experience of making the film “sublime,”and although he lost the Best Screenplay Oscar to William Rose’s top-heavyscript for Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, audiences ultimately accepted thefinished film precisely because of the story’s very complexity. Here was amarried couple who laughed and then cried over their relationship, only to ul-timately embrace it even while sometimes hating it. In other words, this wasmarriage in all its recognizable and universal contradictions.

Donen himself summed up the film’s multilayered approach in accurate,rather gimlet-eyed terms: “This isn’t happily ever after. The movie says thisis how they loved ever after. Neither one is completely happy or sad. It’s theclosest we could get to the way marriages survive. They have grown to-gether.” It is more than likely that Two for the Road’s moderate returns at thebox office resulted precisely because of this realistic view; die-hard Audreyfans preferred their heroine as the perennially beautiful princess movinggracefully through life toward a happily-ever-after ending. But in breakingthat template, in digging deep to limn the essence of a woman not so very dif-ferent from herself and millions of others, Audrey had provided audienceswith a welcome look at her own artistic maturity.

Two for the Road proved to be the last hit of Donen’s feature film career,the next four decades filled mostly with television work and feature-lengthmisfires like Lucky Lady (1975). Audrey herself, by now the veteran of athree-film, ten-year collaboration with Donen, provided an interesting,thoughtful analysis of his filmography: “Stanley had his career when he wasa young man. Perhaps careers really can only last a certain amount of time . .”

With this statement, was Audrey also ruminating about her own career?As it developed, in the twenty-six years between Two for the Road and herown untimely death, she was to appear in only seven more films, includingone cameo (Always), one talking head appearance (Directed by WilliamWyler), and one television movie (Love Among Thieves). The best of thoseadditional seven films, Wait Until Dark, was released a mere six months afterTwo for the Road.

Audrey Hepburn had, with Two for the Road, banished all talk of the per-ennial ingénue, her remarkable talent and long-lasting appeal nowhere bettersummed up than by the words spoken early in the film, after Joanna andMark make love for the first time:

Mark: Who are you?

Joanna: Some girl.

That she was.

# Chapter Thirty-FiveALONE IN THE DARK, 1967–1968

“When the lights go out at the end of the film, so did the lights in themovie theaters. Terence Young’s tense cinematic adaptation so ruthlesslytightens the screws of tension that one could be forgiven for not noticingan earthquake, much less dimmed house lights.”

—Slant Magazine

IN THEIR BY NOW ALMOST desperate determination to stay together,Audrey and Mel decided upon one final joint venture, a film version of theBroadway thriller Wait Until Dark, to be produced by Mel and star Audrey.The story of a blind woman terrorized by murderous thugs who are after adrug-filled doll she doesn’t even know she possesses was a far cry from theworld of Funny Face, and that was, in fact, part of the allure. Disappointedshe may have been by the unraveling of her marriage, but Audrey still recog-nized the possibilities inherent in Wait Until Dark, and at Mel’s urging shesaid yes. Together again on a film set for one last time.

A hit play on Broadway written by Frederick Knott and starring Lee Re-mick, Wait Until Dark (1966) had been bought by Warner Bros. as a vehiclefor Audrey for the princely sum of $1 million. Although the film was not tobe released until 1967, negotiations for the rights had actually begun in 1965,before the play had even officially opened. In Mel’s recall, Audrey knew assoon as she read the script that she wanted to play the role of Susy Hendrix:blind and vulnerable yet strong and determined, Susy outwits a psychopathicmurderer through guts and brains. Here was material that represented achance for Audrey to expand her range.

After Warner Bros. finalized the deal for the rights, agent Kurt Frings wasable to land Audrey a top-of-the-line deal: in addition to veto power over her

director, Audrey would receive a salary of $\$ 900,000$ , a percentage of thegross, and per diem of $1,000 per week throughout shooting.

Mel’s salary as producer was fixed at $\$ 50,000$ , and it was at Mel’s recom-mendation that Audrey’s old friend Terence Young was tapped to direct. Anextremely hot property after directing the James Bond hits Dr. No (1962) andFrom Russia with Love (1963), Young knew Audrey not only from the worldof movies but also because twenty-three years earlier, as a young British sol-dier, he had been wounded at the Battle of Arnhem and Audrey and Ella hadhelped take care of him. Audrey’s delight at working with Young washeightened by the knowledge that Charles Lang, the cinematographer on Sab-rina, had signed on as the director of photography. With Mel, Terence, andCharles, she would be surrounded by a team with whom she felt comfortableand protected.

During preproduction, Young asked that Audrey wear contact lenses tosuggest the character’s blindness, but Audrey thought they would make herface appear too rigid, and instead decided that she would study at the NewYork City Lighthouse for the Blind. By immersing herself in the environmentof the Lighthouse, she learned the elemental lessons acquired by blind peopleliving in a sighted world: How to navigate by sense of touch. The best meansby which to differentiate sounds and textures. The way in which to use a spe-cial telephone. She soon met a young sightless woman at the Lighthousewhom she called “a blessing. . . . I said, ‘Do something for me, find your wayaround this room.’ And I sat on my chair and just watched her. She had beau-tiful eyes, dark shiny eyes. There was no way of knowing that she couldn’tsee.”

To Audrey, the use of contacts or dark glasses would “draw attention tothe fact that I am not blind. My hope was to do it from the inside out. Tosomehow convince the audience—for a fleeting moment—that I could createan illusion of blindness . . .” It was to Sean a prime example of his mother’sacting ability: “She stayed very instinctive in terms of accessing her emotionsfor the role, and yet she would also fully prepare.”

Like the play, the film would take place almost entirely in Susy Hendrix’sapartment, and given the stripped-down nature of the production, there wouldbe no Givenchy-designed wardrobe. Throughout the film’s nearly two-hourrunning time, Audrey would be seen in only two outfits, both of them consist-ing of slacks and turtleneck, and the final cut of the film would contain no

credit for costume design.

Alan Arkin, cast as the psychopathic “Roat” who terrorizes Susy, hadmade an initial splash in the previous year’s The Russians Are Coming, TheRussians Are Coming, but playing a killer was a new step for the then thirty-three-year-old actor: “I was coming out of a rough period in Chicago—I hadmet low lifes and I had seen drug addicts. It all influenced me in my approachto the role and I don’t think either the director, Terence Young, or the produ-cer ‘got’ what I was doing—until the moment I pulled out the knife. I waslike a snake in hiding and all of a sudden it all clicked into place—people sawwhat I was after.”

Arkin may have been playing a psychopath, but his memory of the filmcenters around Audrey’s genteel insistence that the crew break for tea everyafternoon: “An umbrella would be placed outside the set with nice chairs anda table, and five or six of us would sit around and talk. I was almost embar-rassed because I hated being cruel to Audrey, hated playing such an awfulcharacter. It caused me to keep to myself a bit on set, but I would always sitfor tea!”

Reflecting decades later about his time with Audrey, Arkin explained:“She had a regality about her but was utterly unaffected. Terrific to workwith. Nothing about her demanded that anyone treat her in a special way, andshe was never aloof. She was right in there, every day, making this scaryfilm. In an odd way I think a problem throughout her career was that it wasdifficult to lower herself to play the characters she was assigned because herown character was so impeccable. Some think of this as a flaw, but I thoughtit was an asset. It was like working with royalty.”

When Young and editor Gene Milford previewed a rough cut for theWarner Bros. brass, all assembled felt they had the makings of a major boxoffice hit, and an extremely effective two-pronged marketing ploy washatched: All print ads would carry the creepily effective taglines “The blindsmoving up and down . . . the squeaking shoes . . . and then the knife whistlingpast her ear.” In addition, advertisements would also carry the warning thatall lights in the theatre would be shut off during the climactic fifteen minutes,the better to heighten the sense of audience dread while Roat stalks Susy.This lights-out approach did in fact work brilliantly; in the climactic momentsof the film, after Susy smashes all of the lights in her apartment so that herbattle with Roat can be joined on equal ground, the injured Roat leaps out of

the dark to kill her. Sitting in pitch-black theatres, audiences around theworld never failed to scream.

Said Arkin fifty years after the film’s premiere: “At the time I certainlyhad no idea we were making such a good film. You don’t think that way dur-ing the process of making the movie, you don’t think of being great. I justwanted to complete the work. But it’s a film that really is first rate. It was ba-sically one set, with the addition of the airport scene and one in the parkinglot, but even with ninety percent of the film taking place in the apartment, itnever feels like a stage play or like the camera is plopped in the fifth-rowcenter.

“The funny thing is that Terence Young, the director, always seemed to beon the phone more than he was on the set! I felt he was not particularly pay-ing attention, that he just wanted to get on with it. He always seemed to betalking with his agent or with his wife, so I’m kind of astonished at how wellit turned out. I’ve seen it a couple of times in the years since we made it andI’m actually enormously impressed by how well made it is.”

So effective was Arkin’s malevolence that it allowed audiences to over-look gaps in the film’s logic; since Susy is blind, why does Roat bother tochange clothes and disguises each time he comes back to the apartment insearch of the drug-filled doll? In the end, however, the audience’s involve-ment in Susy’s survival proved so intense that it didn’t matter in the slightest,and in his book Danse Macabre, horror king novelist Stephen King calledWait Until Dark the scariest movie of all time.

The film proved an enormous box office hit and scored Audrey her fifthand final Academy Award nomination as Best Actress (she lost to KatharineHepburn for Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner). With her slight physique andunderstated technique, Audrey made audiences forget that the terrorized wo-man onscreen was Hollywood superstar Audrey Hepburn. Through a combin-ation of meticulous preparation and skillfully displayed vulnerability, she hadsucceeded in delivering what is, along with The Nun’s Story, the most unex-pected characterization of her career. Thrilled she was by her AcademyAward nomination, but ever the perfectionist, she later stated with a smile: “Iwas nominated for Wait Until Dark when I liked myself better in Two for theRoad that year.” She’s right; effective as she was in Wait Until Dark, in thatfilm she was portraying a woman who, while navigating an admittedly over-whelming situation, was doing so over the course of a single afternoon. In

Two for the Road, she was portraying one woman in her various incarnationsas newlywed, young wife, and jaded sophisticate, and managed to make eachstage of her character’s life separate and distinct.

After the worldwide success of Wait Until Dark, there was talk that Meland Audrey would join forces once again for a feature-film remake of Mayer-ling. Terence Young was paged to direct, and Mel spent large chunks of timeorganizing the production, but it soon foundered. MGM had always wantedOmar Sharif to play the male lead, and Audrey decided against the film, inlarge part because she felt it was too soon after Wait Until Dark to workagain with Mel. In the end, Catherine Deneuve was cast in the lead role op-posite Sharif, and by then, the Ferrers had moved on—separately.

After thirteen years of marriage, four depressing and debilitating miscar-riages, and one much-loved son, in September 1967 it was publicly an-nounced by Audrey’s mother Ella that “Audrey Hepburn, thirty-eight, andMel Ferrer, fifty, have separated after thirteen years of marriage. Ferrer is inParis and Miss Hepburn is at their home in Switzerland with their son, Sean,seven.”

Sean heard the news directly from his mother: “She sat me down in thebedroom and gave me the news. Then she took me to see The Jungle Book, soas far as I was concerned, it was a good conclusion.” Adding an interestingperspective in later years, Sean explained: “My parents never argued in frontof me, but I was aware from quite a young age that something just wasn’tright. . . . When she told me, I was very upset, naturally because I loved themboth, but I was also relieved in a way, because it explained why things didn’tfeel quite right at home.”

Said Audrey in later years: “I hung on in there as long as I could. For thechild’s sake is why we hang on. Also, out of respect for the marriage and forlove of the person that you once loved. You always hope that if you lovesomebody enough that everything will be ok and things will come togetheragain, but it isn’t always true. . . . When a marriage doesn’t work anymorethen everything becomes destructive.”

Remembering all too well the upset of never seeing her own father,Audrey made certain that Sean maintained consistent contact with Mel: “Thefeeling of family is terribly important. I think it’s essential. I learned as achild that it’s terribly important for a child to have a father. . . .” Sean wouldcontinue to see his father, but Audrey cut off her own direct contact with

Mel; in 1984, sixteen years after the divorce, Mel simply stated: “I don’t hearfrom Audrey, and I respect that. Audrey asked for the divorce.” In later years,he amplified that statement, albeit adding somewhat disingenuously: “I stilldon’t know what the difficulties were. Audrey’s the one who asked for the di-vorce and started the affair with Andrea Dotti.”

Mel’s casual utterance constituted a rare overt public comment on a veryprivate matter, but Audrey never did comment publicly, content in the ensu-ing years to simply state that she had tried to hold her marriage together foras long as possible. Said Sean: “My father spent the rest of his life regrettingthat he had let that relationship go. That was the relationship of his life. Thewoman of his life—no doubt about it.”

As it was, during the next twenty-five years, the only times Audrey spokedirectly with Mel were at Sean’s school graduation and at his 1985 weddingto fashion designer Marina Spadafora. By that time, Mel had remarried,Audrey was living happily with Robert Wolders, and at the reception, Audreyand Mel did dance together as parents of the groom.

They did not, however, share the first dance with each other, and PeterBogdanovich relates the odd but strangely moving anecdote that after Seanand Marina danced together, Audrey walked onto the dance floor with hermovie star friend James Stewart: “For obvious dramatic and strangely ro-mantic reasons—it being Hollywood, after all—the star team that night wasStewart and Hepburn. And it certainly was a memorably electric, mythic mo-ment: two of the last classic movie stars, who never did a picture together—but should have, you’re thinking as you watch them—both tall, trim, andgraceful, dancing cheek to check to a slow tune in the misty light.”

As it turned out, even after the divorce, Audrey kept in close contact withher in-laws, as well as with Mel’s sister Mary and Mary’s son Joe. Said Joeof Audrey: “She was an exceptional person, kind, caring, involved andstrong. She was someone you wished you could be like—a person who, so faras I could see, was even better than she appeared to be.”

Used to sharing his parents with the world, it is Sean, accurately describ-ing himself as his mother’s “spiritual biographer,” who offers a remarkablyclear-eyed view as to how both of his parents shared blame for the diffi-culties: “They were both responsible for the failed marriage, she for project-ing onto it something that wasn’t, and he for not being able to get over him-self at some level. . . . He wasn’t an easy man, by any stretch of the imagina-

tion, even though he was extremely talented, well read, and educated.” Lov-ing but unblinking in his assessment, he added: “He was a perfectionist andalthough graced with a great mind and heart, he had a difficult and tempera-mental personality.”

Explaining further, he reached for vivid metaphorical terms: “She washoping that real love would come in the form of flowers that are sent, not re-quested. And when that proved to be a disappointment, things started to comeapart. . . . There was a lot of love and a lot of difficulty.”

Yes, the widely accepted view is that Mel stifled Audrey, turning hisSvengali tendencies into suffocating control, but Audrey maintained a will ofher own, and Sean seems to fully understand his mother’s role in the breakupas well: “Mostly—it’s on both sides. If you don’t work through the baggageyou’re carrying around you go round and round and can’t get to the nextlevel.” Reflecting on the break up in later years he analyzed: “What shedidn’t do was to speak up and be heard when she needed to, and she didn’tput up healthy boundaries. Exhausted by an authoritarian mother, she wishedfor a world where caring and love came freely.”

His final analysis? “She stayed too long in the marriage, and it had a toxiceffect on her—she kept reacting over and over to the failure of the marriage.”

When the divorce became final in November of 1968, a new life began forAudrey as a single mother. And with that new life came a different look, anew hairstyle. This did not, however, mean a casual trip to the neighborhoodsalon in her Swiss village. No, Audrey’s hair would be cut by none other thanthe world’s most famous stylist—Alexandre de Paris, and her processprovides insight into her status as a painstaking fashionista who nonethelessstrove to make it all look effortless. Ever the perfectionist, she first tried onwigs to decide on the style she liked best. Alexandre then cut and set her hairfour times until it was very short, with “each strand . . . blunt cut, thenthinned diagonally with a razor from root to tip . . . polished with a scissorscut on the bias.” Then and only then was Audrey comfortable enough to de-but her new look.

In that cataclysmic year of 1968, one suffused with assassinations, fer-ment, and loud cries demanding social change, Audrey Hepburn would keepstep with the times. A single woman raising her son. Working rarely and en-joying life far from the Hollywood spotlight. Keeping tabs on her mother.Hiking in the Swiss countryside and puttering in her beloved garden.

Because, after losing her father and surviving miscarriages, divorce, and aworld war, Audrey Hepburn knew with absolute certainty that tomorrow wasnot promised to anyone.

Seize the day.

# A DIFFERENT ROMAN HOLIDAY, 1969–1979

“She took her dogs for walks, navigated the city’s grocery stores, andcooked her favorite dish: spaghetti al pomodoro. Her life in Rome was, byall means, normal. The city and its people were fond of her, and let her be .

CERTAINLY THE MID-1960S HAD CEMENTED Audrey’s place at the top of the Hol-lywood A list, with Charade, My Fair Lady, Two for the Road, and Wait Un-til Dark all garnering critical acclaim and audience approval. And yet, nice asthe approbation was, exactly how much did the acclaim of total strangers ac-tually mean? In Audrey’s case, the answer was “not much”—and certainlynot enough to offset the hurt resulting from the breakup of her marriage toMel.

A failed marriage, not a box office bomb like Paris When It Sizzles, waswhat upset Audrey, and to escape her deepening sense of failure, she decidedupon a change of scenery. The solution? A two-week Mediterranean cruise inJune of 1968 with her friends Princess Olimpia Torlonia and her husband,Paul-Annik Weiller. A cruise upon which she met a close friend of her hosts,the dashing, worldly Italian psychiatrist, Andrea Dotti.

Audrey and Andrea had crossed paths without actually meeting someseven years earlier, at the Italian premiere of Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Thistime, however, introductions were made, and an immediate spark struck;Audrey was attracted by the nine-years-younger Dotti’s intelligence and styl-ish manner, Dotti by Audrey’s glamour and unaffected air. The duo quicklymade plans to spend time together in Turkey later that summer, with that tripproving so successful that two months after Audrey’s divorce from Mel be-

came final (on November 21, 1968) and seven months to the day they firstmet, Audrey and Andrea were married at the town hall in Morges, Switzer-land, on January 18, 1969.

A Swiss wedding was not just a case of making it easy for eight-year-oldSean to attend the ceremony, but also a practical solution to the problem ofthe Catholic Dotti marrying the divorced and Protestant Audrey; a civil cere-mony in a predominantly Protestant country sidestepped the religious issueswhich would have arisen in Roman Catholic Italy. Wearing an originalGivenchy pink minidress accented by a matching headscarf, Audrey, attendedby Doris Brynner and Capucine, was now, for the first time in years, smilingbroadly out of sheer personal happiness.

Audrey would keep her house in Switzerland, but with Andrea’s familyliving in Rome, she would divide her time between the two countries. An-drea’s successful and high-profile practice was based in Rome, which meantthat he would spend the majority of his time in Italy, a state of affairs whichsuited his formidable mother Paola’s expectations nicely. Highly educatedand interested in the arts and culture much more than in homemaking, Paolahad divorced Andrea’s father when her son was still young and then marriedVero Roberti, the London-based correspondent for a Milan newspaper.Audrey and Paola developed a deep mutual affection, with Paola recognizingin Audrey a will as formidable as her own. Audrey, it was clear, would liveher own life and raise her children exactly as she saw fit.

Said Robbie Wolders of Audrey’s embrace of Dotti’s large extended fam-ily: “To become part of a family was extremely important to her. Her ownfamily had lacked that kind of closeness.” She grew particularly close to herfather-in-law Vero Roberti, who had fought the Nazis during the war andproved a decidedly more low-key presence than Paola. When he suffered asevere stroke and Paola, in Luca’s term, “lost her mind” and relegated him toa third-rate hospital, Luca and Audrey went to visit him, only to find them-selves horrified by the conditions. Trying to place him in a better location,Audrey called another facility and was turned down for lack of space. An up-set Luca exclaimed to his mother: “For once in your life, Mummy use yourname.” Such was her affection for Roberto that Audrey acted against her ownself-imposed code of conduct and called the facility once again, this time notas Signora Dotti, but as Audrey Hepburn of Hollywood fame. In Luca’snicely understated summary: “Suddenly there was room.”

In Wolders’s view, Audrey liked spending time with Dotti because “hemade her laugh, he made her feel good about herself.” Said her close friendAnna Cataldi: “At the beginning of the marriage she was so happy to be thewife of a doctor. They were so different but the bond was so strong.” Thesights, sounds, and smells of Rome, as well as the Italian propensity for anopen emotional response to life’s events so unlike the reserved Dutch ap-proach, all appealed. Away from the confines of film sets, Audrey had thetime to appreciate the small details of everyday life, and in a charming remin-iscence, Luca recalled: “Every spring, especially here in Rome, you have thissmell of orange blossom in the air. Spring is coming and it was her favoriteseason. It makes me think of her.”

Although the Milan-based Cataldi stated, “People in Rome, they were notnice to Audrey. . . . She needed desperately to have friends and warmth.People were absolutely awful,” others have spoken of a love affair betweenAudrey and the Eternal City. In the words of Andrew Wald, the son ofAudrey’s great friend Connie Wald: “She loved Rome and Rome loved her.”

Having already spent weeks and even months in Rome while making Ro-man Holiday, War and Peace, and The Nun’s Story, Audrey felt at home, re-sponding to the culture and glorious history with an enthusiasm she had neverfelt for Hollywood. In fact, the idea of living in Hollywood had never evenbeen seriously considered. Yes, Audrey liked the film crews and enjoyed see-ing her friends, but the glitzy trappings held little allure. On nights of galaevents she would often plaintively tell her sons: “I’d give anything to eat inthe kitchen with you boys and go to bed early.” It all fed a determination thather children not grow up in Hollywood’s overly privileged atmosphere. SaidSean: “We didn’t grow up in ‘Hollywood,’ not the place, not the state ofmind. Our mother never watched her own films. Once they were done, thatwas it.”

(Sean, in fact, discovered his mother’s films on his own, projecting 16-millimeter copies of the films on a sheet in the attic of the house in To-lochenaz: “Remember, there was no VHS, no DVDs, no YouTube. I put up asheet and had a Bell & Howell projector. There was that tick-tick-tick soundof the film which somehow added to it—it all added up to a kind of magicalexperience because it was watching real film.”)

Living the life of a “civilian” in Rome proved remarkably easy forAudrey. She had felt at sea in the fast-changing Hollywood of the late 1960s

and early 1970s, where she was surrounded by films awash with violence anda new sexual permissiveness. Aware that her trademark Cinderella-style roleswere not only inappropriate for a woman well into her forties but also fallingout of favor at the box office, Audrey had surprisingly little difficulty walk-ing away. A life out of the spotlight, and especially one in Rome with herhusband and his family, began to suit her remarkably well.

Certainly, it was not difficult to stay at home in the palatial penthouseapartment she and Andrea had found by Ponte Vittorio, some five hundredmeters away from Paola’s three-story villa. In Sean’s recall: “[It] had highceilings and frescoes. It must have been 12,000 to 15,000 square feet.” TheDottis eventually moved to another apartment, this one located in Rome’sParioli district, and they actually included their telephone number in thephone book, a state of affairs matched among show business luminaries onlyby Bob Fosse’s willingness to list his number and address in the New YorkCity phone book.

Audrey now felt free enough to embrace Roman fashion, specifically thatof Valentino, and she formed a fast friendship with the designer. She stillwore Givenchy—now and forever—but she embraced the Roman fashions ofthe times: maxi coats, capes, bell-bottom trousers, silk blouses, and oversizedcardigan sweaters. Shopping for food or strolling through her neighborhood,she sported driving loafers from Gucci and flats from Ferragamo, with tracesof the hippie era showing up in her clothes—it was just hippiedom as filteredthrough Gucci and Valentino. Related Givenchy: “When she needed thingsthat I did not make—a sweater or maybe a trench coat—she’d take me shop-ping with her . . . when she was married to Dr. Dotti and living in Rome,sometimes she needed something immediately and would go to Valentino.But she’d call me up first and say, ‘Hubert, please don’t be furious withme!’” Added Givenchy, unsurprisingly, “We never together had an argu-ment.”

Audrey Hepburn, internationally famous movie star, did not employ a sec-retary and answered her own phone. She was now known in the neighbor-hood as Signora Dotti. In reality, she could have been addressed as CountessDotti because of the title held by Andrea’s father, but neither Audrey norDotti were interested in titles or honorariums. Ella may have liked beingknown as Baroness van Heemstra, but for Audrey, titles were out of the ques-tion. Years after his mother’s death, Sean noted Audrey’s resentment toward

both her parents “for their political and social views, which is also why shelet all of the family’s title of nobility die and be buried with my grand-mother.”

Happy as Audrey and Andrea appeared to be, there were differences to beaccommodated, and not just because Audrey was nine years older than herhusband. A country girl at heart, Audrey now found herself living in themiddle of one of the world’s busiest cities, and her husband was often not athome, busy with both his private practice and as a professor of psychophar-macology at the University of Rome. Of more note, however, it quickly be-came clear that while Audrey may have preferred to cook dinner and watchtelevision at home, Andrea was always happiest when out at the restaurantsand clubs favored by Rome’s smart set.

The noise, heat, chic, and passion of the Eternal City stimulated a constantexcitement in Andrea, and he grew to like the press attention Audrey’s star-dom brought him. As a Roman psychiatrist, Dotti would not have beendeemed especially newsworthy by himself, but as the husband of AudreyHepburn he most definitely was, and when Audrey was in Switzerland, andDotti was photographed out and about in Rome with beautiful women on hisarm, well, that too was news.

When Audrey soon became pregnant, it seemed as if her most ferventwish had been answered. Forty years old, and with a history of miscarriagesbehind her, Audrey took great care in her preparations; aside from time spentpursuing her lifelong love of painting, she was confined to bed rest even asthe whispers about Andrea’s behavior grew louder. When Andrew Wald vis-ited in Rome, Andrea’s idea of hospitality was to take the young man club-bing in Rome, which, allowed Wald, “I didn’t think was the best idea.”

But genuine happiness abounded when son Luca (named after Andrea’sbrother) was born via C-section on February 8, 1970, at Cantonal Hospital inLausanne, Switzerland. Luca may have been born in Switzerland, but hewould grow up in Italy, surrounded by the extended Dotti clan. Italian be-came his first language, and as a youngster, he did not speak English; conver-sations at home were conducted in a mix of French and Italian. As Luca pro-gressed from infant to youngster to schoolboy, and with Audrey hoping formore children (she suffered another miscarriage in 1974), there was still nosign of her returning to the world of movies. Sean was now a full-time stu-dent, and without planning it out in advance, Audrey rather easily made a

life-altering decision: “I began to resent the time I spent away from him onlocation. That was always the real me. The movies were fairy tales. I with-drew to stay home with my children. I was very happy. It is not as if I wassitting at home, frustrated, biting my nails. Like all mothers, I am crazy aboutmy two boys.”

Home remained the anchor, not movies. Wrote Cecil Beaton as far back asa 1964 visit to Mel and Audrey in Bürgenstock: “Her success is astonishingand not only financially. Yet she never allows herself to regard it except asher professional career; it comes second to her private life.” Twenty plusyears later, when promoting Love Among Thieves, her 1987 television movieco-starring Robert Wagner, she sounded the same note when asked howmuch she had wanted to work during the 1970s and 1980s: “Not at all. Not atall. As I think everyone knows, I wanted to be with my sons.”

Unlike Ella, who was so sparing with her praise, Audrey spoke with greatlove about her sons, and right on television; asked by a Dutch television in-terviewer what sprang to mind when she heard the name “Sean,” she smil-ingly answered: “He is my best friend—he has been a rock in my life.Enormous support. Marvelous nature. I think he’s one of the nicest humanbeings I’ve ever met.” The feeling of course proved mutual, and when shownthe video of that interview after his mother had passed away, Sean commen-ted: “We had a tremendous relationship. We were really connected—sort oflike soul mates. We understood each other and had a similar sensibility yetrespected each other’s boundaries. We were two sensitive people who had thesame language. We were from the same tribe. She lacked the moral support,the love of one parent in her own life—her mother was pretty tough. Yet shewas able to take all that and transform it into the ability to say something solovely about us.”

Audrey certainly proved to be a hands-on mother, one who limited heryoung children to one half hour of television at night, and one soda per week.She enforced the usual parental discipline, but with memories of her parents’own loud arguments still fresh in her mind, when she became upset, shewould not yell or even raise her voice. Instead, says Luca, she “showed herdispleasure. And she knew how to make you feel really bad. . . . I becametired of feeling guilt and let it all out by raising my voice; ‘Enough! I’m fedup with your always being unhappy with me! It would be better if yousmacked me!’” Said Sean: “She was, as some like to call her, ‘a steel hand in

a velvet glove.’”

That phrase, in effect another iteration of the phrase “steel magnolia” thathas been particularly applied to southern women ranging from Dolly Partonto Rosalynn Carter, was, as Sean points out, a necessity, particularly for wo-men fending for themselves in the tough patriarchal show business world ofthe 1950s and 60s: “Behind the spritely persona there was an iron fist—therewere rules. You don’t get to where she was without some steel. You have tohave a core of iron if you maintain that stardom for decades, and she did—but she still was always thoughtful and gracious to people.” Mulling over thephrase further, he adds: “It applied to her both professionally and personally.She was herself all the time and was very clear in what was right and wrong.She was not going to waver about it but felt how you say things, your toneand manner, mattered greatly.”

As the boys grew older, life between mother and sons expanded, oftenaround the kitchen table. Rising early, Audrey would walk downstairs in herbathrobe, alternating her lifelong breakfast of coffee, two boiled eggs, andwhole wheat toast with a caffe latte and madeleine, sit at the table and talkwith her sons.

Luca’s reminiscences, a self-described “kitchen table biography” entitledAudrey at Home: Memories of My Mother’s Kitchen, mixes recipes and per-sonal stories, revealing that Audrey could and would now speak more openlyabout her experiences in the war. The trigger for that openness had actuallyoccurred when the eleven-year-old Luca had bought an alarm clock manufac-tured by Krups, and when Audrey saw the name on the clock, so reminiscentof the word “Krupp” painted on the side of German tanks during the war, sheexploded. In Luca’s own words: “She completely flipped out. I couldn’t un-derstand—it was like she found a loaded gun under my pillow.” When Lucaexplained he had no idea whatsoever about the name similarity, Audreythawed, “and from that day she started talking more about the war.”

There were philosophical discussions that touched on surprising topics.Recalled Luca: “We talked about so many things, even politics or euthanasiaor prostitution. Whatever was in the news. And she had a way of making yousee things from a different perspective. She said about prostitution: ‘OK, butlet’s imagine it didn’t exist. This way there would be so many ugly men whowould never meet a nice lady, and this would only make them more frus-trated and even aggressive. That wouldn’t be good either.’”

And, recalled Luca, as the talks flitted from topic to topic, “almost uncon-sciously, small talk would turn into a confession.” Letting down her guard,Audrey would discuss her childhood, speaking in depth about the loss of herfather and the devastation his abrupt disappearance had wreaked upon herown self-image. Said Luca: “I learned to know her better at the breakfasttable.”

Over those early breakfasts, she talked about food, specifically her lifelonglove of chocolate, explaining that she found it helped “banish sadness” andhad done so since childhood. When her parents argued, she explained, shewould eat—her own fingernails, bread, or best of all, chocolate. “Chocolatewas my one true love as a child. It wouldn’t betray me. I’ve always said itwas either chocolate or my nails in those years. There was a lot of anxiety.”The love of chocolate never did abate, and, explained Edith Head, after oneof their intensive shopping expeditions, Audrey would set her eye on achocolate reward: “‘And now let’s celebrate,’ she’d say when we were ex-hausted, and that meant heading for the nearest confectionery to devour twoof the biggest, fattest, most chocolatey French pastries.”

Audrey often told the story of receiving seven chocolate bars from a Brit-ish soldier at the end of the war, and how, after having nearly starved todeath, she gorged on the chocolate until she became sick. Starvation, food,and self-image were all inextricably bound, and yet characteristically, sheeven found positives in the discipline resulting from the horrors of the war:“Being in Holland during the war—it was a terrible experience but it was fi-nally enriching in ways. . . . Whatever I suffered has helped me later on.” Sherefused to drown in bleakness, instead constantly moving forward and mend-ing herself in a determination to accept all she had been given: “I’m a longway from the human being I’d like to be. But I’ve decided I’m not so badafter all.”

Having turned sixty in 1989, she mused about the perpetual self-doubtwith which she had finally made peace, in her own way seeming to accept thephilosophy of Bruce Springsteen that “everybody’s broken in some way.” Inher acute self-analysis: “I still feel I could lose everything at any moment.But the greatest victory has been to be able to live with myself, to accept myshortcomings and those of others.”

She may have confided in Luca over those early morning breakfasts, butto the public in an autobiography? Never. In a 1990 television interview with

Phil Donahue, she allowed as how “I might one day if I have time, have theurge write a book, about experiences, feelings, something I want to express,but it would never be a biography . . .” She had lived long enough to see sev-eral biographies of her life appear, and magazine articles purporting to tell theworld about the “real” Audrey Hepburn continued unabated for decades, butthere would be no reliving the war years or sharing of private pain. In short,as she explained to Luca, there would never be a summing up of her life writ-ten from her own perspective: “I would have to tell the whole truth Luchino, Icould not speak only about the beautiful things. And I do not want to speak illof others.”

With the birth of Luca in 1970, Audrey proved happy to putter about thekitchen, and she liked having family and friends come to her home for meals.It all proved easier than going out and dealing with the paparazzi, whose con-tinuous intrusion occasioned one of Audrey’s rare complaints: “The onlytime my fame was a little hard for me was when my second son was born. Iwas living in Rome and I could not take him anywhere without paparazzi. Itwas bothering the child. That really drove me mad. To have photographersjump out from behind trees—he’d be howling because he was so startled. Adear friend who had a beautiful garden said bring him here as often as youwant with other children and that solved the problem.”

Having her picture snapped by the paparazzi was of no interest to Audrey,and yet a trace of the international superstar remained; she may not haveliked the press, but her chef Florida Broadway observed that in some waysAudrey enjoyed the attention of being recognized: “Sometimes I think shemade sure that they did, although she was subtle about it.” In this respectAudrey resembled “the other” Hepburn, as the once fiercely private Kathar-ine cagily devised new ways of keeping her name in the spotlight after lead-ing lady roles dried up. Once a well-guarded private sanctum, Katharine’sNew York City townhouse was now graced by visits from select reportersand even television crews. Private letters to Spencer Tracy were read out loudon television, and a friendship with Michael Jackson was publicly discussed.The need for the oxygen of stardom had not abated.

But in the main, Audrey continued to guard her privacy fiercely, and inLuca’s recall, so thoroughly did she cede the spotlight that when he was alittle boy and journalists asked about Audrey Hepburn, he would reply:“‘You are mistaken. I am the son of Mrs. Dotti. . . .’ At home Dad was the

center of attention.”

So successfully had Audrey cut off her personal life from her Hollywoodcareer that even the young Luca was not really sure what she had to do withthe world of movies. Like any child, Luca loved his own birthday parties, andin those pre–home video days, his favorite part of the celebration would bethe special treat of watching movies. He was a fan of Chitty Chitty BangBang, as well as Mary Poppins and My Fair Lady, and yet, in his smiling re-call: “None of us, however, not even I, managed to completely connect ElizaDoolittle, who spoke in cockney on the screen, with the lady who oversawthe distribution of plates of pasta al forno.”

Serving pasta appealed far more than did a glitzy Hollywood premiere,which was why her decision to walk away from Hollywood dovetailed soneatly with her new life as Mrs. Andrea Dotti. Grateful as Audrey was for allthat acting had brought her, family and home brought her much greater ful-fillment, and by the dawn of the 1970s, she continued to find reasons not towork.

Part of that choice lay in the fact that her modesty and refusal to take partin the Hollywood scene had given her a genuine private life, with public andpaparazzi alike granting her more distance and greater respect than were everaccorded the Elizabeth Taylors and Marilyn Monroes of the world. And be-cause she had been granted that privacy and developed a fulfilling life awayfrom the cameras, it had proven that much easier to walk away from Holly-wood after securing another Academy Award nomination for Wait UntilDark. The decision had developed in stages; there was no sentimental appear-ance at a retirement press conference to garner one last burst of adulation, noteven a mention of the word “retirement.” As in demand as ever, she hadsimply walked away. On her own terms.

# Chapter Thirty-SevenNINE YEARS OF SILENCE, 1967–1976

“I don’t regret for one minute making the decision to quit movies for mychildren. If I just had movies to look back on, I’d not have known myboys.”

—Audrey Hepburn

THE SEEDS FOR AUDREY’S NINE years of silence are easily discernible whenplaced in the context of her overall career: even in her 1950s and early 1960sheyday as one of the biggest movie stars in the world, she never displayed thedrive for acting that she had regarding ballet: “Although I had great respectfor the art and craft of acting, I never really cared for the business. Theythought me inconsiderate. The fact is, I cared too much, but only about thethings that really counted.”

Audrey’s refusal to prioritize making films is fully revealed by a consider-ation of the contrast between her rather slim twenty-two feature-length-filmappearances from 1951 through 1993, and the bulging resumes of MerylStreep and her fellow Academy Award winner, Nicole Kidman. As of 2023,Streep had appeared in seventy-eight feature films and television series withanother nearly two dozen voiceover and narration credits to her name, whileKidman had compiled a staggering ninety feature film and television credits.Acting may have appeared to be the very stuff of oxygen for Kidman andStreep, but for Hepburn it held place as a nice but nonessential part of life.

Family and home only proved to be part of the story, however. Some ofAudrey’s reluctance to continue making movies came from the terrors shefelt before filming a scene, terrors which never evaporated and ultimatelytook a cumulative toll: “I really die a million deaths every time. My stomachturns over, my hands get clammy. I do suffer. I really do. I wasn’t cut out to

do this kind of thing. I really wasn’t.”

Ironically, the more unavailable Audrey had made herself, the greater thepublic’s interest in her. Would Garbo have maintained her powerful decades-long hold on the public imagination if she had remained in Hollywood or ap-peared in more films after 1941’s flop Two-Faced Woman? The answer is un-known, but her passion for privacy informed her entire legend. Doris Daywillingly walked away from Hollywood in the mid-1970s and never returned,yet remained an object of fascination, just as did Audrey’s not-quite-kinKatharine Hepburn, who had mastered the art of selective disappearance. Inthe case of Katharine Hepburn, however, a canny strategy underlay her re-fusal to appear at premieres or ever attend a Hollywood party; unlike Audrey,she always wanted to keep working, and if the right role came along, sud-denly a slew of “exclusive” interviews with Katharine Hepburn would springforth, right alongside a canny appearance at a concert given by her friend Mi-chael Jackson.

Audrey, however, would have been more than happy to never again dealwith the press. She had, like Jackie Onassis, Garbo, and author Harper Lee,opted out of that all-consuming American church of fame. In their heyday, allfour women carried a sense of mystery, an impossibility in today’s age ofSnapchat, Instagram, and X. Hard as it is to imagine in the internet age,Audrey personified the idea of a star who remained private at her essentialcore. Gracious and unfailingly polite, she had perfected the art of seemingopen and accessible while revealing precisely nothing.

What Onassis, Garbo, and Harper Lee shared with Audrey was a simpleyet deep desire for privacy—in Garbo’s terms a desire not necessarily to bealone but to be left alone; said Audrey: “People who would rob you of yourdearest possession—your privacy—aren’t worth having as friends. . . . I feeleach individual has the right to keep some things to himself.” As she furtherexplained: “I can spend time happily alone because I know somebody is go-ing to walk in the door. I’m rather cheerful by nature—it’s my best defenseagainst the aches on the inside.”

It was therefore not really a surprise that after the 1967 release of WaitUntil Dark, Audrey undertook only two spots of work in the next four years,both of such a fleeting nature that the majority of the public did not evenknow about them. In the first, the globetrotting multinational 1971 televisiondocumentary A World of Love produced by UNICEF (with whom she did not

yet have any formal association), Audrey filmed a brief appearance extollinglife in Italy. In the second and even briefer turn before the cameras, she re-ceived a $100,000 payday for two days of work filming a television commer-cial for the Tokyo-based wig company Varie.

If, during the early days of her career, Audrey had rarely paused to catchher breath as she raced from Gigi to Roman Holiday to Ondine, by 1976, nineyears had elapsed since her last starring role in Wait Until Dark. A lifetime inHollywood years. Two lifetimes. Her absence was certainly not tied up in afear of appearing old on camera. Said Luca: “She was actually happy aboutgrowing older because it meant more time for herself, more time for her fam-ily and separation from the frenzy of youth and beauty that is Hollywood.” InAudrey’s own reasoning: “I can’t be a leading lady all my life. That’s whyI’d be thrilled if people offered me character parts in the future. I won’t resentit. Either you have to face up to it and tell yourself you’re not going to beeighteen all your life or be prepared for a terrible shock when you see thewrinkles and white hair.”

Did she miss making movies? Some—not much: “I could survive withoutworking but I couldn’t survive without my family. That is why my privatelife has always taken precedence.” She certainly did not apologize for hertime away from the movies: “I worked from the age of 13 for 25 yearsstraight. That’s why I think I’ve deserved this time off.”

The biggest reason for Audrey’s absence from the screen may have beenthe desire to raise her children, but as the chief architect of her own career,she had also found almost all of the scripts submitted to her in the previousnine years severely lacking; not for Audrey the gargoyle roles foisted uponthe aging likes of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis.

But just as she thought her nine years of silence might happily stretch outfor at least another nine years, an intriguing script came her way: Robin andMarian—the story of the middle-aged Robin Hood and Maid Marian. Thefilm’s Academy Award–winning screenwriter James Goldman (The Lion inWinter) was so interested in landing Audrey for the role of Marian that hepersonally left the screenplay right by her door at New York City’s PlazaHotel. And how did she react? Intrigued by the script, Audrey quickly signedon, embracing the chance to portray a three-dimensional woman her own age:“There’s a great need in films today for mature women to be seen playingmature women. And this was one of the few stories where I could be my own

age. I like that.”

In Goldman’s witty screenplay, the middle-aged Maid Marian, now themother abbess of a nunnery, is entirely consumed by her vocation until, aftera twenty-year absence, she once again crosses paths with Robin Hood. Onsome level that likely spoke to Audrey, the ultra-disciplined, self-effacing lifeof a nun seemed to resemble the life of self-denial required by the world ofballet, and Marian’s voluntary immersion into the cloistered life seemed toecho Audrey’s own retreat from Hollywood into the small, private world ofTolochenaz.

If Two for the Road (1967) examined the reality of a marriage after all theexcitement has died down, then Robin and Marian would peel back the cur-tain to look at the reality behind the fairy-tale promise of “happily ever after.”For Audrey, appalled as she was by the cynical violence permeating thescreen, Goldman’s script presented a rare opportunity for a mature woman tomake a positive statement. Marian’s decision to reunite with Robin and turnaway from her religious vows is hers alone, a strong woman following herown internal compass. In Audrey’s words: “Such a poetic idea.”

On set Audrey would be surrounded by friends like producer RichardShepherd (Breakfast at Tiffany’s), and with her two sons now sixteen and six,the time, she admitted, might just be right to make another film: seventeenyears following the release of The Nun’s Story, Audrey would once again beappearing onscreen in a nun’s robe.

# AS IF WE NEVER SAID GOODBYE, 1976

“I don’t know why I’m frightenedI know my way around here”

—Andrew Lloyd Webber/Don Black, Sunset Boulevard

CERTAINLY, A PORTION OF AUDREY’S willingness to commit to Robin and Marianlay in the chance to work with the first-rate supporting cast anchored byNicol Williamson, Ian Holm, and Robert Shaw, but the biggest enticement ofall lay in the presence of her co-star, Sean Connery. Connery, whose determ-ination to break out of the James Bond mold had already resulted in rolesboth suspenseful (The Anderson Tapes, 1971) and sweeping (The Wind andthe Lion, 1975), appealed not only to Audrey but perhaps even more cru-cially, in her view, to her sons. All Sean and Luca needed to hear was that shewould be making a movie with James Bond, and the desire for their mother togo back to work leapt upward.

Lucrative deals were signed: Connery would be paid $\$ 1$ million andAudrey $\$ 750,000$ . The American-born but London-based Richard Lester,whose frenetic style had become famous with the Beatles films A Hard Day’sNight (1964) and Help! (1965), signed on as director: after nine long years,Audrey Hepburn’s return to movies had become a reality.

Trouble, however, lay dead ahead in Audrey’s relationship with Lester, asituation which was clear from their very first meeting in the summer of1975. At the appointed time for a meet-and-greet between star and director,Lester, who was playing tennis, greeted Audrey through the fence surround-ing the court but did not take the time to interrupt his game. Said a ColumbiaPictures producer: “Audrey could get along with Hitler, but Lester is not inher scrapbook of unforgettable characters.”

Lester did, in fact, respect Audrey, calling her a good sport about her un-flattering and voluminous nun’s habit: “After topping all the lists of the bestdressed women in her career, here she was in her comeback film dressed inan over-large oven glove.” He would not, however, bend his informal,speeded-up style of filmmaking to suit Audrey’s needs, and in that refusalprovided her with an abrupt introduction to the rapidly changing world of latetwentieth-century filmmaking. Lester was not interested in reshoots and re-takes, and instead used several cameras to capture each scene, often shootingonly one take.

Used to William Wyler’s endless retakes, Audrey underwent a somewhattrying adjustment to this informal, helter-skelter style of filming. Said sonSean: “She loved working with Sean Connery, but not with the director.Lester was introverted, not vocal, and rushed through things. Interestingly,when discussing the making of her various films, she said to me that the qual-ity of the experience often has nothing to do with the outcome. Some of thefilms that were nightmares to make ended up the greatest successes, andsome that were joys—filming in Paris, traveling the globe—turned out to bethe duds of the century.” For Audrey, in fact, it always had been about thejourney more than the destination: “I think of my career as a happy blur ofwonderful, very human experiences more than as jobs or work. There was al-ways something marvelous—friendships, places.”

Speaking to the press once location shooting had begun in Pamplona,Audrey confessed her anxiety: “I still find it terrifying to start a film. . . .Filming isn’t like riding a bicycle, it doesn’t just come back overnight afterso long: even in the best artistic surroundings, in the end you are still alone.”

Such uncertainty was exacerbated by Lester’s unceasingly hectic pace,with filming completed after a mere thirty-six days. More used to the pacefound on the four-and-a-half-month shooting schedule for My Fair Lady,Audrey grew uneasy, her feelings not helped by the fact that cinematographerDavid Watkin, a friend of Lester’s, did not filter any of her close-ups. Therewould be no flattering lighting for a beautiful but nonetheless aging star, juststraightforward, shoot-it-as-fast-as-you-can filmmaking. Ever tactful, Audreyspoke of Lester as “a whiz-bang with his many cameras and single takes.”Author Charles Higham put it more bluntly: “He was in a hurry all the time,and his personality was grating, tough, and totally at odds with both Audreyand the subject matter of the film.” When, during filming, Audrey was unex-

pectedly thrown off of a horse-drawn cart into a river, Lester did not even call“Cut” but let the filming continue, keeping the resulting shot in the final cutof the film.

She may have felt rushed and in her own words “still alone” on the set, butthe finished film made it clear that Audrey Hepburn remained in full posses-sion of her considerable acting skills. With the Spanish countryside standingin for England’s Nottingham Forest, sweeping panoramas prove the order ofthe day until, a full thirty minutes after the movie has started, Maid Marianarrives on the scene. Her look of wonder as she sees Robin for the first timein twenty years instantly lays bare both her tenderness and her deepest de-sires. Her short but curly hair suits her gracefully aging face, and even themother abbess’s sack of a habit cannot camouflage Audrey’s ease of move-ment. Her voice, still an elusive mix of smoke and fog, gives full value toGoldman’s oft-times witty script:

Marian (to Robin): You never wrote.

Robin: I don’t know how.

But it is in its depiction of middle-aged romance that the heart of the filmtruly lies, the setting almost irrelevant to the film’s consideration of love, de-sire, and sacrifice. Hepburn and Connery play beautifully together, her digni-fied femininity matched step for step by his solid masculinity. When Mariantentatively asks Robin: “Am I old and ugly?” his response is simply to hugher. The words, when they do come, are precise and eloquent, touching intheir simplicity. Fiercely declaring her love even after twenty years in a con-vent, Marian lays bare her heart: “I love you. I love you more than morningprayer, more than sunlight. I love you more than God.”

Concerned about her acting after nine years away from the cameras,Audrey could not even judge her performance from the daily rushes, asLester did not allow his actors to see the footage, and she saw the completedfilm for the first time alongside six thousand fellow spectators at the RadioCity Music Hall premiere on March 11, 1976. Her reaction to the film re-mained mixed; pleased by her palpable onscreen rapport with Connery, shenonetheless felt frustrated by the fact that the romance between Robin andMarian remained curiously truncated: “With all these men I was the one whohad to defend the romance in the picture. Somebody had to take care of

Marian.” She was, unsurprisingly, particularly upset with the fact that afterMarian poisons herself as well as Robin, the film ends with shots of rottingfruit. Her disappointment was, as always, expressed in understated fashion,and she simply murmured: “I could’ve done without that last close-up of fruitturning rotten.” Asked about her overall reaction to the film, she smiled andexplained: “I shall have to see it again before I decide.”

What was almost lost in all the talk of comebacks and the changing natureof Hollywood filmmaking was the fact that Audrey’s skill as an actress had,if anything, deepened in the nine years since her last movie. Tenderness flick-ers across her face in a matter of seconds, as does the abrupt masking of emo-tions, and with nearly a decade of additional life experience under her belt,she imbues Marian with a hard-won wisdom, ultimately presenting a three-di-mensional portrait of a mature woman who is by turns feisty, difficult, loving,and wise.

Commented Frank Rich in the New York Post: “This is a film about le-gends, and legends become even more beautiful with age. . . . The movie re-minds us that legends never die—that they are, instead, perpetually reborn.”Even more indicative of audience reaction was Jay Cocks’s declaration inTime magazine: “The moment she appears on the screen is startling, not forher thorough, gentle command nor yet for her beauty, which seemsheightened and renewed. It is rather that we are reminded of how long it hasbeen since an actress has so beguiled us and captured our imagination. Hep-burn is unique, and now almost alone.”

Genuinely surprised by the enthusiastic standing ovation she receivedfrom the Radio City audience, Audrey agreed to a full round of press appear-ances in order to promote the film. With all of her customary politeness—John Isaac noted that on UNICEF trips she was “respectful to everyone. Mostof the time she would address people as ‘Sir’ or ‘Madam’”—she nonethelesskept her accustomed distance, accompanied by bodyguards and refusing aninterview with Barbara Walters, whom she felt would ask too many personalquestions. Her trademark tact had not deserted her and barraged with ques-tions about her purported “comeback,” she gracefully swatted away the veryidea: “I keep hearing that I am making a comeback. I don’t think of it as that.It is a homecoming.”

Asked about her years away from Hollywood she explained: “I’m glad tohave missed what’s been happening in the movies these last eight years. It’s

all been sex and violence, and I’m far too scrawny to strip and I hate guns, soI’m better off out of it.” Four years later she sounded the same note in an in-terview with the New York Times, explaining that she would not participate inthe filming of violent, nihilistic films just for the sake of working: “I couldnever be cynical. I wouldn’t dare. I’d roll over and die before that.”

In that declaration of following the dictates of her own internal compasslay the explanation of exactly why audience affection for her had, if anything,only grown in fervor.

Audrey Hepburn, all of her fans understood, was as genuine and true toherself as they hoped. She could not lie.

# Chapter Thirty-Nine

# WHAT COULD GO WRONG, PART 2—1970s

“Doctors are great with their patients, but they never want to take care oftheir families.”

—Audrey Hepburn

LIE, AUDREY WOULD NOT. BUT that did not mean that she would reveal all. Farfrom it. In fact clues as to the state of the Hepburn-Dotti marriage—the dif-fering temperaments, divergent expectations, and contradictory life goals—had to be discerned in the subtext of the interviews Audrey so rarely granted.Polite as always, she would limit the interview to thirty minutes, knowingthat any additional time would bring a barrage of personal questions about ahost of topics she did not wish to discuss. Audrey was here displaying a tech-nique she had perfected as far back as 1953 with Roman Holiday and Sab-rina; having been politely bamboozled by Audrey’s reticence, interviewerKirtley Baskette reflected that “the Dutch treat with the English accent talksbut tells nothing. If you ask a personal question she smiles sweetly and is assilent as the sphinx.”

It’s therefore all the more surprising that while living in Rome, Audreyand husband Andrea did grant one joint interview to McCall’s Magazine. Theinterview reveals Dotti in a far more relaxed frame of mind than Audrey,even donning his psychiatrist’s hat and offering rather keen insight into herpsyche. After first expounding upon why he thinks the search for security andthe search for love are intertwined, he goes on to say of his wife: “She’s aperfectionist, with a strong need for security. She must have matters undercontrol and she’s afraid of surprises.”

Hints of an unraveling can be glimpsed in Audrey’s musings about thevery nature of marriage: “Marriage should be only one thing: two people de-

cide they love each other so much that they want to stay together. Whetherthey sign a piece of paper or not, it’s still a marriage with a sacred contract oftrust and respect. . . . So, if in some way I don’t fulfill what he needs in a wo-man—emotionally, physically, sexually, or whatever it is—and if he needssomebody else, then I would not stick around. I’m not the kind to stay andmake scenes.”

A turning point in both the marriage and life in Italy now occurred forpolitical, not personal, reasons. 1970s Rome was awash with rumors of kid-nappings to be carried out by the militant, violently leftist Red Brigades, andthe unsettled political atmosphere understandably made Audrey afraid for thevery safety of her sons. Her general sense of unease came to a head whenfour masked men attempted to kidnap Andrea on the street, a kidnappingfoiled only after Dotti’s screams for help reached two nearby security guardswho ran over and chased the men away. Andrea was left with seven stitchesin his head, and Audrey’s nervous state was further exacerbated when she re-ceived a threatening phone call. A crisis point had been reached, leadingAudrey to tell Sean: “You can stay with us and a bodyguard or you can go toSwitzerland and have a normal life.” Recalled Sean: “I was thirteen. I choseLe Rosey school in Switzerland and received my French baccalaureate whenI was seventeen.”

Although still based in Rome, Audrey now began spending more time inSwitzerland, which meant that Andrea felt an increasing freedom to resumehis jet-set lifestyle. Photographers began snapping pictures of him out on thetown with a bevy of beautiful women; pictures of Dr. Andrea Dotti, phil-andering husband of Audrey Hepburn, proved marketable, and when thestory of Andrea’s partying was reported in the National Enquirer, Audrey felthumiliated. Arguments ensued. That the marriage was falling apart was pain-fully clear when Audrey stated: “My marriage is basically happy. . . . I can’tmeasure it in percentages, because you can never do that with a relationship.”

Said Mita Ungaro, a neighbor in Rome whose mother was a great friend ofAudrey’s: “She loved Andrea. But Andrea had a very destructive part of him-self. He had a complicated personality. He was a serious doctor . . . and yethe was a typically Roman man.” Putting the problem in blunter terms, grand-daughter Emma stated: “He was committing a lot of adultery. He was photo-graphed with over two hundred women by one of the Italian paparazzi.” Inthe words of Dotti himself: “I was no angel. Italian husbands have never been

famous for being faithful.”

For a sensitive, love-starved woman like Audrey, the sense of betrayalproved overwhelming. In the view of Anna Cataldi: “It was devastating,totally devastating. Audrey was suffering a lot—she told me ‘I suffer somuch.’” Observed family friend Marilena Pilat: “If you see pictures ofAudrey from that time, she lost a little bit of light in her eyes. . . . I couldn’tunderstand why such a sweet lady like her had to find herself with a man whowouldn’t deserve her, wouldn’t understand her. . . . She struggled with theidea of a perfect family, with very simple things that make life easy. I don’tthink she had that—everything she had to fight for.”

By now, husband and wife were leading separate lives and living in differ-ent countries. Said Audrey: “My husband and I had what you would call anopen arrangement. It’s inevitable when the man is younger. I wanted the mar-riage to last. Not just for our own sake, but for that of the son we had to-gether.” But her intimates all noted the strain, and in later years her twoclosest male companions, Hubert de Givenchy and Robert Wolders, bothused the same word to characterize Audrey’s reaction: “suffering.” RecalledHubert: “When she suffered—and she suffered a great deal—she kept it toherself. I sensed her in turmoil but naturally, I dared not ask any questions.”Wolders echoed the observation in words which give insight into how deeplyAudrey’s feelings ran—a gift when it came to her acting, but a hindrancewhen personal life turned sour: “Once she sensed that she could trust some-body, she’d do anything for them. And if she were disappointed in them, itwould be the end of the world for her. She suffered more than most of us.”

The Dottis officially separated, and Audrey moved into a small house, al-beit in the same Parioli district of Rome. In Luca’s remembrance, during allthis turmoil his mother consciously tried to distance herself from him “in or-der to hide her sadness from me.” Sean methodically explains: “She realizedthat this charming simpatico Italian husband was just that—an Italian hus-band who was going out to clubs while she was pregnant with my littlebrother. He was not faithful. The marriage really lasted about three years:they were married in $^ { , 6 9 }$ , my brother was born in 1970. When I was going toschool in Switzerland in 1974, they were already leading basically separatelives. But she still had hopes, she still hoped that it would work out. . . Dottihad moved into his own place while my mother moved into a smaller place.He was living across the street so that he could see his son. This little boy

would sit in the window waiting for his father to come—which he rarely did.. . . When Luca went to boarding school near Lake Geneva, two hours fromLa Paisible, my mother moved back to Switzerland.”

Writing about his father and the family home in Switzerland, Luca bluntlystated: “La Paisible—the place of peace—seen through the filter of his sar-casm, soon became La Penible—the place of pain.” But no matter the stressesand strains she felt, just as she had never spoken ill of Mel Ferrer to Sean,Audrey would never speak critically about Andrea to Luca, placing the valueof her child’s relationship with his father above any momentarily satisfyingcriticism of her spouse.

Sean has painted a dark picture of his mother’s deteriorating marriage toDotti, pointing out that the eroding of trust and security did not spring upovernight but continued year after year: “He did it over ten years—in the be-ginning when she was pregnant. When she found out. When they were separ-ated. Then when she tried again to save the marriage.” At the end of the mar-riage, the situation turned particularly upsetting, culminating when Seancame home in the spring of 1978: “When I came home, I found her in bed,and she had taken a bunch of sleeping pills. Dreadful. He killed the marriageevery day, for ten years. The effect on my mother was absolutely devastat-ing.”

Ruminating upon the stresses of a failing marriage, Audrey explained:“Your heart just breaks, that’s all. Men are human beings with all the frailtieswomen have. Perhaps they are more vulnerable than women. I think you canhurt a man so easily. You cannot judge, you cannot point fingers, you cannotput anybody in a mold. You’ve just got to be lucky enough to find somebodywho you can satisfy and then who pleases you if you’re lucky.”

Now spending all of their time apart, the Dottis’ separation was announcedin September 1980 by Vero Roberti; after thirteen years of marriage, the lastthree of which had been spent living apart, the divorce was finalized in 1982.In later years Audrey analyzed: “I clung on to both marriages very hard, foras long as I could, for the children’s sake and out of respect for marriage. ButI just couldn’t manage that.” Her childlike belief that loving and looking afterothers ensures that they will act in the same way had been shattered. Admit-ted Audrey: “Dotti was not much of an improvement on Ferrer.”

Twenty-two by the time Audrey and Dotti divorced, Sean has cast a real-istic view at both Dotti’s failings and his mother’s own wishful thinking:

“My stepfather was a brilliant funny psychiatrist—but he was a hound dog . .. I think she knew from the beginning who [Dotti] was, yet I think shedreamed and hoped that somehow she could change that. And I think she wasgravely disappointed when she realized she couldn’t.” In Sean’s view though,“what she didn’t do was to speak up and be heard when she needed to andshe didn’t put up healthy boundaries.”

Commentators through the decades have rushed to draw a contrastbetween the authoritarian Svengali-like Ferrer, domineering and jealous ofAudrey’s success, and the charming, brilliant, compulsively unfaithful Dotti,but Sean, in fact, is the one person with firsthand knowledge who has pointedout the similarities between the two men that led to the failed marriages:“Both men had been emotionally scarred by equally powerful and brilliantmothers who, as a result of their backgrounds, their education, and the soci-etal rules of their times, didn’t connect with their children at a profound emo-tional level.”

For his part, Luca summed up the failed marriage by explaining: “Grow-ing up, I was struck above all by how different they were . . . Dad with hisLatin male cynicism, and Mum with her rigid northern upbringing and diffi-culty speaking about feelings.” From the perspective of his own adult years,Luca observed that with his mother being the older of his two parents, “it wasmy father who was too young, still immature. Sometimes I find myself think-ing, completely irrationally, how different things would have been had theymet later, when dad had changed.” As it was, Dotti never remarried, continu-ing his practice and teaching until he died in 2007.

Two failed marriages. Disillusioned, hurt, and vulnerable, a downcast andchastened Audrey explained: “You always hope that if you love somebodyenough, everything will be all right—but it isn’t always true.” Fifty years old,Audrey now spent her time puttering about in her garden. Looking after herboys when they were home. Cooking. But it wasn’t enough after the breakupof her marriage, and she began thinking about a return to the world of movie-making. It had been three years since the release of Robin and Marian, and anew film would take her mind off her troubles. Surrounded by cast and crewon location, she would have less time to ruminate.

Scripts were submitted. Offers were made, and Audrey Hepburn nowsigned on to headline the all-star film adaptation of Sidney Sheldon’s best-selling novel Bloodline. On paper it all looked promising. In reality it proved

to be the worst film of her career.

“The movies that came after the breakup with Andrea Dotti are not a truereflection of the whole career.”

—Sean Ferrer

ONCE ASKED IN AN INTERVIEW if she had ever made a film for the money,Audrey responded: “No, never. Never. I’ve never done that . . .” The answerwas, as always proved the case with Audrey, entirely truthful. Making thetawdry pseudo thriller Bloodline got her out of the house, and the hefty $1million payday she received for that film was the bonus, a substantial one.Who wouldn’t want to earn $\$ 1$ million to star in a film based on an interna-tional bestseller?

When she stepped away from Hollywood after Wait Until Dark, she hadbeen only thirty-eight years old and had, she explained to an interviewer inflawless Italian, missed moviemaking “in an emotional way.” Son Sean putsthe decision in perspective: “After her retirement—the years away from themovies—my father wasn’t around any longer, so she wasn’t getting theproper advice and support. She needed to get out of the house because shewas in the middle of a divorce from Dotti. She needed to be on the set think-ing about something else.”

Which is not to say Audrey instantly acquiesced to Bloodline. DirectorTerence Young, a fellow client of Kurt Frings, had direct personal and pro-fessional connections with Audrey, yet he found obtaining her approval asdaunting a task as shooting the movie itself: “First of all you spend a year orso convincing her to accept even the principle that she might make anothermovie in her life. Then you have to persuade her to read the script . . . then

you have to persuade her that she will not be totally destroying her son’s lifeby spending six or eight weeks on a film set. . . . Then, more probably, she’llsay she has to get back to her family and cooking.”

Blame it on Audrey’s restlessness, but whatever Young’s specific bland-ishments, they worked, and she signed a lucrative deal calling for a $\$ 1$ mil-lion guarantee against a percentage of the profits. After surviving the warwith next to no money, a $\$ 1$ million salary brought with it security, if nothappiness, and yet the doubts about her own abilities had not abated: “Am Igoing to be able to do it? You don’t gain more confidence, you gain a certainphilosophy.”

But, she figured, how bad could it be? Young was a friend, filming wouldtake place relatively close to home in Sardinia and Copenhagen, interiorswould be shot at Cinecitta in Rome, and no lengthy excursion to Hollywoodwould prove necessary. To top it off, for the first time since 1966’s How toSteal a Million, her onscreen wardrobe would be designed by Givenchy. Per-haps an all-star international thriller could be the ticket to box office success.

Ironically, the film did not in fact really need to be a success, funded as itwas by a German film syndicate, Geria, which only needed to spend thefilm’s $\$ 10$ million budget by the end of the year to lessen their tax liabilities.Expenditure was all, and quality, if there was any, simply a bonus.

Unsurprisingly, warning signs loomed from the start. Bloodline was nowbeing billed as Sidney Sheldon’s Bloodline, the potboiler novelist’s status asan international best-selling author guaranteeing him star billing. It’s unfortu-nate that Audrey did not read the Sheldon novel after director Young passedit along to her, because if she had, it likely would have given her more than amoment’s pause. Aside from the contrived mechanics of the plot, in the novel“Elizabeth Rolfe” was twenty-three, and even now, her adjusted age of thirty-five registered like nothing so much as a wan acknowledgment of Audrey’sown fifty years.

Of more import, however, Audrey either did not know or perhaps did notcare that the underwritten part of cosmetics tycoon Elizabeth had alreadybeen rejected by Jacqueline Bisset, Candice Bergen, and Diane Keaton. But ifAudrey wanted to return to the movies what exactly were her choices? As thewise old master Billy Wilder pointed out: “The difficulty with stars is, whatdo they do at fifty or fifty-five?” Or, in the even more trenchant words ofCarrie Fisher: “There are not a lot of choices for women past twenty-seven.”

In a 1978 interview with critic Rex Reed during filming, Audrey perhapsunintentionally revealed just why, in the wake of the breakup of her secondmarriage, she would take on flimsy material like Bloodline: “All I really wantnow is not to be lonely, and to have my garden.” Two marriages, two belovedsons, and decades of adulation from adoring fans still could not fill the voidof loneliness left over from childhood or the heartache of a second brokenmarriage. Although during filming the cast and crew left her alone out of re-spect, the distanced interactions proved so remote that she expressed the de-sire for more time with her fellow actors, not less: “It can be very lonely in acrowd. Why is everybody so worshipful?”

To those who asked, Audrey expressed contentment with the material: “Ithought it was exciting. I’m not a snob about movies. They don’t have to behigh art, just enjoyable and fun. Besides, what woman wouldn’t want aGivenchy wardrobe? You’d have thought after staying away so long that thepublic would forget me, not want me anymore. It’s delightful to feel wanted.”

It was a brave attempt at putting a positive spin on the second-rate mater-ial, but nothing really helped. According to Beatrice Straight, one ofAudrey’s co-stars, Audrey seemed to realize while still filming that she wasstuck in a turkey: “Audrey, who’d come with her own bodyguard, but de-cided after a while that, on balance, she’d rather be kidnapped by the Mafiathan have to complete the picture . . .”

And what of the film itself? Unfortunately, Bloodline, the only R-ratedfilm of Audrey’s career, unfolds like the television soap operas Dynasty andDallas, but without the saving grace of the humor that made them guiltypleasures. It’s a full and frustrating fifteen minutes before Audrey appears on-screen, still sporting the curled hair seen in Robin and Marian, her look ac-cessorized by oversized sunglasses. Shot through filters and high-key light-ing, she is given material of little substance to act, and what she is given is ofsuch risible quality that the unthinkable happens: the viewer is embarrassedon Audrey’s behalf. Repellent scenes from snuff movies are repeatedlyshown as part of the plot, and one character’s knees are nailed to the floor,resulting in a violence and tawdriness far worse than anything Audrey couldhave feared from her aborted Alfred Hitchcock film of twenty years earlier,No Bail for the Judge.

Top billed over Ben Gazzara, Omar Sharif, and James Mason, Audrey her-self seems to know that for all the talk of Elizabeth being a successful busi-

ness tycoon, this is just old-fashioned hokum dressed up with sex and viol-ence. It was not only Audrey who was left stranded, however, and in someways her inherent grace allowed her to survive the mess in better fashion thanthe others: Irene Papas is saddled with a bizarrely over-the-top wardrobe,Gert “Goldfinger” Fröbe is on hand as an absent-minded professor, and themovie screeches to a dead halt whenever Michelle Phillips appears. Even thescore by the esteemed Ennio Morricone proves irritating, thundering along asif volume alone could help pump up the dismal proceedings. The entire ex-perience is summed up by the fact that the most interesting scene in the filmhas nothing to do with stopping whoever is trying to murder Elizabeth Rolfe,but rather everything to do with Audrey’s first appearance in a sparklingGivenchy gown. What else could one reasonably expect from a film whereAudrey’s jewels from Bulgari received a credit of their own?

The film flopped at the box office, and reviews were not kind, with the re-ception to Audrey’s participation best summed up by the review in Variety:“Though it would take several pictures on the level of Bloodline to seriouslydamage her stature, it’s a shame she picks something like this now that sheworks so seldom.” Even hard-to-please critics seemed to await Audrey’s rareonscreen appearances with anticipation, which undoubtedly led to the senseof disappointment running through all of the film’s reviews. Added the Vari-ety critic: “It’s a shock to see Hepburn playing a role that even Raquel Welchwould have the good sense to turn down.”

Bloodline did, however, bring Audrey an unexpected romance with her co-star Ben Gazzara. The hyper-masculine Gazzara, one year younger, methodtrained, and unrelentingly intense, provided Audrey with a welcome lift upfrom the doldrums; when in the mood, he could be very charming, and withhis assertiveness and take-no-prisoners attitude, he made Audrey feel protec-ted. In the words of Alexander Walker: “He had the self-absorbed actor’s un-predictability of response and played on it.” For his part, Gazzara was takenwith Audrey’s elegant ladylike exterior: “I never heard a vulgar word comeout of Audrey. I never heard anyone be vulgar in front of Audrey.”

The last, and most humorous, word on that genteel behavior and beautycame from Liza Minnelli after Audrey and Gazzara spent one night duringfilming seeing Minnelli in concert. After compliments and gracious wordswere exchanged backstage and Audrey and Gazzara had departed, Lizaturned to her assistant Bill Thomas and laughingly exclaimed: “That Audrey

bitch was so fat! . . . Have you ever seen anyone thinner or more gorgeous? Ifelt like the ugliest stepsister in the world!”

# Chapter Forty-OneTHEY ALL LAUGHED, 1980

“John Keats wrote, ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty,’ and Audrey was livingproof of that; watching her in a picture was seeing beauty and truth re-vealed at every shimmering moment.”

—director Peter Bogdanovich

GORGEOUS AUDREY WAS. THIN SHE was. But also at loose ends, and more than abit still in love with Ben Gazzara, which is why in 1980 she agreed to staralongside the actor in director Peter Bogdanovich’s comedy/drama They AllLaughed. In a year dominated by blockbusters like Raiders of the Lost Ark,Body Heat, and Halloween, Bogdanovich and Blaine Novak’s screenplay forThey All Laughed, a wry meditation on the foibles of love, represented a riskyproposition. It was, Bogdanovich later explained, his attempt, after the large-scale failure of his Cole Porter musical At Long Last Love (1975), to “acceptthe question I had asked in At Long Last Love: What is falling in love?” Ab-sent any explosions or wild action sequences, the film remained a dubiousprospect for production until Audrey signed on; only then did Bogdanovichsecure financing from Time-Life and begin shooting in April of 1980.

Audrey, for whom Kurt Frings had secured a salary of $\$ 1$ million for sixweeks of work in New York City, would play “Angela Niotes,” a rich Italianindustrialist’s bored wife who unexpectedly falls for “John Russo” (Ben Gaz-zara), a detective specializing in cases of adultery. The La Ronde–like en-semble comedy of mismatched lovers would also co-star television’s JohnRitter and Bogdanovich’s real life love, Playboy model Dorothy Stratten.

Unsurprisingly, Audrey had at first proved reluctant to sign on. Bogdan-ovich tried to interest her by explaining that he had crafted the script specific-ally for her, but, in his telling, she politely replied: “Oh, Peetah! Don’t tell me

that—I’ll feel so baaad if I don’t do it . . . !” Yes, the salary of $\$ 1$ millionhelped, but in the director’s view, Audrey largely agreed to make They AllLaughed because he offered to make Sean, who had left the University ofGeneva, his personal on-set assistant. It was not a mere case of pleasing hisstar, however, because in the director’s own words, Sean “turned out to benot only the best on-set assistant I had ever had, but a damn fine actor in thesupporting role entirely rewritten to suit him.” Sean did indeed prove a pleas-ant onscreen presence, but holding little desire to continue acting, he eventu-ally embarked upon a career in production.

Happy as Audrey was about Sean being a part of the film, and notwith-standing Bogdanovich’s open-hearted admiration—“There’s nobody greaterat a romantic comedy than Audrey Hepburn”—the old doubts about her owntalents persisted, a fact made clear in an interview conducted during the film-ing of the movie: “I’m not Laurence Olivier, no virtuoso talent. I’m basicallyrather inhibited and I find it difficult to do things in front of people. What mydirectors have had in common is that they’ve made me feel secure, made mefeel loved.”

She was always the first to put down her own abilities, doing so more fre-quently than any critics ever could, but the idea of Audrey as a non-actressburst forth most publicly some seventeen years after her death when a sur-prisingly self-serving Emma Thompson, then in the process of writing anever-filmed remake of My Fair Lady proclaimed: “I find Audrey Hepburnfantastically twee—twee is whimsy without wit, it’s mimsy-mumsy sweet-ness without any kind of bite and that’s not for me. . . . She can’t sing and shecan’t act. I’m sure she was a delightful woman—and perhaps if I had knownher I would have enjoyed her acting more but I don’t and I didn’t. I don’t doAudrey Hepburn—I think that’s a guy thing.”

Says Sean Ferrer about the imbroglio: “Emma Thompson—she’s an act-ress and a very good one. She has a very different persona from my mother’s.My mother never criticized Emma or anyone else—in fact, she would havebeen the first to put herself down. All I can think is that Emma Thompsonmust have been going through something tough in her life at the time. To sayshe was mimsy-mumsy—it felt to me like throwing rocks at the Pope. Mymother was not the greatest actress, dancer, or singer, not the most beautifulwoman—but the combination of the high-level skills she did possess, andwho she was as a person—all those qualities in one person made her unique.”

In truth, the criticism was surprising coming from Thompson, who mis-read Hepburn’s persona, missing the fact that she actually appealed to womeneven more than she did to men. The criticism bothered screenwriter FredericRaphael enough that he rushed to the defense of his Two for the Road star,perceptively writing, “Audrey was just a little bit tougher than she seemed.That was her grace and her art and also during the war, her salvation.”

Thompson’s put-down ultimately mattered little, and it is Sean who offersa more nuanced assessment of his mother’s abilities: “My mother was not ofthe ilk or capacity of Katharine Hepburn or Bette Davis. She never claimed tobe. She was an actress but she was also a movie star. To be a star it takes alittle more than being an actress, or being elegant, or being pretty. You haveto wrap it all together with solid performances but when you’re a star on thatlevel it’s also more like a beautiful presentation, not just about the ingredi-ents. . . . My mother transcended the limitations of Hollywood stardom be-cause she ended up with three components to her persona: movie star, icon ofstyle, and her humanitarian work. Inner and outer elegance.

“She started out acting with the older generation, in the studio system thatflourished in the 40s and early 50s, but as the years went by, she also workedin the much more natural way of acting that came out of Europe. She’s notAnna Magnani, but she’s one of the few whose acting transferred from oneworld of filmmaking to the next. Styles used to be very compartmentalized inpeople’s minds, but my mother transcended that and remained as well-knownin one era as in the next. Two for the Road represents a very different style offilmmaking and acting than Sabrina, but she mastered both and is re-membered for both.”

It was Audrey’s own assessment—“it’s not as if I’m the greatest actress.I’m not Bergman”— that proved most interesting, because genuine as thisself-assessment was, she was actually wrong. In the very tough world of Hol-lywood, no actress maintains a decades-long star status without substance toback up the popularity. The camera doesn’t lie, and while many are giftedwith a flash-in-the-pan success, very few sustain stardom over the course ofdecades. Audrey’s status as a worldwide icon was not a case of style oversubstance but rather a unique and winning combination of the two.

Bogdanovich clearly felt very differently than did Emma Thompson, andusing his admiration for Audrey’s talent as a springboard, he wrote the char-acter of Angela specifically for and about her: “Audrey’s backstory in the

movie was very much the real backstory of what was going on in her life.”Analyzing the movie with director West Anderson, Bogdanovich added: “Sheand Ben had had an affair during Bloodline, and I remember Ben comingback to my kitchen in Bel Air later that year and talking to me in my kitchen,saying: “Oh Peter, Peter—I’m in love with Audrey—Audrey, she’s a saint.”

Gazzara, not usually given to such overt emotionalism, had rhapsodizedabout how “lonely and fragile and saintlike she was.” After speaking withGazzara, Bogdanovich then drew upon the specifics of Audrey’s life to createthe character of “Angela,” a woman devoted to her young son who endureslife with an inattentive husband, and in the wake of a failing marriage em-barks upon a brief but fulfilling affair. At movie’s end, Angela leaves NewYork, flying away with her husband and son while true love John Russo re-mains behind—a deliberate echo of Roman Holiday’s Princess Ann choosingroyal duty over love.

In the planning stages, They All Laughed may have sounded like a full-fledged and bittersweet Technicolor romance, but before production began,real life had intervened: while shooting Inchon (1981) immediately afterBloodline, Gazzara had fallen in love with Elke Stuckmann (soon to be histhird wife). Analyzed Gazzara of his time with Audrey: “I was flattered thatsomeone like that would be in love with me. But I didn’t know how deeplyshe was in love with me until after I left. She told others, not me, that I hadbroken her heart. She was so kind and sweet. And I hurt her.”

The relationship between Audrey and Gazzara may have registered as un-certain, but of Bogdanovich’s affection for Audrey there was no doubt. Likenearly all of her previous directors, Bogdanovich found himself completelycharmed by his star: “She was wonderful to work with. She was so unlike amovie star. . . . Never complained. Always knew the lines. Always improvedthe lines. You’d tell her ‘That wasn’t the line’ and she’d say ‘Isn’t that theline? I thought it was—I’ll say what you like.’ And I’d find myself saying‘No, no Audrey—I like your version better.’”

Set in the present-day New York City of 1981, They All Laughed was de-liberately planned by Bogdanovich to feature the casual, modern, Givenchy-less Audrey found in Two for the Road: “All of the clothes that Audrey wearsin the film are her clothes—or imitations of the clothes that she herself wears.She wore blue jeans, silk shirts, and a pea jacket—so when I saw those werethe clothes she wore, I asked her to wear those through the picture and she

did.”

With a minimal crew and no more than ten contracted extras—the crowdsseen on the streets of Manhattan were simply New Yorkers going about theireveryday business—production proved light years removed from Audrey’scosseted studio films of the 1950s. She remained unfazed by the lack of trail-ers and dressing rooms, patiently waiting inside stores until the call wouldcome for the next shot. Enthused Bogdanovich: “Audrey was so wonderful. Iremember her going into a store on $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Avenue where we’d made her wait forthat sequence on $5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Avenue, and she’d come out and say, ‘Oh look, Peter—they gave me this lovely handkerchief.’ And she’d come out of another store,and she’d say, ‘Oh look, Peter—they gave me this lovely umbrella.’ I jokedwith her and said: ‘Ok Audrey—after the next shot you can go to the otherside of the street and work that side of the street.’ She laughed. People justgave her things when they recognized her—and why wouldn’t they?”

To Bogdanovich, Audrey’s Unforgiven co-star Lillian Gish representedthe first “virgin hearth goddess of the screen,” and Audrey the last. In reality,however, Audrey seemed to more directly represent the last true innocent ofthe American screen; after directing Audrey in a bedroom scene with Gaz-zara, even Bogdanovich seemed surprised by the extent of her vulnerability.Although the scene in question proved rather tame in content and duration,the director was struck by one overwhelming element: “I got the impressionshe was pretty desperate for love.” There was, he found, a lingering sadnesssurrounding his star: “She was a survivor, but it was painful. There was asense of lost gaiety around Audrey that she could never quite recapture. I feltthat it was from all the guys who had treated her badly.”

As shooting progressed, Bogdanovich grew increasingly aware of the fra-gility that informed Audrey’s life onscreen and off: “In life you’d think,‘How is she going to get through the day or even the hour?’ Her hands areshaking, she’s smoking too much, she’s worried, she’s being kind of desper-ately nice to everybody, she’s so fragile. . . . But between the time shestepped in front of the camera and you said ‘Action!,’ something happened.She pulled it together. A kind of strength through vulnerability—strength likean iron butterfly.”

She was, he realized, always scared. With all that talent and beauty, whatexactly scared her so much? For starters, it seemed, of not being good

enough. Of needing things to be perfect. Wanting, after the uncertainty of thewar years, to control all situations. Wanting the love of a formidable motherand disappearing father. The irony, of course, lay in the fact that it was thisnearly palpable, often beautiful uncertainty that continued to fuel the audi-ence’s love for her. In Sean’s words: “When she cries, she really is feeling it,really living through it. She is believing—reliving—. . . She’s actually there.And you want to take her in your arms and hug her.”

And while the audience wants to protect Audrey/Angela, and roots for herhappy ending with John/Gazzara, the rooting remains limp for the basic butimportant reason that her character’s supposed onscreen romance with Gaz-zara seems rather tame and lacking in passion. They rarely seem to connect,an imbalance that may be a result of the fact that Audrey was at her best onthe first takes while Gazzara improved with additional takes. In Sean’s onsetobservation: “My mother was already a print on take one: the first and thesecond take were simply extraordinary. . . . Gazzara wasn’t really good inthat movie, or certainly he would have been better several takes later, whenmy mother might be just a bit tired, but Bogdanovich preferred to use mymother’s better takes.”

In fact, the rather tentative romance between Audrey and Ben pales incomparison to the genuinely affectionate relationship Audrey displays withyoung Glenn Scarpelli, who plays her son Michael. Her love of children isimmediately apparent onscreen and warms up an otherwise tepid film.

Audrey finished her part six weeks before the rest of the cast, but at theend of shooting, $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Century Fox pronounced themselves unhappy with thefootage, causing Bogdanovich to buy back the film from the studio and re-lease it himself under the banner of his own Moon Pictures.

It was all for naught, however, because the film could not overcome a ba-sic, foundational problem: in struggling to be three films in one—comedy,drama, and bittersweet romance—it succeeded as none. Audiences remainedconfused, wondering—is the movie intended as a wry meditation on relation-ships? If so, why include the scenes suggesting abusive relationships? Forthat matter, why insert goofy scenes showing the characters roller-skating?

Bogdanovich, always at his best with films set in the past (The Last Pic-ture Show, Paper Moon), seems uneasy with his valentine to present-dayNew York, and the different acting styles of Audrey, Gazzara, and John

Ritter never mesh into a consistent tone. Matters are further complicated byPatti Hansen, who plays a cab driver in the manner of an insinuating Bacall-like Howard Hawks heroine, but registers only as exhausting.

Matters were not helped by the film’s uneven editing, although Seanprovides an interesting take on the rather unusual process involved: “DorothyStratten had died, and Peter was very distraught, understandably. So I helpedBilly Carruth with the editing. In those days there was no digital editing. Youhad a movieola; the cutting room was in the screening room of Peter’s house,where we would watch the day’s work on the big screen. If you look at thefilm, there are a lot of over-the-shoulder shots in conversations, a lot of cross-cuts. We were using the early takes in my mother’s scenes, trying to blendwith later takes of Gazzara.”

By the time of the film’s release in 1981, however, the biggest problemlay in the audience’s knowledge that shortly after the end of principal photo-graphy, Dorothy Stratten had been murdered by her estranged husband PaulSnider. Her character, a sweet and beautiful young woman who comes homeeach night to a suspicious and jealous husband, simply contained too manyuncomfortable parallels to Stratten’s own life for the audience to separate thetwo. Compounding those difficulties was the wistful sadness pervading theentire film, Audrey’s scenes included; the unspoken and not entirely welcomemessage conveyed to the audience seemed to be just how difficult and elusivetrue love always proves to be.

In the end, the film left viewers with the same reaction as did Bloodline:given how infrequently Audrey Hepburn chose to work, it’s unfortunate thatthese pallid vehicles represented the best material available. It proved no sur-prise, then, that the critics were not impressed—what kind of Audrey Hep-burn film did not allow Audrey to speak for the first thirty minutes? SniffedVincent Canby of the New York Times: “Mr. Bogdanovich treats AudreyHepburn so shabbily that if this were a marriage instead of a movie, she’dhave grounds for divorce.” Zeroing in on the film’s uneven tone, he contin-ued: “Any way you look at it—as a comedy, as movie-making, as a financialinvestment—They All Laughed is an immodest disaster. It’s aggressive in itsineptitude. It grates on the nerves like a 78 rpm record played at 33 rpm.”Newsweek summed it up best with a simple declaration that the film represen-ted “an aimless bust, unencumbered by a visual or structural scheme.”

A handful of reviewers in trade publications such as Variety and the Holly-

wood Reporter seemed charmed, and the film subsequently acquired a smallcult following, but box office returns at the time of initial release proved dis-mal, and Bogdanovich lost $\$ 5$ million of his own money. The result was per-sonal bankruptcy.

In later years, Bogdanovich did speak to Audrey about making anotherfilm together, one which would have found her playing the role of an addledleading lady in the backstage farce Noises Off (1992). She passed on the offerand the part was ultimately played by Carol Burnett. It proved a wise moveby Audrey, with the role of a boisterous actress portraying a cleaning lady ina third-rate play not appearing to be a natural for her; in any event, the filmproved a critical and financial flop.

Bogdanovich had not been surprised when she declined the role, sensingthat They All Laughed would prove to be “her last film, which is why I didthe ending as a montage of all those shots of her. I felt it was a farewell tothat Audrey Hepburn. As the helicopter took her away, I thought, ‘The worldis taking her away.” A saddened Bogdanovich philosophized “I had a strongsense that she didn’t really enjoy making pictures anymore. The fun had goneout of it for her. She didn’t think it was important anymore.’”

Always in demand from the press and studios alike, Audrey received dozens of scripts toconsider each year. After starring in sixteen films from 1953 to 1967, she made only five

more films during the next twenty-six years. Among those she turned down were TheTurning Point (1977) and Out of Africa (1985). Photofest.

# Chapter Forty-Two

# MIGHT-HAVE-BEENS, 1950s through 1980s

“It’s a shame to think about what the studio ended up killing for the movie-going audiences: a chance to see Hepburn and Olivier face off as Peter Panand Captain Hook.”

—Rafe Telsch, Cinemablend

GIVEN THE IMPRESSIVE NUMBER OF out-and-out triumphs in Audrey’s career—among her twenty-two starring features she fully stumbled only with GreenMansions, The Unforgiven, Bloodline, and They All Laughed—an in-depthanalysis of her filmography leads to a series of interesting questions regard-ing her career. Since everyone seemed to want in on the Audrey Hepburnfilm business (with the notable oft-times exception of Audrey herself), werethere particular roles that she wanted and did not land? Which opportunitiessounded great on paper only to fizzle in the planning stages? And perhapsmost notably, which movies did she flat out turn down? As it happens, the listof films she was rumored to be considering during both her white-hot years inthe 1950s and early $^ { \prime } 6 0 s$ , as well as throughout her self-imposed retreat from1967 onward, provides a tantalizing glimpse of both “If only” and “Thankgoodness she didn’t.”

# The Early Years Might-Have-Beens

Twelfth Night, with Audrey playing both Viola and Sebastian—to be dir-ected by Joseph Mankiewicz.

L’Aiglon, in which Audrey would have portrayed the tubercular son ofNapoleon and Empress Marie Louise. Proposed director: WilliamWyler. In a 1955 interview Audrey explained: “We hope we can shootL’Aiglon next year in Vienna and Schonbronn.”

Rosalind, based on the James M. Barrie play.

A film version of her Broadway triumph Ondine. Audrey and Mel metwith the English master filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Press-burger (The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus) about the proposed film, butAudrey and Mel were a package deal and, said Powell of Mel: “He hadno warmth, nothing to give. Clever, yes—kind, no.”

St. Joan, to be directed by Otto Preminger, and a role subsequentlyplayed by Jean Seberg. At the time, there was some talk that Audreyturned down this notable role because of Preminger’s refusal to cast MelFerrer as the Dauphin.

Tennessee Williams’s Summer and Smoke. As in The Children’s Hour,Audrey would have taken on the role of a middle-aged schoolteacher ina small town. Such was the enthusiasm over Audrey that both producerHal Wallis and Williams himself flew to Rome to pitch her the movie inperson. Wallis, however, did not want Ferrer as the leading man, therewas disagreement over Givenchy designing Audrey’s wardrobe, and inthe end, the film was made with Laurence Harvey and Geraldine Page inthe starring roles.

Henrik Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, with Mel directing. Financing never ma-terialized.

The Diary of Anne Frank. Scheduling problems and all, the role simplystruck too close to home for Audrey, serving as an unwelcome reminderof her years spent living under Nazi rule.

Peter Pan. A live-action film version of J. M. Barrie’s play about theboy who refuses to grow up. Cukor expressed interest in directing, andthe proposed cast was to include Audrey as Peter and Hayley Mills asWendy, with either Peter Sellers or Laurence Olivier playing the villain-

ous Captain Hook. It all seemed irresistible on paper, but London’sGreat Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, to which Barrie had be-queathed the rights, raised obstacles. So too did the Walt Disney Com-pany, which had released a 1953 animated version and did not wantcompetition in the form of a live-action mounting. With Audrey’s andro-gynous vulnerability, as well as her playful inner spirit so reminiscent ofPeter Pan (think Gregory Peck’s description of her as a “cut up”), theidea struck many as near ideal casting. Perhaps for Audrey the film evenrepresented a chance to recreate a childhood taken from her by the war.It’s a tantalizing near miss, high on the list of “if only” Audrey Hepburnfilm projects, and a shame that such a star-studded possibility slowlydrifted away.

Jane Eyre. Audrey as Jane, playing opposite James Mason as“Rochester.” The idea of Audrey and the equally velvet-voiced Masonexchanging dialogue straight out of Charlotte Brontë was enough tomake any Anglophile swoon, but the film never progressed beyond theproposal stage. Perhaps it was because, as Mason himself smartly ob-served: “Audrey Hepburn just happened to be the most beautiful womanin movies. A head-turner. The whole point about Jane was that no onenoticed her when she came into a room or left it.”

In the first iteration of the Audrey Hepburn–Julie Andrews mash-up,Audrey turned down a proposed 1950s English-language remake of theGerman-language Die Trapp Familie. That film’s story of a singingfamily led by a former nun would emerge onscreen in 1965 as TheSound of Music, starring Julie Andrews.

The Doctor’s Dilemma (1958). Based upon the George Bernard Shawplay, the film was to be directed by Anthony Asquith. As was to happenwith some frequency, after Audrey turned down the lead opposite DirkBogarde, her role was assumed by Leslie Caron.

A Certain Smile (1958). This intergenerational soap opera romancewould have found Audrey engaged to a law student but carrying on anaffair with his uncle. Joan Fontaine and Rossanno Brazzi ultimatelystarred in a highly forgettable film notable only for the title tune sung byJohnny Mathis.

# Midcareer Might-Have-Beens

West Side Story (1961). A fortunate refusal. At the time of casting,Audrey was pregnant with son Sean but surely must have understoodthat whatever her formidable acting talents, she would have been unbe-lievable in the extreme as a Puerto Rican teenager. The role of “Maria”in this Academy Award–winning Best Picture went instead to theequally non-Hispanic Natalie Wood.

A Taste of Honey (1961). Based upon the award-winning play byShelagh Delaney, the script broke new ground in its depiction of teenagepregnancy, homosexuality, and interracial friendships. Audrey’s interestin films exploring societal change would ultimately find expression twoyears later when she reunited with director William Wyler for The Chil-dren’s Hour.

The Cardinal (1963). Based upon the best-selling novel by Henry Mor-ton Robinson, Audrey would have played the sister of a handsomeAmerican cardinal portrayed by Tom Tryon. Representing another at-tempt to team Audrey with director Otto Preminger, the film went on toreceive several Academy Award nominations. Audrey’s role was ulti-mately played by Carol Lynley.

In the Cool of the Day (1963). Audrey’s good sense prevailed, and shequickly turned down the role of Christine Bonner, an emotionallyscarred young woman having an affair with her husband’s best friend.Jane Fonda, who ultimately starred in the film, has publicly stated that itwas the worst film of her career, one she wishes had never been made.

The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964). Audrey was asked to play the roleof “Madame Emery,” mother of Catherine Deneuve, in the acclaimedthrough-sung musical directed by Jacques Demy. Her role was ulti-mately played by Anne Vernon.

The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). Preoccupied with both Charadeand the looming My Fair Lady, and fearing a long location shoot,Audrey remained uninterested in playing the role of “Veronica” inGeorge Stevens’s retelling of the story of Jesus. Scheduled to be filmedin three months, the movie ultimately took nine months to shoot, withthe role of Veronica undertaken by Carroll Baker.

Hawaii (1966). A second casting crossover between Audrey and JulieAndrews. Based upon the monumental bestseller by James Michener,Hawaii’s leading female role, that of missionary wife Jerusha Bromley,would have necessitated months of location shooting. With son Seanonly six years old at the time, Audrey never seriously considered takingon the role.

Anxious to establish her dramatic credits after the one-two musical tri-umphs of Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews signedon instead. Given how often the two actresses were mentioned for thesame role, what, one also wonders, could the sometimes-androgynouslooking Audrey have done with Andrews’s Oscar-nominated role as Vic-tor/Victoria? With Andrews’s part as Queen Clarisse Renaldi in thePrincess Diaries movies? How would Julie have fared in Audrey’s roleas “Hap” the angel in Steven Spielberg’s Always?

# And On Through the Years

A Thousand Summers. At times, the lengths to which some would go inorder to secure Audrey’s participation proved jaw-dropping; writer/dir-ector Garson Kanin (Born Yesterday, Adam’s Rib, My Favorite Wife)declared that he would give away the film rights to his novel A Thou-sand Summers if the purchaser would guarantee that Audrey would playthe leading role of a diplomat’s wife engaged in a romance with a coun-try pharmacist. The prescription remained unfilled.

Romeo and Juliet (1968). Directed by Franco Zeffirelli. With her tender-ness, vulnerability, and iron will, Audrey would have made an intriguingJuliet, but she was thirty-nine at the time, and when she evinced no in-terest in the film, Zeffirelli reversed direction and cast the twenty-two-years-younger Olivia Hussey to great acclaim.

The Survivors (1969). Based upon a Harold Robbins potboiler, the soapyplot did not interest Audrey, who was then in the first years of a self-im-posed retirement; the story ultimately surfaced on television with LanaTurner starring as the matriarch of a rich Wall Street family.

Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969). A musical remake of the 1939 classic wasbruited about as a possible co-starring vehicle for Audrey and RichardBurton. Cary Grant, with whom she had successfully co-starred inCharade six years earlier, was mentioned as another possible co-star forAudrey. Press items reported that Audrey would receive $\$ 1$ million totake on the role of a former musical hall singer turned schoolmaster’swife. In the end, Audrey decided that she did not want to make anothermusical so soon after My Fair Lady, and the film was ultimately castwith Peter O’Toole and Petula Clark. Yet another attempt to cash in onthe success of The Sound of Music, the film failed at the box office.

Father’s Day (1971), a comedy/drama about divorce, would have foundAudrey playing a divorced woman alongside Elizabeth Taylor. ShirleyMacLaine and Anne Bancroft were mentioned for other roles but thestudios decided against filming a one-night Broadway flop, and themovie was never produced.

Jackpot (1971) was to be directed by Audrey’s old friend TerenceYoung. Audrey dropped out when she became pregnant with her second

son, Luca. She was replaced by Charlotte Rampling (after leading manRichard Burton first asked Sophia Loren to take on the leading role). Itproved a fortunate turn of events for both Audrey and Sophia, as theproducers ran out of money after shooting commenced, and the film wasabandoned midstream.

Nicholas and Alexandra (1971). Based upon the highly successful bookof the same name by Robert Massie, and with a screenplay by the Oscar-winning (The Lion in Winter) James Goldman, Nicholas and Alexandrawas seriously considered by Audrey. With gowns, jewels, court intrigue,and a tragic death at the hands of a revolutionary firing squad, the role ofCzarina Alexandra of Russia held juicy dramatic possibilities. Audrey,however, had doubts about whether she was age appropriate for the role,and when coupled with the fact that the film would be shot inYugoslavia and Russia, and not Rome where she was then living, she re-gretfully turned down the film. British actress Janet Suzman landed therole and garnered an Academy Award nomination for her efforts.

40 Carats (1973) would have starred Audrey as Anne Stanley, an up-scale New York City realtor and “older woman” of forty, who is ro-manced by a younger man. Based upon the hit Broadway play of thesame name, 40 Carats was to co-star Edward Albert, the son of her Ro-man Holiday castmate Eddie Albert. William Wyler was slated to direct,and Audrey remained interested until the producers refused to film inRome. When Audrey dropped out, so too did Wyler, and the film wasultimately and unmemorably produced with Liv Ullmann in the starringrole and direction by Milton Katselas.

Family Portrait in an Apartment (1974) was slated as an onscreen re-union with Burt Lancaster in a film to be directed by critical favoriteLuchino Visconti. Hollywood columnists mentioned the film as a nearcertainty, with syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners explaining at thetime that Audrey’s decision to once again make movies had grown outof a discussion among her entire family. Husband Andrea Dotti, Man-ners reported, “has great admiration for her talent, their children are oldenough not to need a mother’s constant care, and besides, who ever saidit’s not fun being married to an active movie star?” Lancaster hadalready worked with Visconti on The Leopard (1963), and after The Un-forgiven was eager to work again with Audrey, but while the film (even-

tually retitled Conversation Piece) reunited Lancaster and Visconti,Audrey, as usually happened at this point in her life, simply decidedagainst a return to acting.

A Bridge Too Far (1974), a World War II epic set in Audrey’s nativeNetherlands. Audrey was approached about playing Kate ter Horst, theDutch mother who turned her home just outside of Arnhem into a hos-pital for the Allies. Everything about the film rang too close to Audrey’sown childhood memories of wartime violence; given her refusal to evenwatch war movies with her sons, the chances remained nonexistent thatshe would spend months of her life filming a war movie, let alone oneset in her childhood backyard.

Lumiere (1976), a film which Jeanne Moreau wrote expressly forAudrey. When Audrey declined the role of Sarah, a forty-ish actress liv-ing in Provence, Moreau played the role herself.

The Merry Widow, to be directed by Ingmar Bergman. After proposedfilms with Otto Preminger and Luchino Visconti never materialized,Audrey was keen to work with the esteemed Bergman. She did not,however, like Bergman’s script any more than she did the idea of shoot-ing in Vienna while her young son Luca remained in Rome. Bergmansubsequently approached Barbra Streisand, who liked the first half of thescript but wanted the second half rewritten. Bergman declined, and thefilm was never produced.

Out of Africa (1985). Approached to star in an adaptation of IsakDinesen’s Out of Africa (at that point titled Silence Will Speak), Audreyfound the idea appealing enough to ask her friend Anna Cataldi, whohad written the first draft of the film, to meet with her agent Kurt Frings.Said Cataldi of the meeting with Frings: “That was awful. He said ‘Youwant to put my client in a stupid adventure movie? Forget it. Audreywill never do another movie.’” In the end, Cataldi ended up with a pro-ducer’s credit when Silence Will Speak, retitled Out of Africa, wasfilmed with Meryl Streep, and went on to win the Academy Award forBest Picture. Says Sean: “My mother did later say to me that perhapsshe should have done Out of Africa.”

# Never Talked About but Should Have Been

Audrey as Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby. With her throaty voiceso full of hidden meanings, one can, even now, hear Audrey ruefullymurmuring: “Rich girls don’t marry poor boys, Jay Gatsby.”

A return to the theatre as the “Stage Manager” in Thornton Wilder’s OurTown. Given her own life and personal philosophy, Audrey seemed toembody Wilder’s thematic underpinnings that the aspects of daily lifewe take for granted represent the most precious parts of our lives.

# Interesting Might-Have-Beens

No Bail for the Judge, to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock for a 1959 re-lease. Audrey would have starred as a lawyer working undercover as aprostitute in order to solve a murder involving her barrister father. Thechance to work with Hitchcock intrigued Audrey and a contract wassigned, but upon reading the completed script and realizing that she wasto be nearly raped and strangled, she abruptly lost interest. With a fullyexecuted contract already in place, it seemed impossible for Audrey toleave the film, but her subsequent pregnancy provided a loophole, asHitchcock would have been forced to delay filming until Audrey hadfully recovered from the birth of her child. This projected delay madethe film impossible from both a scheduling and financial standpoint, andthe production was permanently canceled.

Audrey’s aversion to violence was certainly the single biggest reason why thefilm was canceled, but other elements played a part as well: governmentalpowers in London told Paramount that the script’s focus on prostitution rancounter to UK laws banning solicitation, and as a result, they would not allowlocation shooting in London. Leading man Laurence Harvey also droppedout, but a thoroughly dismayed Hitchcock continued to blame Audrey for thecancellation.

In later years, Audrey mused to Sean that perhaps she should have donethe film with as great a director as Hitchcock, but it’s also likely that star anddirector might never have fully meshed. Analyzing Audrey’s dislike of Hitch-cock films, Robbie Wolders commented: “She thought they were too cyn-ical.”

Kurt Frings proposed a sequel to Roman Holiday in which Audrey, nowQueen Ann, and Gregory Peck, now a best-selling author, reconnectwhen her daughter and his son fall in love. However, the underlyingrights proved to be extremely tangled, and the idea fell apart.

# Most Intriguingly of All

The Turning Point (1977). In a literate script by Arthur Laurents,Audrey would have played an aging prima ballerina who is replacedprofessionally by the daughter of her old friend (Shirley MacLaine). Setin the dance world that Audrey still loved, the film’s mixture of balletand romance, as well as the conflict between career and family, in-trigued Audrey. However, she felt that at forty-eight she was too old forthe part, and it was eventually played by Anne Bancroft. Son Sean shedlight on Audrey’s decision: “She loved the Turning Point script. But thefilm came along when she was feeling insecure after the breakup of hersecond marriage and she said to me that she was ‘too young to be agrandmother but too old to be the love interest.’ She no longer had thesupport system of discussing possible films with my father—that collab-oration no longer existed. After seeing the film, she felt that Anne Ban-croft did a terrific job, but that she also could have been very effective.”

A critical and box office success, The Turning Point was ultimately nomin-ated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

# Television

At the time of Gigi, Audrey was asked to portray Gertrude Lawrence onEd Sullivan’s Toast of the Town television show. Lawrence’s life storywas eventually filmed as Star! with Julie Andrews in the leading role.Released in 1968 as the hoped for successful follow-up to The Sound ofMusic, Star! featured a hodgepodge of story and song which interestedfew, and the film bombed at the box office.

Asked to star in a three-part television movie entitled The Place to Be(1979), Audrey seriously considered the offer, but NBC wanted her tosign a contract which included a provision for the movie to be turnedinto a weekly series. Uninterested in such a long-term commitment(which in any event never materialized), Audrey said no, and the rolewas played by Donna Reed.

The Thorn Birds (1983). A highly publicized television “event” basedupon the sprawling best-selling Colleen McCullough novel about life onan Australian ranch. Audrey turned down the role of family matriarchMary Carson in the eight-hour miniseries because it would be shot inHollywood, and Luca, not yet a teenager, was still living in Rome. Theprime-time smash went on to score record high ratings, and BarbaraStanwyck, who played the role of Mary Carson, won an Emmy Award.

# Theatre

After working with Peter Bogdanovich on They All Laughed, there was sometalk of Audrey returning to the theatre for the first time in thirty years, star-ring in a Bogdanovich-directed production of Noël Coward’s Private Lives.The plan never came to fruition, nor did the idea of a film of Coward’s HayFever co-starring Audrey and Michael Caine.

The idea of another Noël Coward stage production, Blithe Spirit, was alsofloated, and would have featured Audrey taking on the role of the dotty clair-voyant Madame Arcati. When Bogdanovich remarked that Margaret Ruther-ford had played that role, Hepburn smilingly replied: “Yes. She knew whatthe best part was.” Bogdanovich may have been surprised by Audrey’s in-terest in a role so different from those she normally played, but, he relayed,“she saw herself in it quite clearly.” A hit 2009 Broadway revival of thissure-fire crowd pleaser saw Angela Lansbury win a fifth Tony Award forplaying Madame Arcati, proof positive that Audrey’s theatrical instincts re-mained undiminished.

There was simply no one else like her, a point underscored when millionsof dollars were spent trying to recreate her star quality in both Audrey Hep-burn biopics and feature film remakes of her greatest hits. To which the onlypossible reaction remained: Why?

# ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES, 1987–2002

“Sydney Pollack’s newly opened rehash of Sabrina seems not only super-fluous but also painfully contrived.”

—Michael H. Price, Fort Worth Star-Telegram

SUCH WAS THE DAZZLING EFFECT that Audrey had upon audiences from RomanHoliday right up through Wait Until Dark, that for the next sixty years Holly-wood scrambled repeatedly and rather desperately to replicate her charm.Every one of the efforts was doomed to failure for the simple reason that noone stopped to analyze the one immutable truth at the heart of the enterprise:you can’t clone a unique persona.

Exhibit number 1: a pedestrian 1987 television remake of Roman Holidaystarring Catherine Oxenberg, a real-life Yugoslavian princess. The film mightas well have carried the subtitle “just because you’re a real princess playing aprincess, doesn’t mean it will work . . .” Tom Conti and Ed Begley Jr. in theGregory Peck and Eddie Albert roles fared slightly better, but it all provedbland in the extreme. A hopeless undertaking from the get-go, it remains re-miniscent of nothing so much as the extraordinarily unnecessary remake ofBen-Hur three decades later. Faced with these inferior remakes, audiences,understandably enough, had exactly one question: Why bother?

A 1995 remake of Sabrina directed by the estimable Sydney Pollack andstarring Julia Ormond fell equally flat, and the presence of Harrison Ford andGreg Kinnear in the Bogart and William Holden roles made little difference.Kinnear came off the best of the trio by not forcing the issue, but Ormond re-gistered as merely pleasant and vaguely charming, devoid of the necessarysparkle. She’s beautiful, possesses a certain elegance and charm, and seemsable to act, but she can’t make it work. There is nothing in the least ethereal

about Julia Ormond, and that lack flattens out the fable-like quality of theCinderella story. Billy Wilder even came on board as a “consultant,” but hisidea that the screenplay should feature a bankrupt Larrabee company, withSabrina’s competition for David Larrabee’s affections being the daughter of aprospective Japanese corporate raider, was ignored.

Wilder and Pollack did have lunch together, a meal during which Wilderprovided an unasked-for review of Pollack’s Oscar-winning Out of Africa:“That Africa movie you made—classy but boring.” (Asked by Wilder howmany Oscars he had won, Pollack replied “two,” only to have Billy immedi-ately shoot back: “I’ve got six.”) Unlike Out of Africa, however, Pollack’s re-make of Sabrina proved no Oscar winner, and Wilder’s distaste for the fin-ished film was revealed in a conversation with director Cameron Crowe re-garding remakes of his best-known films. After listening to a stranger’s pitchabout a proposed remake of Sunset Boulevard, Wilder offhandedly confidedin Crowe: “Would Elizabeth Taylor be a good substitute for a new version ofSunset Boulevard, filmed against a fifties background? I have no idea!! I’msure she would be no better or worse than the actress who played AudreyHepburn in the remake of Sabrina.”

In the end, this new version of Sabrina registered as nothing so much as apro forma by-the-numbers copy. Ormond, who was touted in advance as thenext big Hollywood star, never really recovered.

It proved the same story when Thandie Newton took on the role of ReginaLambert in The Truth about Charlie (2002), a very loose retelling of Charade(as well as partial homage to Truffaut’s Shoot the Piano Player). It didn’thelp matters that Newton had Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role, lightcharm not being Wahlberg’s strong suit. Audiences remained resolutely unin-terested.

Having failed with motion picture remakes of classic Audrey titles, Holly-wood decided to take an even more direct step in 2000, with Jennifer LoveHewitt starring in the made-for-television The Audrey Hepburn Story. A slav-ish copy of the milestones in Audrey’s life, it ultimately possessed little ac-tual life itself, and audiences remained as indifferent to Hewitt playing Hep-burn as they were to Nicole Kidman playing Princess Grace in 2014’s Graceof Monaco.

Oxenberg, Ormond, Newton, and Love Hewitt—not without talent, butrather than float effortlessly, all four strode purposefully. The necessary quo-

tient of magic was nowhere to be found.

# Chapter Forty-Four

# WITH AND WITHOUT—LIFE WITH FATHER

# (AND MOTHER), 1929–1984

“I know my mother always used to say, ‘Good things aren’t supposed tojust fall in your lap. God is very generous, but he expects you to do yourpart first.’ So you have to make that effort.”

—Audrey Hepburn

WHEN BEN GAZZARA HAD PROFESSED his love, only to disappoint and ultimatelydisappear, it all reopened wounds which had never fully healed, remindingAudrey once again that her father had neither attempted to contact her at theend of the war nor thought to even inquire about her welfare. Recollectingthat difficult time decades later, Audrey said with tears in her eyes: “Butmaybe he didn’t want to see me. His sense of discretion. . . . Perhaps I don’twant to talk about it.”

In a neat bit of self-analysis Audrey explained: “I do think there are things,experiences in childhood, that form you for the rest of your life,” but it wasSean who summed up her fragile psyche with the greatest perception: “Well,she had feelings for all of us, yet she was never able to let go of her emotionsor find peace within herself. She was truly scared on some level. The aban-donment of her father was a wound that never truly healed. She never reallytrusted that love would stay.”

In an attempt to heal that lingering wound, it was Mel who had, in theearly 1960s, tracked down Joseph Ruston through the Red Cross. FindingJoseph in Ireland, Mel called him and arranged a private meeting betweenfather and daughter at the famed Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin. Any fantasiesAudrey might have still retained about a loving reunion with her father van-ished in the face of the emotionally unavailable man she encountered. Said

Sean about his mother’s reaction: “I think she really hoped that like in a fairytale he would jump from the seat in the hotel in Dublin with tears in his eyesand that would make up for what had happened. Instead, her father barely ac-knowledged her. She knew as soon as she saw him. I think she was devast-ated.” It is a viewpoint echoed by Audrey’s close friend John Isaac: “Whenshe was telling me the story she was crying. She said he was so cold. He didnot receive her. That really hurt her.”

Writing further about the reunion in his own book, Sean explained: “Ittook my mother only a fraction of a second to understand. The man wasfrozen. He couldn’t take a step, or lift an arm, let alone hug her. Not becauseof too much emotion—he was totally disconnected, as he had been for mostof his life.” The entire tale is summed up by a picture of Audrey with herfather which appears in the family-approved Audrey Hepburn Treasures.Side by side with her father, she is smiling broadly, while he simply staresstraight ahead at the camera. On the day of the reunion, when Mel returned tothe Shelbourne at the agreed-upon time, Audrey simply told him: “We can gohome now.”

And yet, relates Sean, the reunion nonetheless created a sense of closure:“She realized it wouldn’t have made a huge difference if he had been presentin her life. He was an emotionally scarred man who couldn’t express emotionand he never could have been the kind of father she wanted him to be. Sherealized that he was an emotional invalid, that he couldn’t—he just didn’thave the ability. She accepted it and that created closure. . . . She made peacewith the whole experience.”

So fractured had the relationship between father and daughter beenthroughout the years that it does raise the question of whether the rift hadbeen made worse by Ella. Hepburn biographer Alexander Walker points outthat Joseph himself claimed that throughout Audrey’s childhood he had senther letters which were never reciprocated, but also never returned to sender.If the letters had reached the intended address, had Ella intercepted the let-ters? Had she hoped to keep her daughter from suffering further disappoint-ment in the face of James’s unreliable nature?

At one point Joseph did state that Audrey sent him a telegram at Christmasof 1954, and that he had in fact visited La Paisible in later years. That claim isborne out by the recollection of Sean: “I did meet my grandfather when hecame to Switzerland. I must have been five or six years old. He was a very

serious man, very elegantly dressed—he wore a very nice, slightly tatteredtweed jacket.”

In the end, father and daughter did have intermittent contact after the diffi-cult visit at the Shelbourne Hotel, and Audrey wrote him a letter in March of1963 in which she talks of their too-long separation and how upset she wasthat her grandmother had given an interview about her to an Austrian news-paper: “I was terribly shocked to be somehow commercialized by my owngrandmother at a time when I desperately wanted to be loved for myself.”

For Audrey, such matters of the heart remained personal and not for publicconsumption. She undoubtedly would have been even more upset by the2003 auction of a letter she wrote to her stepmother Fidelma in July 1980during the last months of her father’s life. Offered for sale by the RendellGallery in New York City, the letter is a rather open-hearted declaration ofemotion by the fifty-one-year-old Audrey: “I have been struggling to find away to come to see Daddy—but everything always happens at once! Mymother is very ill too—I have been nursing her day and night, her heart isvery bad and she has just had a third stroke. Added to all this my marriage isin bad shape so am suffering on all sides. I can only do the best I can.”

Disappointment and all, Audrey quietly sent her father monthly checks forthe final twenty years of his life. When word reached her that her father wasdying, she did travel to Dublin once again, this time with Robert Wolders.Wolders related that Audrey found it “wonderfully ironic” that after a life-time of looking down upon those of other races, her father was now beingtaken care of by a doctor from India. Even on his deathbed, however, this re-mote, austere man could not express any emotions to his daughter, talking in-stead about his horses. In Wolders’s words: “It was very odd because he wason his deathbed, and when she went in to see him, she came out very dis-heartened—he had nothing really to say. And then he asked to see me. Andthen—and this was so miraculous—he proceeded to talk about Audrey andhow proud he was of her. He knew I would be the conduit and that I wouldtell her, which I was more than happy to do.”

His true feelings, it seemed, could only be expressed to and through oth-ers, only now able to explain “how much she meant to him, how he regrettednot having been more of a father figure, and how proud he was of her.”

Joseph Hepburn-Ruston died on October 16, 1980, at age ninety. The fu-neral was private, but in the view of Robbie Wolders, Audrey had by then

made peace with her father’s shortcomings: “What’s important is that she hadno bitterness toward him . . . She didn’t hate him for his fascism, but she be-came what she was in reaction to it.” As she told the New York Times: “I havehatred for no one, I must say. You can’t if you have any common sense at all.You can hate any individual for what he or she does, but then we have to hateourselves as well.”

Just as her drive grew out of her father’s absence, part of Audrey’s self-ef-facement certainly seems to have stemmed from her complicated relationshipwith her mother. On the one hand, Audrey realized that without Ella’s con-stant stage mother determination, she may not have accomplished all that shehad on stage and screen. On the other, Ella’s inability to express affection re-mained a constant frustration for her daughter. Only to others would Ellapraise her daughter, albeit in a rather backhanded fashion; meeting CecilBeaton at the time of My Fair Lady, she blithely told him that her daughter“lived on her nerves but was never any trouble: She just floats through lifeand learns everything herself.”

Yes, it’s praise, but being described as “never any trouble” is praise of arather muted sort. This, after all, was a mother who commented upon herdaughter’s huge initial successes in Roman Holiday and Sabrina by exclaim-ing: “Considering that you have no talent, it’s really extraordinary whereyou’ve got.” Some young women would have crumpled under that smilingassault, but Audrey did not even feel her mother was putting her down, butrather helping to nudge her toward success: “And that’s what I really believeto this day. I’ve always been self-conscious about interviews, about my thin-ness, my tallness, my unattractiveness. My success—it still bewilders me.”

Pressed by a television interviewer about her mother calling her an uglyduckling, Audrey appeared startled and then smiled: “The ugly ducklinggrows into a swan—which didn’t happen to me.” To others she may haverepresented beauty and grace of the highest order, but in Audrey’s own eyes,she remained an ugly duckling. The end result of Ella’s edgy ugly ducklingput-down? Audrey’s smiling determination to show her mother that she wastalented and deserving of both recognition and love.

It was, however, more than Ella’s ill-chosen words and 1930s embrace offascism that bothered her daughter throughout the decades. Instead, in thewords of Funny Face screenwriter Leonard Gershe, who knew both women,it was Ella’s natural inclination to walk into a room feeling superior to others

that “embarrassed Audrey, who was exactly the opposite, and that was an-other one of the walls between them.”

Whatever the conflicts between Audrey and Ella, and no matter the com-plications attached thereto, a loving bond nonetheless persisted, with Ellaeven moving into La Paisible in the latter part of her life. Explains Sean: “Mygrandmother lived in San Francisco until the 1980s when she couldn’t livealone any longer. Unfortunately, in an attempt to save money, she did not re-new her health insurance, so my mother had to pay for all of her medicalcare. She lived with us for the last ten years of her life.” Ruminating further,Sean forthrightly explained: “It was strenuous when my grandmother came tolive with my mother. How shall I put this? Their personalities were not wellsuited.”

While she remained in good health, Ella managed the staff at La Paisible,and for all of her aristocratic exterior—in Sean’s words Ella remained a“grande dame from another century”—she did prove a welcome, even excit-ing grandmotherly presence for the then still young Luca: “Ella was fantasticas a person. I grew up with her and I loved her. For a boy growing up, shewas more fun than anything.” Austere with Audrey, Ella proved anything butfor her young grandson: “Ella was terrifying! When she would tell a creepystory, you would shake all night and love it, and ask her to tell it again thenext day.”

Whatever Audrey’s problems with her mother, Ella had influenced hergreatly, and nowhere more strongly than in Ella’s insistence that even withher extraordinary worldwide fame, Audrey was no different, and certainly nobetter, than anyone else: “Never let yourself grow up believing that . . . any-body is any different from anybody else . . . we’re all the same.” It was ad-vice Audrey carried with her for the rest of her life, and when the twenty-year-old Sean was leaving home in 1980 to work on the Terence Young filmInchon, Audrey put him on the plane with advice Sean remembers well:“Everybody is expendable and replaceable. So don’t ever believe otherwise.Treat that job as if it’s your last job and the most important one.”

Audrey had lost her brothers Alex and Ian in 1979 and 2010, respectively(Alex’s wife Miepje lived until 2006), but when Ella died on August 26,1984, at age eighty-four, Audrey’s reaction was one of gratitude for the extratime they had spent together in the last years of her mother’s life: “I was verylucky to be able to take care of her, because I always think it’s so sad when

people have to die away from home.”

In the end, said Sean, a definite bond existed between Ella and Audrey:“Close is not the way to describe it but they were tied to each other. Theykept this daily pressure on each other. They had survived the war together . . .and when you go through something like that with whomever, you are shar-ing that for the rest of your life.” Ella’s death was, Audrey acknowledged, adevastating reversal: “I was lost without my mother. She had been my sound-ing board, my conscience. She was not the most affectionate person—in factthere were times I thought she was cold—but she loved me in her heart, and Iknew that all along.”

# Chapter Forty-FiveLOVE AMONG THIEVES, 1987

“Television’s fast production pace is difficult but maybe it’s better thatway; you don’t have time to think about things and ruin them!”

—Audrey Hepburn

AFTER ELLA’S DEATH, AUDREY DID make a brief return to the world of movieswith a “talking head” appearance in 1986’s fifty-eight-minute documentaryDirected by William Wyler. The film, which featured her smiling recollectionof how she had been scared into tears by Wyler on Roman Holiday, had beenwell received, was shown at film festivals and on Public Broadcasting Sys-tem’s American Masters television series, and even won honors at theChicago Film Festival. But Audrey’s appearance had been as blink-and-you’ll-miss-her brief as those put in by other boldface names ranging fromBette Davis and Greer Garson to Laurence Olivier and Barbra Streisand, allof them eager to pay tribute to the famed director.

Now, however, with Sean age twenty-seven and Luca seventeen, Audreyacknowledged that it was not imperative she always stay at home, and shebegan perusing the scripts still continually coming her way. Although she didnot land the role of New York society matron Alice Grenville in the televi-sion adaptation of her friend Dominick Dunne’s The Two Mrs. Grenvilles(the role was played by Claudette Colbert), when the light romantic caperHere a Thief, There a Thief was proposed as a made-for-television movie, shesaid yes with little hesitation. Her co-star? The very popular Tom Selleck,then in the midst of an eight-year run in the hit CBS television series Mag-num P.I.

When Selleck’s participation proved impossible to schedule, an offer wasmade to Audrey’s Gstaad friend and neighbor Robert Wagner. Recalls Wag-

ner: “When Tom Selleck’s participation didn’t work out they came to me,and I jumped at it right away! I had known Audrey a long time—I actuallymet her when she first came to America. I was at Paramount working withSpencer Tracy on Broken Lance (1954) and she was working on Sabrina. Iinstantly liked her—in fact I adored her. Through the years I remained a bigadmirer of her work.”

A devoted fan of Wagner’s hit television series Hart to Hart, Audreywarmed to the idea of working with her friend in what she hoped would be aromantic caper in the vein of his earlier, popular series To Catch a Thief.Bolstered by a salary of $\$ 750,000$ , her role as classical pianist Baroness Car-oline DuLac seemed to fit her own dictum that she would work again if it was“going to be fun, something cheerful.” The picaresque plot featured the bar-oness stealing a Fabergé egg in order to save her kidnapped fiancé—and ohyes, somewhere in the midst of shootouts and concertizing, Caroline wouldbe thwarted, saved, and romanced by the shadowy if attractive Mike Cham-bers (Wagner).

The plot did not bear close scrutiny, but all involved hoped that charmwould rule the day. Audrey was game, not to mention top billed over Wagnerand Jerry Orbach, but time away from the screen had not dimmed her self-de-precating take on her abilities: “I’m not a born actress, as such, but I careabout expressing feelings.” Co-star Wagner saw Audrey’s talent in a muchdifferent light, enthusing: “Working with Audrey was one of the big high-lights of my career. I thought she was a really exceptional actress. She washer own person, and her acting was an extension of that—she could accessher own feelings. Incredibly professional. She was terrific.”

If Audrey had found the filming of Robin and Marian rushed, it wasdownright leisurely in comparison to the August 1986 shoot for (the since-re-titled) Love Among Thieves, a lightning-fast twenty-two days in Tucson, Hol-lywood, San Francisco, and the mountains of Dulce Agua, California. SaidWagner: “Fortunately we had rehearsed ahead of time, and we also had a ter-rific producer in Robert Papazian.” The fast-paced schedule seemed to be re-flected in the fact that Audrey did a lot of running throughout the movie; allthat brisk walking in the Swiss Alps had served her well, but the plot was, toput it charitably, even weaker on film than on the page, with any chance ofemotional involvement undercut by the comically evil stalker essayed byJerry Orbach.

As happened with Bloodline, during Love Among Thieves’s slow patches,the main point of interest lies in Audrey’s wardrobe. Although for most of therunning time she is shown wearing one bland shirtwaist style dress, there aretwo Givenchy gowns onscreen during the opening and concluding scenes.The gowns are beautiful and Givenchy has not lost his touch, although onedoes idly wonder why a classical pianist would wear a hat throughout herconcert. Said Wagner of the 1 a.m. filming of that concert scene in San Fran-cisco’s City Hall: “It was electric. When Audrey came to work, those twohundred people in the audience stood up and applauded before she even satdown at the piano. She was so beautiful. Such a marvelous, wonderful, wo-man.”

As for the movie itself, Audrey proved a warm presence throughout, andWagner, the star of three hit television series, remained a past master at pleas-ing an audience. The mechanics of the plot often proved forgettable, how-ever, and while it was nice to see that Audrey could still float down imposingstaircases with unearthly grace, the contrivances added up to a feeling thattime had passed the genre by. In the end, Love Among Thieves registered as ajunior varsity version of Charade, and while none of it was terrible, neitherdid any of it prove memorable.

When the film aired on February 23, 1987, the pairing of movie legendAudrey and television favorite Wagner proved a potent ratings draw. Re-views, however, were poor, with the New York Post, seemingly affronted bya lightweight television movie, loudly calling it “an unfortunate travesty.”None of the harshness was directed at the two stars, and by this time critics,like the public, were simply glad for the chance to see Audrey once again onfilm; John O’Connor, writing in the New York Times, seemed to sum up thepervading feeling by writing: “Miss Hepburn, still lovely, though even morefragile than usual . . . deserves several more [Givenchy gowns] in a range ofcolors for having to trudge through this turkey.”

Co-star Wagner continued his decades-long friendship with Audrey wellafter filming had wrapped: “I would see her a great deal—in Hollywood atConnie Wald’s house, and in Switzerland with Julie Andrews and Blake Ed-wards. I loved her very much—she was one of the most extraordinary womenI’ve ever known and Robbie Wolders, whom I’d known since he was undercontract to Universal, was a very good person as well—a polite, genuinelynice man who was wonderful to Audrey. She was just such a good person,

and her humanity was reflected in everything she did—in her clothes, herhome, her flowers, her dogs and especially her children. I was not surprisedin the least when she devoted herself to UNICEF—that’s the kind of womanshe was. She devoted so much of herself to that cause. In fact, she gave ofherself so fully that I feel it affected her health and took a toll on her. Therewas so much travel and under such difficult conditions. But—she would doanything to help children all around the world.”

Audrey had enjoyed herself making Love Among Thieves, and the film,whether critically acclaimed or not, had reintroduced her to tens of millionsof viewers. But any lingering professional concern about Love AmongThieves soon vanished, because Audrey Hepburn was about to embark uponthe hardest work and greatest achievement of her life.

“It’s ironic that it was because of children that I stayed home all theseyears. Now it is for the sake of the children that I’m traveling all over theworld.”

—Audrey Hepburn

WITH MEMORIES OF HER OWN near starvation during the war still haunting the re-cesses of her mind, Audrey now began inching her way toward an increasedcommitment on behalf of poverty-stricken children, a commitment that accel-erated after watching the 1985 Live Aid concert organized by rock star BobGeldof. Startled and impressed by a worldwide audience of three billiondonating $\$ 70$ million, Audrey exclaimed to Luca: “This is a fantastic idea.”She had in effect reached a tipping point: her name, she realized, could beused on behalf of the world’s children, an illustration of the power ofcelebrity at its most potent.

In the Audrey Hepburn worldview, children constituted “our sacredcharge.” Her self-confessed need to give affection could now bear fruit on thewidest possible stage: “I’ve always had enormous love of people—of chil-dren. I would pick babies up out of prams when I was young. . . . I had a des-perate need to receive and give love. In fact, I think it is more important togive love than to receive it.”

The adoring mother of two sons would now, through her efforts, seem asif she had “adopted the world’s children.” If years earlier, Billy Wilder hadbluntly asked, “The difficulty with stars—what do they do if they are 50–55?,” Audrey was now providing a thoroughly unexpected answer: embarkupon the most meaningful work of one’s life. Here, in Audrey’s words, wasthe apotheosis of her own mother’s training—“that wonderful, old-fashioned

idea that others come first, and you come second. This was the whole ethicby which I was brought up. Others matter more than you do, so ‘don’t fussdear; get on with it.’”

Explaining how his mother’s commitment to UNICEF developed, Seancommented: “This decision grew first out of her own childhood under Ger-man occupation, with further seeds planted during her work on Nun’s Story.The actual offer came about because my mother had a cousin Leopold(Quarles van Ufford) who was the consul for Holland in Macao. Every yearthey would hold an event to benefit UNICEF, and he’d ask her to attend. Fi-nally she said yes, and agreed that she would serve as the host of their firstInternational Music Festival. This was October 1987—and the trip also in-cluded Hong Kong. She made a brief two-minute speech in Macao that wasvery well received.

“Jim Grant, whom I think of as the JFK of UNICEF—he took a postwarorganization and brought it into the modern age while doubling the numberof employees—had been in the audience in Macao. He said to my mother af-terwards: ‘You spoke so beautifully. Would you be interested in doing thisagain? You could make your own schedule.’ That’s how the actual offercame—she could now give back.”

She traveled to Tokyo for a benefit concert given by the World Philhar-monic Orchestra, her enduring appeal in Japan helping to ensure a highly suc-cessful turnout; audiences, she realized, might attend to see one of their fa-vorite movie stars in person, but they would stay to learn about UNICEF’sability to transform the world, one child at a time.

Fluent in English, Dutch, French, Italian, and German, she was slowly butsurely evolving into a citizen of the world, and her outlook on life changedaccordingly; if an influential columnist wanted to discuss her classic films ina trip down memory lane, she’d comply—as long as it also meant publicityfor UNICEF. “UNICEF means survival, development, and protection of chil-dren everywhere.” She designed the first day of issue envelope for a set ofUN stamps and would even sign photos of herself if the proceeds would flowto UNICEF: “It’s now clear to me the reason I got famous all those years ago.It was to have this career, this new one.” Said Sean: “My mother truly be-lieved that the greatest crime was to rob a child of his or her childhood.”

On Thursday, March 10, 1988, this devotion to giving back led her to fol-low in the steps of UNICEF activists Danny Kaye and Peter Ustinov and

formally accept a job as special ambassador for UNICEF: “It’s something I’ddo for my child, so why not for others?”

Pronouncing herself thrilled with her new position, in a letter written toUNICEF chief of special events Horst Cerni, she enthused: “I am tickled pinkby my little red U.N. passport!!!! UNICEF is keeping me going—andyoung.” Her salary? One dollar per year. All expenses, except for travel andaccommodations, were to be Audrey’s. It was, she said, the greatest role ofher career, the one she had “rehearsed for . . . all my life.”

She was starting to harness the power which lay in both her worldwidefame and the enormous goodwill she had built up over thirty years. With anactor’s instinct for the emotionally potent phrase, her trips began to generateworldwide press, a necessity for UNICEF, which did not receive any fundsfrom the United Nations budget.

She undertook her first major trip in March of 1988, flying out of Genevafor a five-day tour of Ethiopia with only one carry-on and two suitcases—sufficient, she felt, for both field visits and press conferences. Audrey Hep-burn, she of the jet set and ne plus ultra glamorous image, would be travelingby means of the most basic transportation: a Pilatus Porter PC-6 single-en-gine, single-wing, turboprop aircraft. In short, a utilitarian plane suited for theunpaved runways she and her fellow UNICEF workers would encounter ontheir flights throughout Ethiopia.

Accommodations were far from luxurious, but that proved to be of littleconcern. Recalling the hotel rooms in Ansara, Ethiopia, John Williams, exec-utive secretary of the UNICEF board, noted: “She never complained [when]the hotel had no water.” Nor did she balk at staying in a hotel that includedarmed guards in the lobby. Why, she was asked in interviews, would she puther life in danger by traveling to war zones. Her quick reply: “You just de-cide. Once you’ve decided, yes, I’ll deal with it, then you don’t think about itanymore.” Audrey Hepburn was on a single-minded mission.

Her fame mattered to her only if it could help the children: “In the citieswhere there are some movie houses and people who have traveled abroad,they might be aware of who I am, but not where we went. I just hope thatpeople at home will understand that once again there is a drought in Africa, inEthiopia in particular, one which is potentially much worse than last time.UNICEF is already helping, is helping them to help themselves. WhatUNICEF wants to do is give them a spade to dig their wells, and not dig the

graves of their children.”

Politics did not interest her, and she refused to take sides in the gravepolitical situation then ravaging Ethiopia, focusing instead upon how politi-cians could help the children in need. After the Marxist government launchedinto a critique of her efforts, she simply responded: “A child is a child is achild, whether his parents are Marxists or Nazis.” The politics found in eachcountry frustrated her: “Politics are something which are very hard for me tounderstand—the machinations are so complicated. . . . And responding to hu-man suffering, that’s finally what politics should be, ideally. That’s what Idream about.” Horrified by the fact that over forty thousand children a daydied from preventable diseases and hunger, Audrey maintained one overarch-ing goal: let the widest possible audience know about the unfolding disasterfacing the world’s children. “To save a child is a blessing: to save a million isa God-given opportunity.”

It wasn’t just politics she avoided but also organized religion; whenoffered the chance for an audience with Pope John Paul II, she turned it downbecause of her disagreement with the church’s stance on birth control. SaidLuca in later years: “She had never been a big fan of the Catholic Church—you know, give money so you can go to heaven.” Instead, Audrey seemed tohold a deep belief in animism, telling Luca: “Nature is above the humans. Weare not ruling the planet; we have to be with the planet.”

The poverty she encountered in Ethiopia proved overwhelming, and theimages of starving children seared themselves into her consciousness. Whenvisiting a refugee camp, she glimpsed a young girl standing off by herself,and after slowly approaching the girl, asked what she wanted to be when shegrew older: the answer came back: “Alive.” The cumulative effect weighedon her: “The neglect and humiliation of a child by adults is a killer of trust, ofhope, and of possibility.” It was on this same trip, at an orphanage inMekelee, that she met Father Chasade, a Catholic priest who spoke to Audreywith words that she came to repeat with increasing frequency over the years:“If you can’t send me food for my children, then send me the spades to digtheir graves.”

Trip completed, Audrey undertook a grueling schedule of interviews totell the world about the crisis in Ethiopia. After flying from Addis Ababa toNew York City, she taped Good Morning America, spoke to two dozen re-porters at UNICEF’s New York headquarters, followed up the next day with

appearances on The Today Show, CBS This Morning, CNN Live, and Enter-tainment Tonight, and topped off those efforts by taping four television ap-peals for the U.S. UNICEF Committee. As her commitment to UNICEFdeepened, she could be counted on to rattle off statistics with precision andunending passion: there were, she forcefully stated, 5.6 billion people onearth, of whom 3 billion lived on less than 2 dollars per day, and 1.3 billionon under 1 dollar a day; 1.5 billion lived without clean water. In frustrationshe exclaimed: “Will it always be acceptable for their children to die of star-vation and for our children to be fat?”

Traveling to Washington, DC, she met with U.S. senators and agreed tointerviews with National Public Radio, the Washington Post, the WashingtonTimes, and USA Today. Her energy seemed limitless when it came toUNICEF, and traveling to Canada the very next day, she agreed to interviewswith two Toronto newspapers as well as the CBC, CBC radio, and CTV. Herglobetrotting concluded with a trip to London, where in her numerous inter-views she made her priorities clear: “I am not interested in promoting AudreyHepburn these days. I am interested in telling the world about how they canhelp in Ethiopia and why I came away feeling optimistic.”

Audrey Hepburn, movie star, fashion icon, and idol of millions, had foundher purpose in life among the poorest and most neglected children on earth.

As an enormously effective public face for UNICEF, she helped raiseheretofore unthinkable sums. Said the UNICEF photographer John Isaac:“Jim Grant told me they got $\$ 1$ million in contributions every time she madean appeal on Barbara Walters or wherever. She made such a huge impres-sion.” Added Audrey’s friend John Isaac, “that’s what made her happy.” Ad-ded Isaac pointedly: “Audrey had no color, no race.” Said Sean: “She joinedUNICEF and in 5 years UNICEF had doubled in size. I don’t think that hadhappened since the war.”

At the conclusion of her trip to Ethiopia, the United Nations reported that“during the Ethiopian crisis, a drive to raise $\$ 22$ million for medicine, vac-cines, and other non-food supplies was centered on her activities.” In thewords of former UNICEF USA CEO Caryl Stern: “There was a big rise indonations whenever she spoke. The American public—the whole world—was swayed by her voice, even after she died. In fact, after she died, when wehad a huge gala in Dallas that was a tribute to Audrey and her legacy, itproved to be one of our most successful fundraisers ever. For quite some time

we had an Audrey Hepburn Society, which was made up of those who gavegifts above a certain level. People would actually raise the amount of theirdonations just to become members of the Audrey Hepburn Society and havetheir own names affiliated with Audrey’s.”

Arriving home in Switzerland after her trip to Ethiopia, she spoke to agroup of forty journalists from several different countries and gave one-on-one interviews to Swiss TV and France’s Antenne2. She was exhausted, a bitdepressed, full of stories, and in the words of close friend Doris Brynner,“completely done in.” After only one trip, she already understood that shehad arrived at a major turning point in her life: “I was so eager to go. I’vebeen so privileged to be given this opportunity to do something for children.It’s a marvelous happening for me that they are allowing me to do this. I’mhappy to travel. For the children I’d go to the moon! It was a great relief forme because I’ve sat in front of the television and been frustrated. I had a pentup feeling of not doing anything, and now I can—it’s a great relief.”

Audrey had made the world pay attention to Ethiopia for the first timesince Bob Geldof’s Live Aid concert, and as a result, UNICEF promoted herfrom special ambassador to goodwill ambassador. Her star power, particu-larly at the black-tie galas designed to raise large sums of money, worked inways that it never had for another celebrity, because part of what audiencesresponded to in her onscreen performances resulted from their knowledge ofwho she was as a person: sensitive, vulnerable, and genuinely caring. Theaudience collectively sensed that she understood issues of war, poverty, andhealth care because of her own childhood experiences, and they responded inkind with substantial donations.

Audrey Hepburn, people intuited, was the furthest thing from a celebritydispensing help out of a distanced sense of noblesse oblige. In her ownwords: “The ‘third world’ is a term I don’t like very much because we’re allone world. I want people to know that the largest part of humanity is suffer-ing.”

Said Caryl Stern: “Audrey was, along with Danny Kaye, one of the ori-ginal ambassadors, and everyone knew it was real—she had great credibilityand set a standard for all future ambassadors. At UNICEF, we in effect wantto date before marrying—we want to know the celebrity means it and is de-voted. I would take them to the field, on an actual trip, before the affiliationbecame official; they had to speak ‘kid’—they had to be real. Because you

have to get on your hands and knees, not worry about makeup, and you haveto deal with the heat of Africa. There are bugs, snakes, smells, flies—youmust want to be there because when you’re in the field, the field has no ideawho the celebrity is, and there are no creature comforts. No one is carryingyour bag, there is no five-star hotel, and you’re not traveling on a privateplane. I can tell on the first day whether or not they will make it, andAudrey’s dedication was one thousand percent. We never want to diminishthe honesty and integrity that Audrey brought to the organization. All thosethat followed had to rise to the level of commitment she set.”

Although Audrey never could fully comprehend the nature of her appeal,in a lengthy 1990 television interview about her career, she came the closestshe ever would to understanding how her persona appealed and helped toraise funds for UNICEF: “I have an enormous love for humanity and for thehuman qualities in people when they come out—that perhaps is what hascome through off the screen to the public.”

There was one additional key reason for Audrey’s effectiveness as aUNICEF ambassador: she did her homework for each trip, studying the polit-ical, economic and agricultural situation in each country she would visit: “It’snot even enough to know there has been a flood in Bangladesh and seventhousand people lost their lives. Why the flood? What is their history? Whyare they one of the poorest countries of today?”

As she gained in experience, she hit upon a formula to further increase hereffectiveness: she would travel to Guatemala or Bangladesh and then followup with a trip to the United States, Canada, or Europe in order to speak out,raise funds, and stress the urgency of her mission. She still did not like speak-ing in public, and close associates from both UNICEF and Hollywood notedthat her knees would literally knock before delivering a speech. Yet when itcame time for her to speak about UNICEF, she would walk purposefully tocenter stage and quietly, with great command, deliver her message. Said Rob-bie Wolders: “Even though I knew the text of every speech she gave forUNICEF I was sometimes moved to tears when I heard her deliver it. She ex-uded such purity, innocence, and vulnerability, and at the same time, utterconviction. It made me tremendously proud.”

Each of her trips placed her in extraordinarily difficult situations, yet herdrive seemed unstoppable. The March 1988 trip to Ethiopia had been fol-lowed in October of that same year by trips to Ecuador and Venezuela. The

whirlwind trip to Venezuela included stops at Barinas, Caracas, and Quitoand culminated in a visit with the country’s new president, Rodrigo BorjaCevallos. It proved an especially difficult trip for two reasons: (1) For thefirst time, Audrey found that there were limits to press interest in herUNICEF trips. In the view of the media, poverty in Venezuela simply did notmerit the same attention as the unfolding famine in Ethiopia. (2) Audreycame face-to-face with the overwhelming issue of street children who hadeither been abandoned by parents or were forced to earn money for their fam-ilies. Runaways preferred a life on the streets to homes plagued with viol-ence, and, she learned, a horrifying sex industry for children as young as nineyears old proved widespread. Said Robbie: “Eventually what affected hereven more than those children who were suffering of hunger or disease werethe thousands upon thousands of children that we saw who had lost their par-ents, who had nothing to relate to, who had no affection. That was somethingshe could relate to even more.”

As a follow-up to these trips, UNICEF scheduled Audrey for travel to Tur-key. Though she had been well prepared for the trip to Ethiopia, she was de-termined to be even more thoroughly informed about Turkey, and to that end,UNICEF’s Christa Roth came to Tolochenaz with briefing papers. It was, inessence, a combination tutorial, boot camp, and university exam, but AudreyHepburn wanted facts and figures. Thoroughly prepared, she traveled to Tur-key in April of 1989 to promote the benefits of immunization in combatingthe six main childhood diseases of measles, tuberculosis, tetanus, whoopingcough, diphtheria, and polio. Striving to mix positive news in with the dis-heartening reports about widespread childhood illness, she noted that of theforty thousand children who die worldwide every day, thousands of thoselives could be saved simply through immunization. Speaking proudly of hertrip to Turkey she explained: “It took us ten days to vaccinate the wholecountry—not bad.”

Audrey may not have liked politics, but savvy she was, and with an eye onfuture governmental help, she went out of her way to praise the Turkish gov-ernment as well as the country’s radio and television stations for the successof the inoculation campaign. (In an amusing sidenote to the trip, Turkish tele-vision was showing My Fair Lady in Audrey’s honor, and since RobertWolders had never seen the film, Audrey agreed that they would watch it;their viewing did not last long, given that the entire film—with the notable

exception of Marni Nixon’s singing —was dubbed in Turkish.)

Although her own suffering during World War II was an oft-told and well-known story, she refused to equate her own deprivations with those she ob-served firsthand in Africa, and she consistently downplayed her own child-hood trauma: “My suffering is not comparable; yes, we had German occupa-tion, long winters, malnutrition, in fact high degree of malnutrition, but mylife was never in danger. It is if the war had gone on that my health mighthave been impaired.” Her wartime experiences may have influenced her ded-ication to UNICEF, but, she emphasized, it constituted “more than paying adebt. I would have done the work even if I had not known war.”

UNICEF had become the total focus of her working life, playing out if shehad taken to heart the words of playwright Edward Albee while discussinghis surprising admiration for Thornton Wilder’s Our Town as the greatestplay ever written by an American author: “When it is done properly it makesus understand that if we don’t live our lives fully and completely, we’vewasted everything we have.” Audrey not only wanted to live her own lifefully, but she was also insistent that the world’s children be afforded the op-portunity to do the same, that those in power not waste the abundance theyhad been given.

February 1989 found her making a trip to Guatemala, Honduras, El Sal-vador, and Mexico. The trip to Mexico included stops in remote villageswhere she could publicize both new water systems and oral rehydration ther-apies, but it was El Salvador that proved particularly daunting, with the tripcoming at an unfortunately violent time in the country’s history. Estimates ofthe number of men, women, and children—including priests and nuns—whohad been murdered over the past decade ran as high as seventy thousand. Andyet Audrey did not hesitate: the trip was necessary, end of discussion. SaidHorst Cerni: “Audrey was never concerned about her personal safety. She feltbeing on a mission for UNICEF and the suffering children in a particularcountry provided an unseen shield from dangers. All her missions were dan-gerous.”

It was all a long way from a pampered Hollywood set but fulfilled a needin Audrey that Hollywood never could, and in order to publicize her work forUNICEF, she finally agreed to an interview with Barbara Walters, one of sev-eral journalists who had relentlessly pursued her for years. In an interviewwhich reached over ten million United States households, she talked a bit

about Hollywood, but what she really wanted was to publicize UNICEF: “Ican personally do very little, but I can contribute to a whole chain of events—which would be UNICEF. And that’s a marvelous thing. It’s like a bonus tome towards the end of my life.”

In 1989 she flew with Robbie to Sudan, the biggest country in Africa andone racked by civil war, armed bandits, a measles epidemic, and starvation. Ameeting with Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi preceded a trip to the WhiteNile for the start of Operation Lifeline Sudan, but nothing had quite preparedAudrey for her next stop, the refugee camp El Meiram.

El Meiram, crammed with thousands of starving men, women, and chil-dren who were wracked by dysentery, represented a terrible new iteration ofthe famine that had plagued Ethiopia, and when Audrey spoke to the press,she did not hide her anger: “They have nothing left—not even their bodies.They are so emaciated. It seems that all they have left are their souls.” Evenher travel conditions, minimalistic at the best of times, grew worse in Sudan;flying on a Cessna at night with some journalists, Audrey was handed a flakjacket—not to wear, but to sit on, should bullets or rockets strike the planedirectly through the fuselage.

After her trip to war-torn Sudan, she testified in April 1989 before the U.S.House Foreign Operations Sub-Committee and House Select Sub-Committeeon World Hunger. She grew blunt: “There is no deficit in human resources.There is only a deficit of human will.” Nervous but determined, she spokefrom handwritten notes detailing the building of dams in Ethiopia and watersystems in Ecuador, literacy efforts in Guatemala and immunization in ElSalvador—all of the efforts funded by UNICEF: “So, Mr. Chairman, I amhere today to speak for children who cannot speak for themselves, childrenwho are going blind from lack of vitamins, children who are being slowlymutilated by polio, children who are wasting away through lack of water, forthe estimated 100 million street children in the world . . .” In Sean’s recollec-tion: “When she testified before the U.S. Congress regarding a humanitariancrisis, she got $\$ 60$ million in one hour from them. That showed how ex-traordinarily powerful she still was.”

Two months later, on June 13, she delivered a powerful address to mem-bers of the United Nations staff in Geneva and once again pulled no punches:“When the impact becomes visible in the rising death rates among children,then what has happened is simply an outrage against a large section of hu-

manity. Nothing can justify it.” Yes, the vagaries of nature could and did ex-acerbate problems, but Audrey placed the majority of the blame squarely onthe shoulders of her fellow man: “Whether it be famine in Ethiopia, excruci-ating poverty in Guatemala and Honduras, civil strife in El Salvador, or anethnic massacre in the Sudan, I saw but one glaring truth: these are not nat-ural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-madesolution: peace.”

In her own words, Audrey was always willing to keep “talking my headoff” in search of money because, in her memorable phrase, “The worst viol-ence in Africa is widespread poverty.” In search of maximum impact, hermessage of urgency was stripped down to the most basic of analogies: “[If] achild has been hit by a car, at that moment you don’t stop and wonder whosefault it is—was the driver going too fast, or did the child run after his ball?You just pick him up and run all the way to the hospital.”

For field trips into poverty-stricken countries, Audrey wore a uniform ofkhaki slacks, Lacoste shirts, scarves and sunglasses, minimalism at work inservice of the greater good. Dressed in basic black for media appearances, shewore the same outfit multiple times, pressed her own clothes, and did herown hair and makeup. One look at her television appearances to publicize herwork for UNICEF tells even a casual viewer all they need to know aboutchanged priorities: Givenchy’s favorite model, the paragon of Parisian chic,was now dressed down in casual, comfortable clothes, with no sense of fussin sight. She was uninterested in turning an interview into any sort ofcelebrity retrospective and spoke about her movies only as a quid pro quo forholding a conversation about the needs of children around the world. “Are wenot reaping the mess we made so many years ago when we enrichedourselves? We didn’t do a hell of a lot for those people, did we? That’s whyit’s right that we do now.”

After a lifetime of being pampered for life in front of the camera, she hadceased dwelling on her appearance. Age spots on her hands? Fine—let themshow. Long gone were the days of traveling with fifty bags and trunks, all ofthem packed with her china, linens, and designer clothes. All personal trap-pings were subordinated in service of the message, a lesson unfortunately notlearned by the well-meaning Sophia Loren in her work for the United Na-tions. Loren, who had herself suffered tremendous deprivation in Italy duringthe Second World War, seemed strangely oblivious to the optics of her UN

work, and arrived for her appointment ceremony as a UN goodwill ambas-sador in a Rolls-Royce that matched the color of her fur coat.

Audrey remained modest about her own contribution, thinking of herselfas a concerned citizen, nothing more. In fact, she was far more than a con-cerned citizen, and her reach and impact amongst Hollywood activists hasbeen, through the years, rivaled only by Angelina Jolie’s. Unlike Audrey,Jolie had not basically retired when she began her work for the UN, but shealso possessed Audrey’s skill at utilizing the press for the purposes of hercharitable work. Jolie shared Audrey’s rock-ribbed dedication to the safetyand education of children, and with the honorary damehood personally be-stowed upon her by Queen Elizabeth in 2014, she had completed a strikinglysuccessful metamorphosis from a much-married woman who wore a vial ofher ex-husband’s blood around her neck to St. Angelina in khakis.

There was one caveat in all of Audrey’s appeals, however. UNICEF couldand would provide the necessary tools, but the key work for any projectwould be done by the citizens of the country in question: it was their land,their labor, and their pride of place. She had sounded this theme of self-suffi-ciency as far back as that first trip in Ethiopia: “I am very impressed by thepeople of Ethiopia, by their beauty, by their patience and by the enormous de-sire, their enormous will to help themselves.” Of her Latin American trip in1989, she noted with pride: “I watched boys build their own schoolhousewith bricks and cement provided by UNICEF.”

In visiting as many countries as possible, touching and picking up endlessbabies no matter how gravely ill, in spreading the word before indifferent andoften hostile governments, she had at last found the enormous family she hadalways wanted. Said John Isaac, who accompanied her on many of herUNICEF missions: “Often the kids would have flies all over them, but shewould just go hug them . . . other people had a certain amount of hesitation,but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand,touch her—she was like the pied piper.” More than ever she fully led with herheart; on her trips, explained Isaac: “Dignity and love were what we alwaystalked about. With the sufferings she went through, she always said, ‘I loveyou’ and would never hold back with the children.”

Audrey was now routinely referred to as a saint for her efforts, a compli-ment she did not particularly enjoy; if she was thought of as a saint, then thatmade her code of conduct virtually unattainable for others, and she wanted

everyone to know that they too could contribute to saving children. If she wasa saint, then she was a saint who was riddled with self-doubt, one who couldeven occasionally grow short-tempered when faced with bureaucratic in-transigence. Always considering herself a work in progress, she consistentlybrushed aside any praise for her work: “After all, I am doing only what anyother human being would do.” Most human beings did not, of course, travelthe globe to work in war-torn countries, and as the months went by, she, likemembers of Doctors Without Borders and Partners in Health, succeeded inbecoming part of a rare humanitarian band who neglected any personal com-fort in order to help those lacking even the most elemental resources.

Following her trip to Latin America, October of 1989 found her flying toAustralia to personally plea for continued UNICEF funding. Thanks to herpresence at a dinner in Parliament House, $\$ 2$ million was raised in a singleday. Said Ian MacLeod of the Australian Committee for UNICEF: “It waslike having your favorite aunt arrive. No airs, no pretenses; just an incredibleamount of grace, sincerity, and love.”

The trip to Australia and Asia included time in Bangkok for a meetingwith human rights activist Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, and most notably, astop in flood devastated Bangladesh. Henry Kissinger had famously termedBangladesh a “basket case,” and Audrey was determined to send a differentmessage. Explained John Isaac: “With Bangladesh—people had given up andshe said ‘That’s where I want to go. Those are the people I’d like to go andsupport.’” Visiting orphanages, a Dhaka slum, and the remote northernBengali countryside, Audrey drove herself relentlessly. Close friend AnnaCataldi instantly understood her friend’s motivation: “She realized the vast-ness of the tragedy. In a sense you’re marked by that. She wanted to go backand back and back. In a way it’s an addiction.”

She still popped up with the occasional show business appearance, but itwas always with UNICEF in mind. In September she served alongside HarryBelafonte as host of the first International Danny Kaye Awards in the Nether-lands, and two months later, agreed to be the guest of honor at the DutchFilmhuis Den Haag for a screening of Funny Face. Still underplaying herown extraordinary screen legacy, and calling herself “an actor by chance,nothing more, nothing less,” it was her presence, along with a Sotheby auc-tion of three dresses, including one designed by Givenchy, that raised$\$ 50,000$ for UNICEF.

By now she was feeling the strain of her exhausting schedule and in 1990reached out to Roger Moore, whom she had known since both had small partsin 1951’s One Wild Oat, to see if he would possibly take over as UNICEFgoodwill ambassador. Five years removed from his last outing as James Bondin A View to a Kill, Moore agreed, beginning his partnership with Audrey inAugust of 1990 when they co-hosted the Second Annual Danny KayeAwards. Said Moore: “When one of the world’s great beauties calls you andasks if you would like to go somewhere with her, what do you say? No? Ofcourse not! You ask where and when?”

Not yet well-informed about UNICEF, Moore tried to beg off the obligat-ory press conference, but a no-nonsense Audrey simply replied: “Roger. ThePress will not want to talk about UNICEF; they will want to talk aboutmovies!” Audrey was correct, but in Moore’s admiring recount: “Shewouldn’t let them. Every question that was asked, Audrey turned around tothe problems facing the world’s children.” Moore’s admiration for Audreysoon grew to the point that he took to ending all of his own solo theatre ap-pearances by reciting Audrey’s favorite poem “The Beauty of a Woman,” fol-lowed by an announcement that UNICEF collection buckets would be avail-able in the theatre lobby.

Hope remained the currency in which she traded, and while her graciousmanner may have remained intact, when speaking truth to power she refusedto sugarcoat: “Donor fatigue and compassion fatigue just cannot apply to themonumental suffering in the developing world today—the only true fatigue isthat of a mother seeing yet another one of her babies die.”

Mustering the energy for a few final trips, on October 26, 1990, accom-panied by Time magazine photographer Peter Charlesworth and two televi-sion cameramen, she hopped into an old Sikorsky helicopter and landed inVietnam’s northern province near the Chinese border. After touring a villagewater system—she was shown priming a pump, splashing her face with cleanwater, and pointedly noting that “the wells have all been made by the Viet-namese themselves”—she visited a school and spent time at a health center,more than happy to wear the skirt and blouse of the Tay people; no clothingcould have been further from the rarified world of Givenchy, which is pre-cisely why Audrey knew that photographs of her wearing a native outfitwould generate widespread publicity. Emphasizing UNICEF’s role in tryingto provide sorely needed schoolbooks and medicines, she returned to one of

the themes that underlay all of her work—UNICEF would help provide tools,but all of the hard work could and would be accomplished through self-de-termination: “What’s extraordinary about Vietnam and its people is that un-like some of our countries, there may be a deficit of resources but not ofwill.”

Always hungering to do more, she now admitted: “I’d like to be in thefield and maybe vaccinate and operate like young doctors, but I can’t.” Oper-ate she could not, but her contribution remained enormous and life altering:the widespread media coverage of her travels meant that during the years sheworked for UNICEF, gifts to the U.S. Committee for UNICEF doubled.

The overwhelming irony underlying this unceasing work on behalf ofUNICEF lay in the fact that stardom, the most narcissistic of occupations,now allowed her to perform the most selfless of acts. In the perfectly attunedwords of one commentator: “The child became the adult who reached back tohelp the child.”

Even as she grew increasingly exhausted, her endless drive derived from adetermination to penetrate the world’s indifference: “250,000 children dieevery week. It’s the greatest tragedy of our time. It must stop.” Asked by tele-vision talk show host Larry King why she didn’t work, she instantly replied:“This is my work, Larry!” And while she always expressed gratitude for hertime in Hollywood, it remained impossible to find her speaking about a filmin the same excited tones she utilized when telling interviewers: “Last yearwe provided 52 million schoolbooks for Bangladesh, and in the last eightyears we have sunk 250,000 tube wells.”

Stanley Donen, so often ready with an acerbic comment, gave Audrey arather backhanded compliment about her UNICEF work by exclaiming:“Never in a million years would I have predicted that Audrey would give somuch, so selflessly and at such personal cost to a cause like UNICEF.” Itwas, however, the equally opinionated Rex Harrison who surprisingly tookthe opposite viewpoint, explaining: “No, it’s just the sort of thing she woulddo. . . . She understands the urgency of hunger and deprivation in a personalimmediate way.”

How did she keep going? How did she manage the sheer logistics of flyingaround the world into countries that often had no infrastructure? As Audreywas the first to admit, her constant travels on behalf of UNICEF were onlypossible with the help and support of Robert Wolders, who was soon appoin-

ted by UNICEF as her manager. By now Audrey and Wolders were life com-panions, and the pleasant irony underlying their devotion to UNICEF lay inthe fact that when they first met, the last thing that would have been on eitherof their minds was globetrotting work for UNICEF. Instead, their initialmeeting proved to be a pleasant conversation between two Dutch survivors ofWorld War II, each a disillusioned yet still hopeful romantic.

In meeting Robert Wolders, Audrey Hepburn, who craved control as muchas she did love, who had organized and compartmentalized for decades onend, had for the first time in her life finally moved from one beat to the nextwithout hesitation. After a lifetime of worry and care, she was, once and forall, about to exhale.

“We were ready for each other. . . . At the time in our lives that we met, wehad both made our mistakes.”

—Robert Wolders

WHEN AUDREY MET ROBERT. A genteel Dutch-centric meeting of two sensitive,extraordinarily good-looking people that ended up providing Audrey with thelove of a lifetime when she least expected it.

If Gigi and Roman Holiday had found Audrey Hepburn the right girl in theright place at the right time, then when he met Audrey, Robert Wolders washimself the right man at the right place at the right time. Nine years Audrey’sjunior, Wolders had lived happily with his twenty-five-years-older wife, thebeautiful movie star Merle Oberon, until her death in 1979 at age sixty-eight.It had been a loving and fulfilling relationship, and when Oberon lay dying,she had said to Wolders: “You owe it to me to be happy, to restart your life.”

In the many myths surrounding Audrey’s life, Oberon’s statement hasbeen reshaped as “You owe it to me to be happy and remarry,” as if Oberonhad presciently ordained that Wolders would meet and marry Audrey. No,Oberon had not foreseen Audrey and Wolders falling in love, but she andAudrey had met several times and liked each other, and in a startling piece ofHollywood synchronicity, Audrey’s role of Karen Wright in The Children’sHour had been played by Merle in These Three, the original film made fromLillian Hellman’s play.

Audrey and Wolders’s first meeting came in February 1980 over dinner atthe home of Audrey’s friend Connie Wald. Connie’s home constituted homebase for Audrey whenever she traveled to Los Angeles, and their friendshipendured until Audrey’s death. Said Wald: “She was such a fabulous lady.

There was never anyone like her. I simply loved her. We had common tastes.We both loved our houses, our families. We both liked to cook. . . . All shereally wanted was to have dinner in the kitchen, not even in the dining room.”So comfortable did Audrey feel at Connie’s home that, in Connie’s recall, atone point while planning to build a home in Los Angeles, Audrey had an ar-chitect come to the Wald home “so he could design a smaller version of ourhouse for her in L.A.”

The comfortable setting of Wald’s home had resulted in a conversationbetween Audrey and Robert Wolders that lasted throughout the entire dinner,leading to the discovery that they had lived within thirty miles of each otherin Holland during the war. Said Wolders of that meeting: “The first night Imet her I was struck by her wistfulness and her fragility.” Audrey’s memorywas similarly guarded: “I was charmed with him that night but he didn’t re-gister that much. We were both very unhappy.”

Six months later, Connie Wald stepped in as matchmaker, urging Woldersto call Audrey when he had to fly to New York, where Audrey was filmingThey All Laughed. Audrey and Wolders met for dinner at the Pierre Hotel,which led to long phone calls after Wolders returned to Los Angeles.Wolders humorously recalled that he “found out later that she had me in mindfor her ex-sister-in-law.” But their talks grew ever longer until “one day shecalled, and afterward I said, ‘That’s it, I have to go to New York.’”

With Audrey still officially married to Andrea Dotti, the relationship re-mained private. Wolders visited Tolochenaz, but it was only in 1981, afterAudrey formally separated from Dotti, that they both decided Wolders shouldmove into La Paisible. Explained Wolders: “When her divorce became final,we were together all the time. It seemed so natural.” Looking back in lateryears he analyzed: “We had the good fortune to find each other, and I hadgone through some bad stuff as well. We had no friction or hardships, really,except for some of the petty things which were easily settled.” Their relation-ship was, he said, “a wonderful friendship. . . . We’re both patient.”

It was their mutual devotion to UNICEF that further helped to anchor theirrelationship, because Wolders, who years earlier had arranged a charity auc-tion of the valuable jewelry left to him by Merle Oberon, spent nearly asmuch time on the charity as did Audrey. Explained Audrey: “Robert is just aspassionate about children and UNICEF as I am.” Wolders himself later ana-lyzed their team effort: “For five years we did at least seven months of work

for UNICEF—field trips and fund raising events all over the world.”

It was Robert who took care of all travel arrangements, hotel reservations,booking of planes, and ground transportation, often in countries which pos-sessed only the most rudimentary infrastructure. To that end, it remained apoint of honor for both Audrey and Wolders to never fly first class; at best,they might buy each other business class tickets as a special treat, but, poin-ted out Sean: “Throughout our youth she had traveled economy all overEurope. She felt that in a day and age when so many people were goinghungry, it was inappropriate to fly first class.”

Sean and Wolders bonded easily, but Luca, ten years younger than hisbrother and used to having his father as the leading man in his mother’s life,took longer to warm up to the actor. Wolders did, however, win over thetoughest critic of all, Audrey’s mother Ella. Said Audrey: “She opposed bothmy marriages, maybe knowing neither man was going to be totally good tome. But I must say, she adored Robbie.”

Wolders’s gentle manner and Dutch background softened Ella’s formid-ably austere exterior, yet he too found it striking that even at this late junc-ture, Ella could not bring herself to freely express her love for Audrey, deepthough it was. In the symbiotic relationship between mother and daughter,Ella now relied upon Audrey financially, but Audrey, still seeking hermother’s approval, depended upon Ella from an emotional standpoint. Therelationship remained complicated until the very end, not only because ofElla’s emotional reticence and aristocratic manner but also because ofAudrey’s lingering resentment about her mother’s flirtation with the Nazis.Said Luca: “Now I’ve come to understand that the underlying reason for allthat was rooted in the political past of my grandmother. My mother had avery clear black-and-white, good-and-bad notion about the whole Nazi era.”

It was Robbie who helped bridge the gap between mother and daughter:“[Ella] would use me as a conduit because she knew I would convey all thatshe felt to Audrey.” At the same time, the relationship between Audrey andRobbie’s mother Cemelia remained happily and noticeably uncomplicated,and Audrey took to calling Cemelia “Maman.”

Life with Robbie provided Audrey with the romantic match she had beenseeking throughout her life, but any thoughts of “if only I had met himsooner” were quickly pushed aside by her practical nature. With a perspectivehoned by five decades of living, she rationalized: “If I’d met him when I was

18, I wouldn’t have appreciated him. I would have thought ‘That’s the wayeveryone is.’”

For the first time in Audrey’s life there was now a day-in-and-day-outsteadiness in her romantic relationship, one informed by a quality of trust andcaring. In Audrey’s view: “If a man has the indefinable quality that I can onlycall ‘warmth’ or ‘charm’ then I’ll feel at ease with him.” She found Wolders“very loving, he’s a very affectionate man. I can trust him, I trust his love. Inever fear that I’m losing it.” Mel Ferrer had loved the Hollywood action, thehum and buzz of deal making, and Andrea Dotti thrived upon the glamorouscircus that constituted life in Rome, but Wolders, like Audrey, felt most com-fortable in the quiet rural life found at La Paisible.

So strong was their mutual attachment to home that Audrey planned eachUNICEF trip to make sure that they were never away from their four JackRussell terriers for more than two weeks; she had, in fact, given Robbie oneof the terriers—“Tuppy”—for his fiftieth birthday because he had never hadhis own dog. Explained Audrey contentedly: “In the evenings we are veryhomey. We’re mostly vegetarian because we don’t need the protein at ourage. I don’t drink wine, but I like my little Scottish whisky before dinner. Wehave a television set in the bedroom and after dinner it’s curl-up time, eitherwatching a programme, a video or reading. I’m always asleep by 11 p.m.”

Marriage was not in the cards because neither Audrey nor Wolders feltany need. Declared Audrey: “We’re happy as we are,” and Wolders bluntlyanalyzed her previous marriages as a cautionary tale: “Everyone knows howunhappy her marriage to Mel was, and the second, to Andrea, was evenworse. It would be like asking someone who has just got out of an electricchair to sit back on it again.” Fashioning a life in which they took care of, andseemed to complete, each other, Audrey and Wolders kept separate bank ac-counts and enjoyed nothing more than staying home. Peter Bogdanovich didwrite that “there reportedly were troubles toward the end,” but Audreyseemed happy with Wolders, and in Sean’s view, “although their relationshipwas not without small tensions and disagreements, what they had sharedthrough the UNICEF years would probably have been enough to carry themthrough to the end of their lives.”

Said Jeffrey Banks: “The extraordinary thing about Audrey was that menalways wanted to protect her—to shield her from all the bad in the world.That was what I wanted to do starting at age eleven. But Rob’s the one who

truly did it.”

“And in a cameo as the heavenly sage who sends Dreyfuss back to earth,Audrey Hepburn is incandescent. Her dialogue is treacle, but she sells itwith an effortless grace that shows why she is still a legend at sixty.”

—Peter Travers in Rolling Stone

HAPPY IN HER LIFE WITH ROBBIE, and thoroughly devoted to her work on behalfof UNICEF, Audrey had made only one television movie—Love AmongThieves—in the six years since the 1981 release of They All Laughed. Whichis why, in 1989, movie lovers were very pleasantly startled at the news thatAudrey Hepburn was returning to films. And not just in any jerry-riggedvehicle, but rather in a remake of the beloved 1943 classic A Guy Named Joe.Who would be overseeing her return to the big screen? The king of Holly-wood himself, Steven Spielberg.

A superstar in his own right, Spielberg courted Audrey unceasingly, and inJune of 1989, with production of his film already underway, he plaintivelywrote her: “In any case, whether or not you would decide to join our familyin the last weeks of production, it is a tremendous thrill for me to make thisoffer.” (Once a fan, always a fan—after working with Audrey, Spielberg pur-chased the rights to a script written by the then unknown Ryan Murphy, en-titled Why Can’t I Be Audrey Hepburn?; although never filmed, the storycentered around a news anchor who idolizes Audrey Hepburn, gets left at thealtar, and then starts a friendship with her ex-fiancé’s best friend.)

No one knew it at the time, of course, but Audrey Hepburn’s cameo role inthis Guy Named Joe remake, now titled Always, would come to represent herlast ever feature film appearance. In retrospect, concluding her movie careerwith Steven Spielberg made a certain kind of sense: she had started her fea-

ture film career under the guidance of golden age masters William Wyler andBilly Wilder, and she would now end it under the direction of their modern-day equivalent, Steven Spielberg.

Why did Audrey choose to appear as guardian angel “Hap” in Spielberg’sremake of Victor Fleming’s wartime fantasy? It turned out she had admiredSpielberg’s work ever since watching E.T., exclaiming to Luca at the end ofthat movie: “This man is not just a director. He’s the best storyteller I haveever experienced!” Yes, she still remained fully immersed in her work forUNICEF, but the chance to work with Spielberg also represented the fulfill-ment of a wish expressed in an interview two years earlier: “It would be funto do another part before I roll over. People are inclined to send scripts to mefor which the parts are too young. I’d love to do a picture with Michael Caineor Michael Douglas—actors who have style but aren’t pompous about it.”

She certainly wasn’t desperate for the money, although she would receivean extraordinary $850,000 for ten days of work, most of which she donated toUNICEF. Nonetheless, her practical side asserted itself because, in the wordsof Robert Wolders, “she had to replenish her coffers.” She never did letmoney rule her life, and when the financial crash hit in the mid-1980s, it wasRobbie who was genuinely afraid of financial disaster, while Audrey reactedwith great equanimity, exclaiming to him: “So what? Even if we were to loseeverything, we have a garden; we can grow potatoes and eat them.” In Luca’sastute analysis, such acceptance spoke in large part to the primary place gar-dens held in his mother’s heart and worldview: “Having a garden gave her re-assurance, that in any event, she could produce her own fruit and vegetables.She also found that taking care of beautiful gardens was a way to fight herown demons. After a war like that, you are always left with the fear that itcould happen again.”

Audrey, who had lived through the horrors of Nazi occupation, would nowbe teaming with Steven Spielberg, who throughout his extraordinary careerhad never met a World War II trope he didn’t like. The director had firstwatched A Guy Named Joe on television as a youngster in Phoenix, explain-ing it was “the second movie, after Bambi, that made me cry.” The movie’splot centered around World War II pilot Pete Sandidge (Spencer Tracy) whodies in combat but comes back to earth in order to telepathically let his griev-ing girlfriend Dorinda (Irene Dunne) know that she must move on with herlife. This, then, was a story that spoke to Spielberg’s perennial exploration of

loss: loss of innocence (E.T.), loss of childhood (Hook), and even, in his per-sonal life at the time, the divorce/loss of first wife Amy Irving.

Based upon Dalton Trumbo’s original 1943 screenplay, the script for Al-ways, credited to Jerry Belson and Diane Thomas with an assist by adaptorFrederick Hazlitt Brennan, represented Spielberg’s most concerted attemptyet at filming a boy-meets-girl romance, albeit one otherworldly in nature. InSpielberg’s version, the story would now center around firefighting pilot PeteSandich (played by Richard Dreyfuss, who stated he had seen A Guy NamedJoe over thirty times); after dying in a crash, Sandich returns as a guardianangel to young flyer Ted Baker (Brad Johnson), who has fallen in love withPete’s old girlfriend Dorinda (Holly Hunter).

The part of Hap, Pete’s guardian angel, had been played by Lionel Barry-more in the original, and this remake had been written with the idea of Hapagain being played by a man. When first choice Sean Connery proved un-available because of commitments on The Hunt for Red October, and withproduction already underway, Spielberg hit upon the notion of castingAudrey in the role. Audrey, in Spielberg’s words, was “closer to the maternalside of nature,” and intrigued by the chance to work with Spielberg in a majorHollywood production requiring a commitment of only ten days, she signedon. Even if limited to two brief scenes, the part was a good one, and garneredAudrey billing of “Special Appearance By.”

Flying to the United States for the film’s location shoot at an airbase inLibby, Montana, Audrey rented a house, where, it was reported in the papers,a neighbor brought her a large bowl of huckleberries as a welcome-to-the-neighborhood present. The very next day Audrey arrived at the neighbor’shouse with a pie made from the berries.

Happy she was, even if the exact nature of her role remained elusive. Con-fided Audrey mid-production: “Nobody knows what I am, even Steven Spiel-berg! I would say I’m a spirit. But not an extraterrestrial. It’s just plain oldme with a sweater on.” (It’s an amusing comment which speaks to Audrey’sessential modesty. Safe to say, no one else has ever referred to Audrey Hep-burn as “plain old Audrey . . .”) Because it was important that this heavenlyspirit appear absolutely spotless and pristine onscreen, when it came time tofilm her first scene, which was set on an island of grass in the middle of aburned-out forest, four crew members carried Audrey in a chair from her carto the island. It was a fifty-yard trek, and in Spielberg’s word, she was carried

“like the princess she had always been in all of our dreams—right into hermark and into her key light.” Said co-star Richard Dreyfuss: “She was loveand humor and grace and open and knowing. She was perfect.”

To the cast and crew, the airborne entrance seemed just right for a Holly-wood queen, and yet glad as she was to be surrounded by co-workers ofwhom she appeared genuinely fond, even now she remained petrified of step-ping before the cameras: “The last thing you want to be in acting is an intro-vert, which I am. I’ve never loved to perform. Oh, I liked it beforehand—allthe preparation—and I liked it afterword, if it went well. But the thing itself isscary.”

Analyzed Sean after his mother’s death: “She was scared, man, scared.”Reflecting upon those words in later years, he edited himself: “To say shewas scared is the wrong word. It’s too general. She was, however, insecurewhen it came to performing, and in there is the secret ingredient. If you’reconfident and self-assured at all times, you lose the connection—the walkingof the razor’s edge between performance and real life. She never lost thatstage fright and it solidified the connection with her audience.”

When interviewed by Jane Pauley about the film, Audrey herself en-thused: “I had the best time. I had a ball. [Steven] is just the sensitive and hu-morous man I expected.” Director and star engaged in numerous conversa-tions on the set, talks which ranged from movies and children to history, andout of one of those talks came a key image which ultimately informed Spiel-berg’s award-winning Schindler’s List. At one point in that film, as Jewishpeople are being put onto the trains, a little girl in a red coat is startlingly vis-ible, popping out, as she does, from a bleached-out black-and-white back-ground. In Sean’s words: “This comes from a story about her childhood thatmy mother told him during the filming of Always. She told him about seeingpeople being loaded on the trains at the Arnhem Station, and at some point,she saw a little girl with bright red-orange hair whose face was turned to-wards her as she was being loaded into one of those horrible railcars. Thatimage stayed with her for her entire life. The color made it real—it couldhave been her. Spielberg took that story and transformed the girl with red hairinto a girl wearing a bright red coat and put it into the movie.” Speaking ofthose horrific scenes from her childhood, Audrey stated: “I was eleven or so,and all the nightmares I’ve ever had are mingled with that.”

As for Always itself, while the idea of remaking a beloved film for present

day-audiences sounded fine on paper, the resulting movie suffered from apair of major casting flaws. Spielberg, generally so spot on with his choice ofactors, thought of Richard Dreyfuss as a younger generation’s Spencer Tracy,but Dreyfuss, for all of his talent, proved far too jittery an onscreen presenceto ever channel Tracy’s salt-of-the-earth persona. Similarly, Holly Hunter,her rat-a-tat-tat delivery and aggressive stance accentuated by endless gumchewing, misses the pathos inherent in Irene Dunne’s original portrayal ofDorinda. Hunter’s Dorinda does nothing so much as yell—often and loudly—and when this approach was combined with Dreyfuss’s nervous tics, anysense of romance and wonder promptly flew out the window.

What spoke to the home front audience in 1943 when the fate of westerncivilization was hanging in the balance could not land with the same reson-ance when the pilots in question were fighting fires. In the end, Always isstuck in limbo between World War II and 1980s America, with the movie setin the present day yet using vintage World War II planes and archaic 1940sslang like “You big lug.” The clothes may seem reminiscent of the 1940s butDreyfuss and Hunter spell present-day America.

In the end, the constant verbal and visual references to World War II onlymake the stakes at play in Always seem that much smaller. Yes, the shots offirefighting are certainly more believable than the combat shots found in the1943 original, but the overall effect rings false, because Spielberg’s universe,exemplified by the self-conscious banter between the pilots and Dorinda,seems cribbed directly from vintage movies, not real life. If, as seems evidentby 1941, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, Masters of the Air, and ThePacific, Spielberg’s heart truly lies in the 1940s, the last era in which the na-tion was united, then the question remains why he didn’t keep the film set inthat era.

It is therefore up to the character of Hap to supply the sense of genuineemotion missing from most of the film, and in the hands of Audrey Hepburn,that is precisely what happens. No one may have known exactly who andwhat Hap represented, but Hepburn’s performance proves effortless anddeeply moving, a summary of life experience and three decades of movie act-ing which lifts a leaden film into a realm where belief in the afterlife andguardian angels might actually prove possible.

Appearing forty minutes into the film, clad head to toe in white, her hairpulled back and hands clasped as she leans against a tree trunk, Audrey Hep-

burn’s beauty is enhanced not just by her bone structure but also by her age.If, as Eleanor Roosevelt had it, “beautiful young people are an accident cre-ated by nature. Beautiful old people are works of art,” then Audrey Hep-burn’s delicately lined face functions as proof positive of this aphorism. Herquiet, confiding delivery cuts right through all the attendant claptrap in awonderful, all-too-brief performance that instantly makes you realize whatthe rest of the movie does not possess—charm and grace.

As the film lurches toward its finale, Audrey does appear again, instantlygiving viewers a lift throughout the brief three-minute duration of the scene.Unfortunately, her all-too-quick sequence is followed by a bit of psy-chobabble nonsense meant to suggest an understanding of life’s travails, withRichard Dreyfuss gravely informing Holly Hunter that “the love we holdback is the pain that follows us here.” None of it registers, and a viewer’s re-action to having pseudo-philosophy ladled out in such leaden fashion is likelyto run along the lines of Woody Allen’s putdown of pretension: “Did itachieve total heaviosity?”

The critics were not impressed, and while David Denby’s review in NewYork Magazine referred to “Spielberg’s long, long career as a boy,” it was ac-tually Pauline Kael who understood the film’s failings best, saying of Spiel-berg: “He has caught the surface mechanics of $\because 4 0 s$ movies, but has no graspof the simplicity that made them affecting. He overcooks everything, in a faststressful style.” Kael is on the money here, because even the music is of the“nudge-nudge” variety, with A Guy Named Joe’s theme of “I’ll Get By” herereplaced by the too-on-the-nose “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.”

Spielberg’s frenetic, indeed at times bombastic style—as if yelling at theaudience “See how touching this is?!”—only serves to heighten the effective-ness of Audrey’s understated and heartfelt performance. Her portrayal of Happrovides the audience with both an overdue chance to relax into the film aswell as an actual sense of wonder, the essential Spielberg quality found in hisgreatest films like E.T. A filmmaker of enormous talent and often exquisitesensitivity—witness Schindler’s List—has here battered the audience into un-willing submission.

In the end, Audrey’s all-too-brief scenes grant audiences a look at the filmthat might have been. In a lumbering, occasionally tedious film, she had tri-umphed in full, in the process providing a masterful coda to her life inmovies.

# Chapter Forty-NineA RECKONING WITH ANNE FRANK, 1990–1991

“The most important thing I’ve carried through life is that whatever I’vesuffered has helped me later on. When I love, I love unconditionally.”

—Audrey Hepburn

PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE had enjoyed working with Steven Spielberg somuch, or it may have been that she had rediscovered the joys of performing,but Audrey now agreed to return to the stage for the first time in forty years:not to appear in a play, but instead to narrate a symphonic tribute to AnneFrank. By 1990, the timing felt right—at long last, she could honor the youngwoman whose diary had circled, changed, and informed her own life fornearly fifty years.

That history with Anne Frank stretched back to 1946 when the seventeen-year-old Audrey had moved with her mother from Velp to Amsterdam.Mother and daughter settled into an apartment located directly below that ofan editor working on the Dutch publication of The Diary of Anne Frank, andwhen the editor gave the book to Audrey, the teenager proved emotionallydevastated: “There were floods of tears. I became hysterical.”

In many ways, Audrey seemed the natural candidate to play Anne Frank inthe George Stevens–directed movie based upon the Broadway play of thesame name: the two dark-haired girls, only six weeks apart in age, were bornoutside of the Netherlands but raised Dutch, and lived only sixty miles fromeach other during the war. Furthering the connection between the two,Anne’s diary actually contains a direct reference to Audrey’s uncle Otto,Count van Limburg Stirum, one of the first five Dutch civilians executedafter the occupation began. Said Audrey: “I’ve marked one place where shesays, ‘Five hostages shot today.’ That was the day my uncle was shot. And in

this child’s words I was reading about what was inside me and is still there. Itwas a catharsis for me. Anne Frank’s story was my own. . . . This child whowas locked up in four walls had written a full report of everything I’d experi-enced and felt.”

So keen was George Stevens for Audrey’s participation that he asked OttoFrank, Anne’s father, to travel from his home in Zurich to Bürgenstock in or-der to persuade Audrey to star in the film. Recalled Audrey: “He came tolunch and stayed to dinner. He came with his new wife who had lost her hus-band and her children. They both had the numbers on their arms. There wassomething so spiritual about his face. He had been there and back.”

Audrey was hesitant, but at Stevens’s request read the diary again. In herown recall, she “was so destroyed by it again that I said I couldn’t deal withit. It’s a little bit as if this had happened to my sister. I couldn’t play my sis-ter’s life. It’s too close and in a way, she was a soul sister.” Did Audrey feel abit of survivor’s guilt? For such a sensitive, empathetic person it is certainly apossibility, and horrible as Audrey’s war had been, she had moved aboutfreely and not been locked up in an attic.

To a lesser extent, but very likely in the back of Audrey’s mind, playingthe role might also have given more publicity to her mother’s one-time Nazisympathies. It was all too much an unwelcome reminder of the horrible waryears, and Audrey gracefully declined the role, which was subsequentlyplayed by Millie Perkins to great acclaim.

By 1990, however, enough time had passed for Audrey to feel more com-fortable with Anne’s story. The passage of forty-five years had even grantedAudrey a perspective on the occasional good which occasionally arises out ofone’s own personal horror: “In the beginning it’s an enemy, it’s somethingthat you don’t want to face or think about or deal with. Yet with time it be-comes almost a friend. . . . Being without food, fearful for one’s life, thebombings—all made me so appreciative of safety, of liberty. In that sense,the bad experiences have become positive in my life.”

It was time, Audrey felt, to pay tribute to her “soul sister” whose diary hadby then sold over thirty million copies in dozens of languages. A plan wasformulated: Audrey would select passages from the diary, and after he ap-proved them, composer/conductor Michael Tilson Thomas would utilizethem as the basis for composing a musical score. Audrey taped herself read-ing the passages she selected, and such was the power of those home record-

ings that Tilson Thomas readily admitted: “So much of the music, I realizenow, was influenced by hearing the way she read, her voice, her personality.The piece is as much about Audrey as about Anne Frank.”

The key to Audrey’s participation lay in the fact that she would not haveto act or sound like Anne Frank: “I’m just relaying her thoughts. I’m reading.I still wouldn’t play her.” The concerts, entitled From the Diary of AnneFrank, would benefit UNICEF. “Now I’m very happy to read her words,”said the sixty-year-old Audrey. “I’m thrilled to do it because I think it’ssomething very important. They’re very deep and they’re pure because shewas a child, and she wrote them from her heart.” For Audrey, Anne was “asymbol of the child in very difficult circumstances, which is what I devote allmy time to. She transcends her death.”

A schedule was set for a mini tour of the United States in March of 1990,followed by concerts in London two months later. Audrey had not appearedonstage in nearly forty years, but one constant remained: the genuine self-de-precation about her own abilities. After television talk show host Larry Kingtold her she would have delivered a great performance as Anne Frank, shesimply replied: “No, but then I’m not much of an actress . . . I could not havesuffered through that again without destroying myself.”

Each one of her appearances with Tilson Thomas sold out instantly, herappeal undiminished, indeed enhanced, after close to four decades away fromthe stage. Beginning with a March 19, 1990, concert at the PhiladelphiaAcademy of Music, and continuing on to Chicago, Houston, and the UnitedNations General Assembly Hall, Audrey and Tilson Thomas raised hundredsof thousands of dollars at each concert. When the concert was repeated inMay 1991 at London’s Barbican concert hall, critic Sheridan Morley wrote ofher appearance: “Heart-breakingly fragile, looking as though she were madeof glass, she stood in front of that huge orchestra and gave a performance ofsuch mesmerizing dramatic intensity that afterwards I was not alone in beg-ging her to return to the stage she had left at the time of Roman Holiday al-most forty years ago.”

It was never to be.

# Chapter Fifty

# FOR THE LOVE OF GARDENS, 1990–1993

“I think that’s what life is all about—children and flowers.”

—Audrey Hepburn, Gardens of the World

WORN DOWN BY HER INCESSANT globetrotting on behalf of UNICEF, as well asthe back-to-back appearances in Always and From the Diary of Anne Frank,Audrey was looking to remain at home, planning to only emerge periodicallyfor UNICEF fundraising. With only one field trip scheduled in all of 1990,and none for 1991, she continued to think of herself as retired—if not entirelyfrom UNICEF, then certainly from acting. Retired, that is, until an opportun-ity presented itself that proved irresistible: serving as the on-camera host for apublic broadcasting series that would take her on a journey to the world’smost famous and beautiful gardens.

The idea for a Public Broadcasting System (PBS) series about gardens hadoriginated with documentarian and executive producer Janis Blackschleger,who first discussed the series as a multipart presentation without a host.When the production team began to talk about modifying the concept to in-clude a host, it was Julie Leifermann who suggested Audrey, then reemergingin the public eye through Always. Said Blackschleger: “What fascinated mefrom the very beginning was, when you would just say ‘Gardens of theWorld with Audrey Hepburn,’ people’s faces would light up.”

Combining, as it did, her love of gardening and a chance to exercise heron-camera skills, the show proved irresistible to Audrey. Gardens had held animportant place in her worldview from the time she was a youngster: “WhenI didn’t have a dime, I held to the dream of one day having my own orchardwith fruit trees and a place to grow vegetables.” For Audrey, the gardenswere indeed actual works of art: “The arts of the garden, like those of the

theatre, painting, music and dance, nurture and comfort.”

On September 14, 1989, producer Stuart Crowner flew with Blackschlegerto meet with Audrey and Robert Wolders in Tolochenaz. Audrey had just re-turned from an overseas trip on behalf of UNICEF but yes, she informedthem, she was definitely interested in their series. Said Blackschleger: “Hear-ing that beautiful voice, that unique cadence, in person, was extraordinary,and it was wonderful to see how much she cared right from the start. Shewanted to play a role in selecting the gardens to be showcased, to consultwith gardening expert Penelope Hobhouse and to work with the writers onthe script. You can see Audrey’s handwritten notes on script pages.”

In that pre–cell phone era, multiple transatlantic phone calls transpiredbetween the production team in the United States and Audrey and Robbie inSwitzerland. Said producer Blackschleger: “The opening episode, with tulipsand spring bulbs in Holland, was adapted from Audrey’s own notes fromthose transatlantic calls. Sometimes during the conversations, you could hearcowbells in the background!”

Such was Audrey’s enthusiasm for the project that the documentary’s rel-atively low budget did not deter her in the slightest: “I had the time, and I wasthrilled to do it. I love gardens and flowers. It interests me and it gives me anopportunity to see gardens I never would have otherwise. I think we’re photo-graphing what are the most beautiful gardens in the world. It’s really allabout the same things—children, flowers—it’s life, it’s survival, and likewith flowers, it’s the same with children: with a little help they can surviveand stand up and live another day. . . . I put the same effort into helping aplant flourish as we do at UNICEF giving children a future and room to de-velop—the strength to have a future.”

Her fee, she decreed, would be donated to UNICEF, and the gardens, notAudrey, were to be treated as the stars of the show. Her attractive, casual, andsubtly eye-catching clothes would be provided by Ralph Lauren, with whomshe had struck up a deep friendship. Each episode would find Audrey wear-ing two or three different outfits, ranging from a pink two-piece suit to a redsilk shirt and white pants. This represented no turning of her back onGivenchy but rather simply a case of wearing different styles for different oc-casions. Said Audrey: “It’s having the best of both worlds, Hubert, andRalph. I don’t want to compare them. I just want to wear them.”

Mindful of the show’s tight budget, Audrey suggested to producer

Blackschleger that if the show could provide her with a hairdryer and iron,she’d do her own hair, makeup, and wardrobe. Twenty-six years earlier shehad dozens of wardrobe personnel fussing over her on My Fair Lady, andnow she was equally happy to be looking after herself. So happy, in fact, thatJulie Leifermann, who worked on the show as a one-person productionteam/assistant to Audrey, related that Audrey insisted upon ironing Julie’sclothes as well as her own. Said Leifermann: “She genuinely loved the beautyof small things. She was connected to the simplicity of how life could workand tried not to complicate it.”

Her commitment to this show and to nature itself was plainly stated: “Per-haps if we now take a closer look at our gardens, we will better understandour lovely earth. Have we not lost sight of our only source of life? Or havewe at last awakened to the fragility of our beautiful planet.” Celebratingnature was a surefire way to enjoy herself and regain a sense of hope after thehorrors she had faced down in war-torn, poverty-stricken countries. And yet,that UNICEF work all over the globe had actually served to deepen her com-mitment to preserving the natural world: “To plant a garden is to believe intomorrow.”

Audrey felt strongly that the gardens had to be presented not just in abeautiful style but also in a “poetic way.” Blackschleger was not exactly surewhat Audrey meant by the word “poetic,” but she finally came to realize thatthe word tied in with the totality of Audrey’s vision: “She meant a fusion ofarts, garden, people, peace, quiet sky, light . . .”

Filming began on April 23, 1990, in the Netherlands, a segment high-lighted by Audrey’s tearful reunion with her wheelchair-bound aunt Jac-queline at the unveiling of the “Audrey Hepburn White Tulip.” May foundher filming in France and England, and in June there were trips to Japan, theDominican Republic, and the United States. Laughed producer Blackschlegerin later years, “In hindsight I realized that we built a schedule apropos to trav-eling as if we were still in our twenties—which none of us were! But Audrey,Robbie, and the crew were vigorous—real troopers. There was a shared senseof discovery and excitement.”

Audrey downplayed her own gardening skills, but in fact proved know-ledgeable about design, layout, color, and variety, all of which added to theprogram’s effectiveness. Filming was limited to four hours per day: two inthe morning and two in the afternoon, the hours when natural outdoor light-

ing was at its best. Limited shooting hours allowed Audrey to avoid exhaust-ing herself, and the eight resulting twenty-five-minute minifilms showcased arelaxed and radiant star. Each segment was organized around a specific typeof garden (rose, country), and while the off-camera narration was provided byMichael York, Audrey’s own passion for the subject, what Blackschleger de-scribed as her “unerring sense of place,” was made abundantly clear in herenthusiastic descriptions of everything from modern landscaping to the pleas-ure gardens inspired by the Islamic belief in a vast, peaceful heavenly garden.

There was a great rapport, onscreen and off, with Penelope Hobhouse, andin a charming sequence the two women discussed how difficult it was totravel and miss the latest changes in a home garden. Audrey tied that discus-sion back to the beginnings of her own career with a story about Colette: “Idon’t know if you’ve ever read that lovely story about Colette’s mother beinginvited by Colette’s husband to come and stay with them on a certain date.And she wrote back—‘Thank you so much for your sweet invitation. Youknow how much I love my daughter. And my dearest wish is to see her. Buton that very day my cactus will bloom. And it blooms only once every fouryears. And I must stay here.’ And you know, Colette commented on how sheadored her mother for that very quality, how much she loved her flowers. Ican understand that. I really had a hard time leaving.”

For those who followed the series, one extra bonus reminded everyone ofjust how extraordinary an actress Audrey Hepburn could be: at the end of thefourth episode, “Public Gardens and Trees,” Audrey sat down on a bench andread an excerpt from The Diary of Anne Frank in which Anne writes abouther love of nature. And there, in the midst of a beautiful garden setting, sixty-year-old Audrey Hepburn read with the enthusiasm and unbridled joy of afourteen-year-old girl, never attempting to act fourteen, but rather conveyingthe essence of young Anne Frank. It served as a potent reminder of just howextraordinary an Anne Frank she would have been thirty-three years earlier inthe George Stevens film.

Audrey completed voiceover work in January of 1991 in Los Angeles, thememory of her arrival at the recording studio etched in Blackschleger’s mindthirty years later: “What I remember most vividly was Audrey arriving withJulie Leifermann in an Alfa Romeo convertible with the top down—it wasjust like Audrey on the Vespa in Roman Holiday!” Even at this late stage ofher participation, Audrey’s commitment remained absolute. Remembers

Blackschleger: “Audrey was so involved that it was she who changed thescript description of the orangery at Versailles from ‘parade ground soldiers’to ‘parade ground sentinels.’ Every word mattered.”

In the spring of 1991, an introductory version of Gardens of the Worldaired to great acclaim as a PBS fundraiser. It was only after a lengthy editingprocess that the first episode actually aired; the date was January 21, 1993,the day after Audrey died. Typical of the highly favorable reviews was Bar-bara Saltzman exclaiming in the Los Angeles Times: “Hard to imagine any[episode] more compelling than the half hour spent wandering through someof the world’s most enchanting rose gardens with one of the world’s most en-chanting women.”

At the 1993 Emmy Awards, Audrey was awarded a posthumous Emmyfor “Outstanding Individual Achievement in Informational Programming,”with her award being accepted by Janis Blackschleger. The series lived on ina 2006 reissue on DVD, as well as a CD release of music from the series, andBlackschleger proudly points to the prescient nature of the programs: “Manyof the ideas Audrey most cared about introducing in the series thirty yearsago are more relevant today than ever—the well-being of our planet, andwhat kind of natural world we are leaving for future generations.”

Given Audrey’s love of gardens, the series seemed a fitting conclusion toher life on camera, leading Robbie Wolders to state: “I know that for Audreythe making of Gardens of the World was not only a marvelous adventure, butalso one of the most rewarding experiences of her life and career. It becamean intensely personal and creative process for her.” The program came to as-sume that same significance in Wolders’s life as well: “Someone asked merecently if it’s painful for me to watch film on Audrey, and I realized that ingeneral it is, except for when it is Gardens of the World. That is, I think, be-cause having gone to the locations with Audrey, having shared the experi-ence, seeing the film becomes more like the revisiting of beautiful memor-ies.”

Yet for all the series’ acclaim, it was not Audrey’s on-camera skills thatmade production of the series so enjoyable. It was instead the warmth of adown-to-earth, international star who remained interested in others more thanin talking about herself. In the words of Janis Blackschleger: “We all knowAudrey Hepburn is a great legend. But what she was, more than a great le-gend, was a great human being. When you were with her you felt prettier,

better about yourself and your own possibilities.” Musing about Audrey’s af-fect and impact years later, she added: “So many times I am asked, ‘Whatwas she really like?’ And my answer is that she had such respect for life andfor others. Audrey always looked forward. She possessed the most life-af-firming way of living, of being wholeheartedly present in this world. She wasextraordinary.”

Said her good friend, photographer Bob Willoughby: “She left those whocame into contact with her better for having known her. I miss her to thisday.”

“She gives the distinct impression she can spell schizophrenia.”

—Billy Wilder on Audrey Hepburn

AUDREY’S WELL-RECEIVED TURNS IN ALWAYS and From the Diary of Anne Frankhad reawakened the film community to her unique charms, and lifetimeachievement awards soon began to flow her way. Such evenings of celebra-tion seemed a graceful way to pay tribute to a legendary star, and alsoprovided a way of thanking Audrey for her own willing participation in galashonoring her great friends in Hollywood.

She had, along the way, participated in the 1981 American Film Institute(AFI) tribute to Cary Grant and attended no fewer than four galas honoringGivenchy in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Tokyo. In 1986 shetook part in the AFI tribute to Billy Wilder and spoke at several benefits hon-oring her close friend Gregory Peck, even hosting the 1989 AFI tribute to herfirst co-star. All of which made it seem a logical progression that the biggestand most prestigious film organizations in the world decided it was time topay homage to Audrey herself.

On October 21, 1987, she was honored at the New York City Museum ofModern Art’s benefit for film preservation, and three years later, the GoldenGlobes awarded her the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. Ina charming acceptance speech Audrey rattled off the names of no fewer thanthirty-five people who had helped her career, and in a sign of how difficultlife remained for women in Hollywood, only two of those listed were womenShirley MacLaine and Lillian Gish.

The biggest honor of all, however, took place at an April 22, 1991, tributeat the Film Society of Lincoln Center. Famous co-stars and directors lined up

to pay tribute, not just to her beauty and talent, but above all else, her kind-ness. Said the supposedly tough Billy Wilder: “You looked around and sud-denly there was this dazzling creature looking like a wild-eyed doe prancingin the forest. Everybody on the set was in love with her in five minutes, I in-cluded.” Proving he had lost none of his trademark wit, he added: “My prob-lem was that I am a guy who speaks in his sleep. I toss around and talk andtalk . . . but fortunately my wife’s first name is Audrey as well.”

Fulsome tributes followed from Gregory Peck (“It was my good luck dur-ing that summer in Rome to be the first of her cinema swains”), Tony Per-kins, Harry Belafonte, and ever the humorous cynic, Audrey’s three-time dir-ector Stanley Donen, who added: “My passion for her has lasted through fourmarriages—two of hers and two of mine.” If, in her modesty, Audrey alwaysclaimed, “I had to do it with feeling instead of technique,” it was Alan Arkinwho smilingly disagreed with the honoree: “She does not think of herself as aparticularly good actress, but she is a consummate one, whether she likes it ornot.” Reflecting on that night decades later, Arkin added: “The only time Isaw her after filming Wait Until Dark was at the Lincoln Center Tribute. Iapologized to Audrey for having been as horrible as I was to her while play-ing the character of Roat. That role was actually depressing to me. And whenI said this to Audrey she said: ‘Nonsense! It was the role. Don’t worry oreven think about it.’”

Reflecting on his co-star’s legacy, Arkin reflected: “I think she’s revered,but for all her considerable skill, people seem to think about who she is morethan about her acting chops. I disagree with that but it’s understandable. Shewas of such impeccable character, so much greater than any person she wasplaying. Not many people in the business make it feel honorable, but she did.She really was what a human being should be.”

As for Audrey herself, whether at the Lincoln Center tribute or that of theUSA Film Festival in Dallas, the attention served to make her almost uneasy:“It’s wonderful, but at the same time you don’t know where to put yourself.You just die in a way. I mean, all those compliments . . . It’s like eating toomuch chocolate cake all at once.” What the tributes made clear, however, wasthat her small but substantial film career, encompassing twenty-two majorroles, featured a range much larger than is often remembered: playing a nun,blind woman, quasi lesbian, princess, flower girl, prostitute, and guardian an-gel, she managed to convince audiences to accept her in every one of those

varied guises. Said Stanley Donen: “She approached acting with determina-tion, intelligence, and a lack of selfishness I have rarely seen.”

In accepting all her honors, the closest she would ever come to acknow-ledging her own extraordinary talent was simply to humorously state: “I thinkit was quite wonderful that this skinny broad could be turned into a market-able commodity.” Asked about her own favorite movie, she offered a some-what surprising choice: After first demurring that “it’s like asking if I likechocolate cake more than spaghetti,” this time she selected My Fair Lady—“Iloved working with music. The reason I wanted to dance was because I lovedmusic. Music is the greatest helper in the world in all situations.”

In March of 1992 she was presented with a special BAFTA LifetimeAchievement Award by Princess Anne, and that same year brought her theGeorge Eastman Award for distinguished contribution to the art of film. Butrather than bask in the glow of past achievements, she now remained focusedupon one final piece of work that held special meaning for her as the climaxof her performing career: Audrey Hepburn would narrate fairy tales in a spe-cial audio recording for children.

# Chapter Fifty-TwoSOLO VOCE, 1992

“Audrey’s voice has always been rich with poignancy for me, a quiet yetlively sound tinged with a taste of sadness.”

—Esperanza Miyake

WITH THE FILMING OF Gardens of the World completed, Audrey’s last ever pub-lic appearance in a professional capacity occurred in March 1992, when shepresented an honorary Academy Award to director Satyajit Ray. SaidVanessa Redgrave: “I was in Los Angeles at one of those hotels where theyhold the awards ceremonies and I saw Audrey. I knew she had cancer and Ithink everyone knew it. What struck me again was that she was very, veryhumble.”

Presenting the award to Satyajit Ray may have been Audrey’s last everpublic appearance in a professional capacity, but she had undertaken one lastacting job—just not in front of a camera. Instead, she agreed to narrate a se-lection of four fairy tales for Dove Audio Books, with all royalties flowing tothe ASPCA.

The idea for this recording had originated with pianist Mona Golabek andwriter Mary Sheldon, with Sheldon writing adaptations of Sleeping Beauty,Tom Thumb, Laidronette—Empress of the Pagoes, and Beauty and the Beast.Audrey agreed very quickly to participate in these recordings—fairy tales,after all, were a source of comfort for children, and it turns out, for Audreyherself: “If I’m honest, I have to tell you I still read fairy tales and I like thembest of all.” It was no accident that Audrey always listed Frances HodgsonBurnett’s The Secret Garden as her all-time favorite book.

It wasn’t just Audrey’s star power that Golabek wanted—it was the es-sence of the woman herself: “She had a quality I found in Eleanor Roosevelt.

When Audrey said to you ‘How are you, dear?’ she looked in your eyes andwanted an answer. . . . There were differences between her and Eleanor, butthey both built instant bridges to anyone they were with. What they wantedwas your soul.”

Audrey Hepburn’s Enchanted Tales, as the recording came to be known,represented a near perfect fit of actress and material, with Audrey’s soothingvoice—comforting, all embracing, yet full of life—building nothing less thanan aural cocoon. Such is the power of that unique voice that when she whis-pers the phrase “the softest of sheets” the very texture of those sheets provesnear palpable. Said the Los Angeles Times: “Hepburn shapes the rich lan-guage with delicate clarity and her unique, captivating charm. The rest is puremagic.” What Ernest Hemingway wrote about Marlene Dietrich here appliedto Audrey Hepburn just as much: “If she had nothing more than her voice,she could break your heart with it.”

When the successful release of the recording led to a 1994 GrammyAward for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, Audrey became the firstactress to complete the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards)posthumously. The first of her major awards had come in the 1950s with theOscar and Tony, and now, forty years later, a year after her death, she hadcompleted the grand slam of entertainment awards with an Emmy for Gar-dens of the World and a Grammy for Enchanted Tales.

This status as a beloved icon was far from just a posthumous honor; backin 1968, fourteen years after her last performance on Broadway, she had beenhonored with a special Tony Award for “Lifetime Achievement in theTheatre.” In other words, Audrey was already so revered that she received thecommercial theatre’s highest award—for essentially turning her back ontheatre for the world of films and Hollywood . . .

When she walked onstage to receive her special Tony, the theatre audiencewas clearly thrilled to see her in person, and she immediately captivatedeveryone in sight with a typically self-deprecating and thoroughly charmingassessment of herself in Gigi: “A rather thin girl with a rather thin talent.”

Audrey insisted upon one final UNICEF trip—a field visit to war-torn Somalia in 1992.Photofest


# Chapter Fifty-ThreeSOMALIA, 1992

“My mother had a secret. . . . She was sad. My mother was sad because ofwhat she saw happening to the children of the world.”

—Sean Hepburn Ferrer

BY 1992, AUDREY WAS EXHAUSTED, worn out, and alarmingly thin, with RogerMoore, who once again co-hosted the Danny Kaye Children’s Awards withher, noting: “I should have been more aware of Audrey’s failing health at thattime. She was always desperately thin, but now she seemed to be very fragiletoo, and had to sit down quite often.”

Exhaustion and all, Audrey had one final UNICEF trip in mind: if, in theaftermath of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, Somalia had become the mostbroken country on earth, then she needed to visit Somalia. By 1992, one-quarter million Somalis had died of hunger and thirst, which meant that forAudrey there was no “if” about it—she had to see the living conditions facingthe country’s children for herself. In her own words, spoken directly to a re-porter early in the year: “I’m not playing a role. Roles are imaginary andfantasy. There’s no fantasy to this. It’s tough, heartbreaking reality.”

In the face of Somalia’s marauding violent gangs and lack of a functioninggovernment, it was far from a given that Audrey would even receive permis-sion to visit. Which meant that after UNICEF fundraising trips to San Fran-cisco, Chicago, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Indianapolis, and Providence, shereturned home to rest and, as the summer wore on, grew increasingly anxiousabout whether she would be permitted to visit Somalia. Finally, word arrivedfrom UNICEF: she would be allowed into Somalia at the end of summer. Thedangers she would face on the ground alarmed everyone but Audrey, and inthe analysis of Ian MacLeod, who was tapped to accompany her on the trip:

“We didn’t publicize Audrey coming in advance or there could have been asecurity risk. . . . In terms of Audrey coming in, that information was on aneed-to-know basis.”

UN passport in hand, she boarded a flight on September 20 from Nairobito the Somali city of Kismayo. There were, in fact, no visas provided for hervisit because, she was told by a UNICEF official: “There is no government.You just fly in and hope you won’t get shot down.”

Audrey’s flight touched down in a countryside filled with poisoned wellsand thousands of armed men; outside the capital of Mogadishu there wereneither schools nor hospitals, in fact nothing at all in the way of govern-mental institutions. Drought, civil war, nonexistent roads, and a total lack ofsanitation were now the norm throughout the country.

When she visited feeding centers, she was confronted by the sight of list-less children literally starving to death. Followed throughout by a UN videocamera, it took an effort of will for her to keep moving forward, but she didnot flinch. Said photographer Betty Press, who accompanied her on the trip:“What amazed me most of all was how she handled herself in these campswhere they were desperate. . . . The situation at that point was so tragic, andshe handled herself with such grace and such dignity. You’d see smiles onpeople who had nothing to smile about. . . . She really cared.”

Arriving back in Mogadishu, Audrey was confronted with a capital cityenveloped in total chaos. She had lived through the destruction of Arnhem,but this, she knew, was far worse: “I’ve never seen a whole city where thereisn’t a building that doesn’t have holes in it or a roof on it. The city was atotal battleground.” She visited a hospital and school, and when the sound ofmachine guns rang alarmingly close to the hospital, such was the extent ofthe violence that no one even turned a head. No matter the psychic cost, shestayed the course, telling the clinical staff: “Wherever I go in the world Iwork for UNICEF, but I always talk about you, because I’m full of admira-tion, and your courage has been incredible.” She seemed increasingly frailbut refused to stop. Said Betty Press: “I could tell it was hard for her even toget down to the children’s level. She would do that, but it was hard.”

She did have one brief respite when she helicoptered onto the flight deckof the aircraft carrier Tarawa to thank those onboard for their help in protect-ing UNICEF workers. The servicemen and -women on board had collected$\$ 4,000$ as a donation to UNICEF, a gesture which left Audrey in tears. She

was to refer to this donation many times, as if reassuring herself that after thesights she was confronted with in Somalia, good people did still exist.

She had one more Somalian stop, in the city of Baidoa, ground zero for thecountry’s devastating famine. Shops had been looted and deserted, dead bod-ies littered the ground, and in Audrey’s own despairing words: “I walked intoa nightmare.” The children were now so weak that they could neither feedthemselves nor make the slightest noise, and by Ian MacLeod’s estimate, tenchildren died in the one hour he and Audrey spent watching the charity work-ers from “Concern” feed and tend Somalian children. Something inside ofAudrey broke: “The silence is something you never forget.” She felt hauntedby the absence of joy: “And to see the children that quiet it’s awful.” Shakento her core, she murmured “you really wonder if God hasn’t entirely forgot-ten Mogadishu.”

When pressed on French television for an explanation of that comment,she simply stated: “I have a tendency at times in my life, wonderful or awful,of turning to God.” But as for God being responsible for the horrors, abso-lutely not—the blame, Audrey fiercely explained, lay entirely with man:“Drought is not what causes famine, it’s man. . . . In the end, hate is the mostevil thing in the world, and it begins with us. Children are born loving. Theylove. And racism, discrimination, hate are given by us. What’s so bad inAfrica is that they were given their independence without the tools, becausein Somalia there is only ten percent of the population that is able to read andwrite.”

Somalia pervaded her consciousness, and for the first time, the utterdrenching loss of it all overwhelmed her. How, she wondered, could we havefashioned a world where war takes precedence over showing children thatthey are loved. She had reached her limit, the exhaustion caused by five yearsof work under the most wretched of conditions cracking her empathetic es-sence. In the apt words of Robert Matzen who chronicled her work forUNICEF in Warrior: Audrey Hepburn, “Drop by drop, she began to dole outher life force to those she met, a drop here and a drop there . . .” 

She was fearful, terrified even, that nothing had been learned from the hor-rors of the Second World War. Forty-seven years after that war’s end, shefound herself surrounded once again by unwelcome reminders of the starva-tion and misery that had haunted her own adolescence: “The children . . .their eyes were like enormous pools of question . . . as if they are asking

‘Why?’ Some of the children have no light in their eyes. . . . I am becomingmore raw, more hurt, more angry, feeling the pain more deeply. It’s really notto be believed how these people live . . .”

The hypersensitivity which left her feeling like an open nerve had beennoted as far back as 1960 by her friend and Children’s Hour co-star ShirleyMacLaine: “Audrey was the kind of person who when she saw someone elsesuffering, tried to take the pain on herself.” By now, so widespread was thesuffering that Audrey was far from the only relief worker who felt assaultedby the unrelenting misery: John Isaac reported that he found himself so upsetafter a trip to Rwanda that he went into therapy and “couldn’t function. I wastotally stunned.”

Pictures of Audrey carrying a starving child now appeared around theworld. Gone was even the slightest trace of weltschmerz, replaced instead bya fierce soldier. For the first time in her forty years of public life, AudreyHepburn looked angry. More than angry: outraged and not caring who knewit—in fact wanting everyone to know it. Writing a Newsweek article after hertrip to Somalia entitled “Unforgettable Silence,” she painted a picture of ab-ject hopelessness: “There were no small children. They had all been snuffedout like candles. . . . I’m filled with a rage at ourselves. I don’t believe in col-lective guilt, but I do believe in collective responsibility.”

The UNICEF footage in which she talks about Somalia revealed a differ-ent Audrey. She appeared so upset by the horrors she had witnessed, sotouched in the deepest, most caring part of herself, that her face, nearlydevoid of light, appears as a virtual mask of suffering. She is shown kissingthe hands of emaciated children so bereft of nutrition that they remain virtu-ally unrecognizable as little boys and girls: “I wanted to pick up the childrenand give them warmth but you’re afraid you’re going to break them. It istotally unacceptable to see children die before your eyes.”

She had seen suffering and abject poverty on previous trips, but after thetrip to Somalia, a watershed had been reached, as if the ground had crumbledbeneath her and she was plummeting ever downward. In her own stunnedwords: “I have been to hell and back.”

The horrors she felt she must describe in order to jolt people out of theirindifference had rattled her to her core; disturbed himself by the trip, RobertWolders understood why Audrey was so traumatized by what she experi-enced: “It’s a love for people that goes beyond sympathy. It is perhaps more

than empathy. An ability to project her imagination so that she could actuallyfeel what others are feeling.”

She confided to Anna Cataldi that she couldn’t sleep: “I have nightmares.I’m crying all the time.” She could no longer hide her despair: “I’ve alwaysbeen fairly sensitive, but I think at this point I have had an overdose of suffer-ing. That’s why I do need to go home and do other things.” Her emotionaldevastation seemed overwhelming, yet she determinedly told Cataldi: “Wardidn’t kill me, and this won’t either.” But—the cumulative weight of bearingwitness to so much tragedy could not help but take a toll, and in Cataldi’s in-terpretation: “I had this feeling that sooner or later, war kills you. She was soskinny. I felt something was really wrong.”

In a final irony, if a trip to hell can in any way ever be considered a suc-cess, Audrey’s presence in Somalia had proved to be a fundraising triumph,and she followed the work in Somalia with a trip to Kenya, where she sat forinterviews with two dozen journalists at an official press conference. Thiswas, Audrey felt, her best chance to spread word of the Somalian disasterthrough the BBC, Reuters, and Visnews. Her overarching message remainedone of urgency: “There is an immediate need for food, medicines and funds—right now!” She refused to let the world’s wealthiest nations off the hook,bluntly stating of European colonialism: “We didn’t help where education isconcerned and now we’re paying the price. We enriched ourselves on theback of these people. Drought is a tragedy of nature, but famine is not. . . .We all have blood on our hands.”

After her trip she held further press conferences in Geneva, Paris, andLondon, with the United Nations reporting that her mission to Somalia hadraised 1 million pounds in the United Kingdom alone. Her interview in Pariswith Jean-Pierre Elkabbach for the television show Reperes laid bare her dis-tress, the footage revealing a star who can barely speak above a whisper: “Ithink that in the end I won’t be able to overcome this trip . . . to smell thedeath, seeing corpses . . . these tiny little faces. It’s unbearable.” When fol-lowing up on British television she sadly confessed: “I haven’t slept at nightsince then. I sometimes sleep during the day, but I’m having a hard time atnight.”

Perhaps she herself had a premonition of how sick she would soon be-come, and in an April 1991 interview at La Paisible, she told Alan Riding ofthe New York Times Paris bureau: “I’m running out of gas . . . I’ve done it on

a constant basis because I know I cannot keep it up for long.” She could pre-tend no longer: “Much as I love doing this for UNICEF, it’s exhausting and itcreates enormous stress . . . Because it’s a huge responsibility. Lots of work,lots of physical work, traveling, fund-raising, but also lots of preparing.”

She was worn out—by her travels, by the weight of caring for her mother,and by years of nonstop smoking. Her body was breaking down, and it startedto become sadly and ironically clear that her greatest triumph as a humanit-arian, drawing the world’s attention to the nightmare of Somalia, had resultedin physical decline and emotional devastation. In an interview with FairchildNews Services she sadly admitted: “I’m scared.”

Her work for UNICEF and her relentless advocacy on behalf of theworld’s most helpless children had changed her worldview. She lookedpoliticians, warlords, and the military straight in the eye and found them alllacking. The Audrey of forty years earlier who floated through Hollywood,idolized by millions as proof that fairy tales did come true, would not haverecognized the tough-talking soldier she had become: “Serenity—I don’tthink it exists. [You] can be perfectly serene, then you spend two minutesthinking about the Kurds and want to shoot yourself. I mistakenly thoughtthat with age comes serenity, when your job is done. . . . Perhaps the onlytime you can be serene is when you are very small, when you don’t know allthese things.”

Serene she wasn’t. Brimming with happiness about the state of the worldshe wasn’t. But clear in her understanding of what truly mattered in life, un-flinching in her commitment to helping the world’s most dispossessed, thatshe was.

In her search for a path toward healing, Audrey Hepburn had acquiredwisdom.

“If my world were to cave in tomorrow, I would look back on all the pleas-ures, excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to havehad. Not the sadness, not my miscarriages or my father leaving home, butthe joy of everything else. It will have been enough.”

—Audrey Hepburn

WHILE IN SOMALIA, AUDREY HAD begun to feel ill, telling Anna Cataldi, “I have alot of pain in my stomach. I think it’s malaria.” It was clear that her healthwas compromised, and in John Isaac’s recall, “She knew something waswrong but she never talked about it. She kept it to herself.”

Returning to Tolochenaz on September 30, she continued to feel rundown, unable to bounce back the way she had from all her previous trips. Shemanaged a flight to California in October, staying with Connie Wald and see-ing Connie’s doctor, and then flew to Rochester, New York, on October 24for the Eastman Awards. Soldiering through the black-tie benefit, she atten-ded a screening of Breakfast at Tiffany’s the next night, but she was in greatpain.

After receiving word from doctors in Los Angeles that tests confirmed shehad contracted a parasitic infection, she nonetheless traveled to New YorkCity with Robbie on October 27 to receive yet another honor for her humanit-arian work, this one from the Casita Maria Settlement House.

Obligations fulfilled, she flew back to California for a series of doctor’sappointments arranged with the help of Connie Wald, and exploratory sur-gery was scheduled for November 2, 1992. Recalled Sean: “It wasn’t untilshe came to Los Angeles and none of the treatments were working that theydid a small laparoscopy and found that the cancer had spread to her intest-

ines.” A malignant tumor was removed but the abdominal cancer had spreadto her stomach: Audrey had contracted an extremely rare form of cancer-pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), which strikes only one person in every mil-lion. The cancer had metastasized around her intestines and colon, resultingin extreme pain and an inability to eat as the cancer strangled her small intest-ine. She was, just like the children in Somalia, starving to death, and was nowplaced on total parenteral nutrition, with liquids being fed to her intraven-ously.

Sean himself later made a perceptive analysis of the dichotomy betweenhis mother’s extraordinary ability to access emotions as an actress, a skillwhich had aided her career, and her emotional reaction to the suffering ofchildren, which seemed to have now damaged her health. “The emotionswould flood her. She was much more aware of people’s pain than anotherperson would be. Other people could somehow shut off the emotions, but sheinstinctively read the emotions of all those children who were suffering. Shewanted to protect them.”

In addition to feelings of vulnerability dating from her wartime experi-ences, there may, in fact, have been a biological basis for Audrey’s ex-traordinarily high degree of empathy. Audrey, it seems, typified those ex-amined by Dr. Abigail Marsh of Georgetown University for her study ofminute structures in the brain known as amygdalae. Explained Dr. Marshabout the amygdalae: “One of the big things that we know they do is they’reresponsible for generating the experience of fear. What’s interesting aboutthat is that not only is the amygdala essential for giving you the experience offear, it seems to allow you to empathize with other people’s fear. . . . Peoplewho have given kidneys to strangers have an exaggerated response in theamygdala, which we think means that they are more sensitive than mostpeople to others’ distress.” Studying the amygdalae’s structure in people whoimmediately spring into action to help those in trouble, Dr. Marsh explained,“I was really pleased and gratified by what we found in the heroic rescuers,which is that, just like the altruistic kidney donors, their amygdalas [sic] werelarger than average and significantly more responsive to the sight of some-body else in distress . . . you know these are the people who, when they sawsomebody terrified because they thought they were about to die, they didn’tjust sit there.”

Audrey had seen children suffering and starving to death in the world’s

poorest countries, and just as explained by Dr. Marsh, literally could not sitby and watch. Said Sean: “I’m sure it took a huge toll on her emotionally,physically, and in terms of her immune system. She had so many shots—toomany shots—that she needed in order to travel to all those different countries.It’s also possible that during the war she picked up something that triggeredthe cancer. There are environmental cancers, cancers of genetics, of bacteria;there are many different types but my mother’s rare cancer—PMP—acts dif-ferently. There is no tumor mass because the cancer liquifies the tissues of theintestines.”

Faced with the devastating news about her cancer, Audrey reacted just asshe had when deserted by her father—she refused to indulge in self-pity.Which did not mean she simply shrugged and accepted her fate; as related inrather heartbreaking detail by Sean: “She had tears in her eyes, hugged me,sobbed, and whispered: ‘Oh Seanie. I’m so scared.’ I stood there, holding herwith all my might as I felt huge chunks of me falling inside.”

As the reality of her condition sunk in, it was not fear of death that con-sumed Audrey but a fear of unnecessary pain. The pain, Sean promised her,would always be managed. There would be no suffering. Givenchy, whonoted her almost serene air, explained with an understandable touch of hyper-bole, that she was able to accept her illness “because she accomplishedeverything with perfection.”

There was no talk of God and heaven; Ella may have periodically em-braced Christian Science, but Audrey never did practice a specific religion,stating: “My only religion is a belief in nature.” In her worldview, it was anappreciation for the beauty of nature that approached the sacred, but evenwithout an adherence to organized religion, a personal belief persisted: “I amno longer a Christian Scientist, but I believe in something—in the strength,maybe, of the human spirit.” That belief had been tested by the war, by hertravels on behalf of UNICEF, and now by her own suffering, yet she, likeAnne Frank, persisted in a belief that “in spite of everything people are trulygood at heart.”

Very few were allowed to visit her in the hospital; besides Wolders, Sean,and Luca, Gregory Peck, Connie Wald, and Elizabeth Taylor constituted theinner Hollywood circle allowed access. The friendship with Taylor haddeepened over the years, and different as the two screen legends were—onethe epitome of conspicuous consumption and a private life lived through

newspaper headlines, the other shy, reticent, and happiest out of the spotlight—the two women had bonded throughout the years, each sensing in the othera refusal to play the Hollywood game according to the rules of the day. Theyalso shared a bawdy sense of humor, as when Audrey, taking note of adazzling jewel Taylor was sporting, pointed to the bauble and, referring to afamous jeweler, inquired: “Kenny Lane?” “No,” replied Taylor—“RichardBurton.”

Both women were great beauties who had reached the peak of their on-screen popularity in the late ’50s and early 1960s, both had demanding moth-ers who were Christian Scientists, and, most notably, both devoted the lastyears of their lives to charitable causes: Audrey to UNICEF, and ElizabethTaylor to the fight against AIDS. In fact, explaining her fierce dedication tofighting the scourge of AIDS, Taylor utilized words remarkably similar inspirit to those used by Audrey to explain her devotion to UNICEF: “If peoplewant to come to an AIDS event to see whether I’m fat or thin, pretty or not,or really have violet eyes, then great, just come. My fame finally makes senseto me.”

But it was Robbie and her two sons who spent the most time with Audrey,and even during periods of great pain, her thoughtfulness remained undimin-ished; when she was still in the hospital, and Robbie spent nights sleeping ona cot in her room, she asked a nurse if they could please bring him a foammattress to ease his discomfort.

Discharged from the hospital at her own request, she rested at the home ofConnie Wald, and her devoted maid Giovanna Orunesu flew in with two ofAudrey’s dogs. It was at Connie’s house that President George H. W. Bushreached Audrey by phone to tell her that he was awarding her the PresidentialMedal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor granted in the United States.She managed to come to the phone to speak to the president, but it was clearthat she would never be able to travel to Washington, DC, for the medal cere-mony. Faced with intense pain, Audrey agreed to a second exploratory sur-gery on December 9, but the cancer had spread to such a degree that no fur-ther action could be taken.

There was a final conversation with great friend Billy Wilder, and decid-ing against any further chemotherapy she told Luca: “I’m sorry, but I’mready to go.” Sean, Luca, and Robert Wolders then banded together to fulfillher wish to be home for Christmas; too weak for a commercial flight, on

December 21 she was transported home to Switzerland in Bunny Mellon’sprivate jet, a flight which had been arranged through Givenchy’s friendshipwith the wealthy Mellon.

Back in 1976, in that one joint interview with Andrea Dotti, Audrey hadthought aloud about the very idea of existence: “Living is like tearing througha museum. Not until later do you really start absorbing what you saw, think-ing about it, looking it up in a book and remembering—because you can’ttake it all in at once.” And, as the end neared, what exactly did she see in themuseum of her own life? Her two beloved sons. Robert Wolders. The neg-lected children of the world. Her mother and perhaps even her father. Closefriends—the circle of people who had helped her avoid an end she had al-ways feared: “I think it’s one of the great tragedies in this world—the oldwho are lonely. It isn’t age or even death that one fears, as much as lonelinessand the lack of affection.” Even as she lay dying, her concern remained forothers more than for herself. Family friend Marilena Pilat noted: “She wasvery sick and yet she asked me how I felt. She was very peaceful. Usuallyyou are afraid but she wasn’t.”

Ensconced at home, with Sean and Robbie administering the intravenousfeedings and pain medications, Audrey was surrounded by family and cosset-ted in love. Explained Sean: “I would sit in a wicker chair next to her bed inthe last few weeks of her life—we talked about those things that mattered toher. I think she always felt throughout her life that she had shortcomings. Shefelt the mistake was to sit there and hold a grudge. She had to make peacewith life because she didn’t have a choice. She often said it was fortunate tonot have a choice—to have to move forward.”

Although Audrey and Andrea Dotti had by now been divorced for over tenyears, Dotti came to visit Audrey in her final days. Their shared love of Lucameant that mother, father, and son could spend some of her final days to-gether. Wrote Luca of that sad time: “I only learned afterward that he faintedwhen he read my mother’s medical charts. He had understood right away thatthere was nothing more to be done to save her life.”

Still, attentive as they were, all three of Audrey’s “boys”—Sean, Luca,and Robbie—held regrets. For Robbie, the self-perceived mistakes, especiallywhen Audrey first fell ill, proved dark: “Neither the boys nor I could acknow-ledge that she was dying. We perhaps made a mistake in not telling her howill she was. I think that was very unfair to her, because Audrey was as real-

istic about death as she was about life.” With the hindsight of years, however,Wolders came to realize that Audrey was likely not only aware of the severityof her condition but in fact protecting her loved ones: “It’s been my suspicionover the years that she wanted to hide her knowledge of her condition fromus. She never feared death. She told Sean she was afraid only of pain.”

Like all loving children, Luca and Sean regretted their inability to spendmore time with their mother, angry and saddened that they were losing herwhen she was only sixty-three. The lack of time had, in fact, been onAudrey’s own mind as far back as her 1987 television movie Love AmongThieves, when an interviewer asked her what she’d like to change about her-self: “I’d like to be ten years younger. I don’t care about getting older—butI’d like to have a little more time.”

In Luca’s words: “The only big regret I have and she would have had isnot knowing her grandchildren. Because she would have been a fantasticgrandmother—cooking cakes, keeping the grandchildren on every occasion,and telling them stories.” In Sean’s view, if Audrey had even one more dayon earth, she’d hug both of her sons first and then “she would again talkabout those children.”

Audrey had made her understanding of the situation clear, gently issuingfinal instructions to her sons, insisting that they not be angry, and telling themthat her ending was natural, “that death was a natural part of life.” WhileWolders could not accept such a cruel fate befalling “someone so precious,”Audrey was, he related, much more realistic: “She’d say, ‘Why not me?’”When he wondered aloud if it would have been wiser not to have traveled sorelentlessly to the poverty-stricken countries where she faced extreme condi-tions, Audrey simply replied: “Think of all we would have missed.”

Shortly before Christmas, there were last walks through her belovedgarden, once with Givenchy, who had arrived for a final visit, and then againwhen accompanied by Robert, Doris Brynner, and her gardener GiovanniOrunesu. When Giovanni spoke hopefully of future plans for the garden—“Signora, when you get better, will you come and help me plant and trimagain?”—Audrey simply replied that yes, she certainly would help him, “butnot like before.” Accepting her fate, and comforted by the knowledge that inthe perennial cycle of death and rebirth her flowers would bloom yet again,she achieved a certain peace—an unspoken acknowledgment of the verycircles of life.

She summoned a bit of strength on that final Christmas Eve and was, withher IV pole, able to come downstairs for a few hours. By now Audrey was ona constant morphine drip to ease the pain and could not leave the house. Ex-plained Sean: “She couldn’t go out and shop . . . so she went into her closet tofind something in order to give us each something that was hers. That made itso touching, so magical.”

She spoke of a favorite quotation from the Bengali poet RabindranathTagore: “Each child is a reminder that God has not lost hope in man.” Therewas a final reading of a favorite text, “The Beauty of a Woman”; written asletters to his daughter and subsequently to his newly born granddaughter,Sam Levenson’s words had been adapted into a poem by Audrey, who en-titled it “Time Tested Beauty Tips” (after a line in Levenson’s letter). Nowmore than ever it seemed to sum up her entire philosophy of life while encap-sulating her own spirit:

For attractive lips, speak words of kindness.

For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.

For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry.

By now her life had come full circle, and in Sean’s words: “I think shespent a large portion of her life thinking she wasn’t worthy of all that affec-tion and the love.” And yet, in the end peace and self-acceptance had beenachieved: “[But] that last Christmas, one of the great things she said was thatshe was sure that we loved her . . . after everything we had been through to-gether. It meant a lot for us to know that she could go with that in her heart.”

When she went to bed on her last Christmas Eve, she told Robbie Woldersit had been the best Christmas of her life.

Surrounded by family. With her faith in humanity restored.

She was now honored with the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) LifetimeAchievement Award, but by the time of the ceremony on January 10, 1993,she was far too ill to attend, and her graceful acceptance speech was read byone of her own favorite actresses, Julia Roberts: “I am proud to have been ina business that gives pleasure, creates beauty, and awakens our conscience,arouses compassion, and perhaps most importantly, gives millions a respitefrom our so violent world.”

As the end approached, when Sean asked his mother if she missed

“Granny,” she made no reply. Her mind was still on UNICEF and the chil-dren, and in Sean’s words: “She rallied for the last time and wanted to knowif there had been any messages from UNICEF about the children in Somalia.”Drifting in and out of consciousness she saw “the others. . . . She describedthem as ‘Amish people in a field,’ quietly waiting for her to the left of thebed.” When asked to explain, Audrey, sounding remarkably like “Hap” in Al-ways, softly replied: “You cannot understand. Maybe you’ll understandlater.” Added Sean: “It felt good to know that she had a strong sense of theother side, that she wasn’t scared.”

Gently asked by Sean if she held any regrets, Audrey replied: “No . . . butI cannot understand why so much suffering for the children.” After a pause,she added: “I do regret something. I regret not meeting the Dalai Lama. He’sprobably the closest thing to God we have on this earth. So much humour . . .so much compassion . . . humanity.”

In Sean’s detailed recall: “After she said that I sat down on the bed andheld her hand and told her I loved her. . . . She was lying on the same bed towhich I had been invited as a little boy to spend the night. I whispered that ifshe felt ready she should let go. I put her hand to my cheek to let her feel thewarmth of my tears. Somewhere, I felt she could hear me.”

A minister was called, and knowing that the end was near, last rites wereadministered.

Sean left his mother’s room and walked downstairs to speak with eachfamily member in turn. Luca was not present; at the urging of others, andagainst his better judgment, he had gone to the movies with his father. Theintercom rang with an urgent message from Giovanna: “Come quickly.”

Audrey Kathleen Hepburn died at 8 p.m., January 20, 1993, the day ofPresident Bill Clinton’s first inauguration. A mere seventy-nine days hadpassed since her operation in Los Angeles, and only six days since the offi-cial letter on White House stationery informing Audrey of her PresidentialMedal of Freedom. At the end of the letter President Bush had taken the timeto add a handwritten note of congratulations: “We are very proud of you.”

In an act of sheer willpower, she had chosen to die when her room wasempty of family. In Sean’s recall: “She hadn’t wanted to die with me in theroom. To make it easier for me, I guess.” Said Luca: “I always thought—butwho knows the truth?—that she was too shy to die in front of me. Becausefor her I was always ‘the little one.’ I was 22–23 at that time, my brother

Sean is 10 years older. And my mom was never worried about her condition,she was more worried about us, wondering if we were ready to cope withouther being around us.”

Love of family trumped all.

# Chapter Fifty-FiveANNOUNCING THE NEWS, 1993

“Audrey was a lady with an elegance and a charm that was unsurpassed,except by her love for underprivileged children all over the world. God hasa most beautiful new angel now that will know just what to do in heaven.”

—Elizabeth Taylor

AUDREY’S DEATH WAS ANNOUNCED, FITTINGLY enough, not by a Hollywood publi-cist, but by James Grant, the director of UNICEF: “Children everywhere willfeel her death as a painful and irreplaceable loss.” Her passing was not theoccasion for typical Hollywood-style obituaries—rise to fame, best movies,bad movies, peccadillos, and personal life. Instead, there was a straightfor-ward acknowledgment of her talent and films, followed by in-depth looks ather life-changing work for UNICEF. Such was the nature of the tributes thateven her extraordinary looks were now framed in terms of her honest—inother words, non-Hollywood—approach to life. Said the New York Times:“As unwilling to fake youth as she had been to fake voluptuousness, shelooked like the 63 year old woman she was. Which is to say, better than any63 year old woman who’s pretending that she isn’t.”

Her death generated worldwide headlines and tributes from heads of state,but true to her wishes, her funeral on January 24 was to take place at To-lochenaz’s small Evangelical church; Maurice Eindiguer, the same ministerwho had married Audrey and Mel and baptized Sean, came out of retirementto conduct the service before 120 invited guests.

Four days after Audrey’s death, as the funeral procession slowly wound itsway through the small Swiss village, people lined the street in order to paytheir respects to “Madame Audrey.” In fact it was only during his mother’sillness and funeral service that Sean came to fully understand the extent of his

mother’s fame and what she meant to people around the world. “My motherdidn’t behave like a movie star in any way. I only connected to it when I sawthe effect she had after she became ill; the cards and notes were so volumin-ous that it became a joke with the mail lady. In our small town she used amoped to get around and deliver the mail, but she had to get a truck to carrythe big bags—the type you’d use for your leaf clean up—that were filled withget well wishes for my mother. We had to store them in the attic—we couldnever have answered all of them—I’d still be writing today. On the day of herfuneral, in our little village of six hundred people, there were thousands ofpeople . . . lining the streets to pay their respects. It was like a rock concertwith cars parked everywhere along the road. People walked miles to come. Itwas very, very touching.”

Those who could not find room in the tiny church listened to the brief ser-vice while standing outside, silent while the choir of St. George’s Interna-tional School in Montreaux sang a moving rendition of the twenty-thirdPsalm, “The Lord Is My Shepherd.”

UNICEF’s Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, a friend of forty years stepped into deliver an impromptu tribute when Givenchy broke down in tears. Seanread Sam Levenson’s “The Beauty of a Woman” and delivered a eulogy inwhich he emphasized: “Mummy believed in one thing above all: She be-lieved in love. She believed love could heal, fix, mend, and make everythingfine and good in the end.”

Her pale oak coffin rested upon a flower-bedecked catafalque but was it-self adorned only by a cross and the words: “Audrey Hepburn 1929–1993.”The coffin was carried to her gravesite by six men: Robert Wolders, Sean andLuca, Hubert de Givenchy, Audrey’s brother Ian van Ufford, and former hus-band Andrea Dotti. Mel Ferrer attended the funeral, looking frail and dis-traught, hanging back until Sean called out to him: “Come, Papa.” Hugged byRobert Wolders, and his eyes filling with tears, Mel followed the others asher coffin was carried to her gravesite at the top of a small hill overlookingLake Geneva. Interviewed after the service, Alain Delon explained: “Shebrought joy and was loved by everyone.” For an emotional Givenchy it wasall “still unthinkable.”

There were dozens of floral tributes from the household names with whomAudrey had crossed paths, but it is likely that nothing would have meantmore to her than the flowers from UNICEF carrying the message: “From all

the world’s children.” Surrounded by nature, she would rest for eternity in thetown she loved above all others.

Four U.S. presidents sent condolence letters to Robbie Wolders, andTiffany placed her photograph in store windows, alongside the evocative cap-tion: “Audrey Hepburn—Our Huckleberry Friend 1929–1993.”

Eight days before Audrey died, the Board of Governors of the Academy ofMotion Picture Arts and Sciences had voted to honor her with the covetedJean Hersholt Humanitarian Academy Award; two months after her death, onMarch 29, 1993, the award was presented by Gregory Peck and gracefully ac-cepted by Sean. It was a well-deserved posthumous honor, but the most af-fecting tribute of all came from Anthony Lane in the Independent on Sunday,who simply wrote: “When Audrey Hepburn walked into the movies, allheaven broke loose.”

# Chapter Fifty-SixBEQUESTS, 1993–2000

“The Meaning of Life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give itaway.”

—Pablo Picasso

IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS after Audrey’s death, as memorial contributionsflowed into UNICEF, the public began asking questions about a will. Whowere Audrey’s beneficiaries? Was there even a will? Audrey Hepburn, themeticulously organized woman who had kept loose-leaf binders detailingevery one of the possessions with which she traveled, dying intestate like Pi-casso, Abraham Lincoln, and Howard Hughes? Never.

The majority of her estate was divided equally between Sean and Luca inthe form of properties and the extremely valuable film memorabilia, whichmeant that when it came to jewelry and furnishings, few specific bequestswere left to the two young men: Sean received a pair of Bulgari gold and dia-mond earrings, a gift from Mel Ferrer to Audrey at the time of Sean’s birth,while Luca received a pair of Bulgari pearl and diamond earrings. In a similarvein, knowing that Hubert de Givenchy and Robert Wolders were comfort-ably established on their own, the two men were simply gifted two Russianicons and two silver candlesticks, respectively.

Jewelry was, in fact, first left to relatives: Yvonne Quarles van Ufford re-ceived a diamond brooch in the form of a W, Sandra Quarles van Ufford apearl solitaire ring, Evelyn Pinkerton (nee Quarles van Ufford) a pearl neck-lace with sapphire fastener, Michael Quarles van Ufford a small oil paintingwith butterfly, and Andrew van Ufford two silver candlesticks.

Close female friends were also included in the will, with Doris Brynner re-ceiving a Bulgari emerald and sapphire brooch and earrings, Victoria Brynner

a Tiffany diamond and platinum flowered brooch, and Christa Roth(UNICEF colleague) a platinum Tiffany brooch.

Maid, cook, and close friend Giovanna Orunesu received $\$ 25,000$ (U.S.)as well as a pearl solitaire, small diamond solitaire, and Tiffany earrings,while monetary bequests of $\$ 25,000$ were also left for Rucchita Orunesu, En-gracia de la Rocha, Gina Cristoforetti, and gardener Giovanni Orunesu.

Of perhaps most interest was the disposition of Audrey’s beloved La Pais-ible. There proved to be no difficulty with the distribution of the propertiesshe owned in Saanen and Lully, but it was the sale of La Paisible in 2000 thatseemed most fitting to the legacy of Audrey herself. The house was sold notto the highest bidder but instead to the people who seemed best suited to thespirit of the house. Explained Sean: “One family in particular came to us,they were friends and they had one little boy who had palsy and was in awheelchair. We thought that would be the right thing: this garden that sheloved so much, would play a very important part in his life and we felt thatwould be a good thing. He actually ended up in my room, and what used tobe my second closet became the elevator.”

# Chapter Fifty-Seven

# PROTECTING THE LEGACY, 1993–2024

“Celebrity Net Worth reports that Hepburn was worth $\$ 55$ million at thetime of her death. . . . This included a Los Angeles storage locker full ofmementos and memorabilia.”

—Leslie Veliz, “Here’s Who Inherited Audrey Hepburn’s Money after SheDied”

VERY SOON AFTER AUDREY’S DEATH, her grave grew into a tourist destination forthose wishing to pay their respects. Told by a cab driver that he and his fel-low drivers undertake “sixty, seventy trips” there every day in the summer,Sean reflected in amazement: “That’s in addition to the tour busses withpeople from all over the world that stop in front of the house and go to thecemetery. So that’s hundreds of people per day that visit this little town offive hundred people. That’s a lot of people passing through.”

Given the popularity of her gravesite, and determined to protect theirmother’s image and legacy, Sean and Luca organized an exhibit entitled“Timeless Audrey,” which traveled the world beginning in 2009. Two yearslater the “Audrey in Rome” exhibition ran from October to December atRome’s Ara Pacis Museum, and in 2019, the same year in which a statue ofAudrey was erected in Velp, Sean organized “Intimate Audrey,” an exhibi-tion launched in Brussels in celebration of what would have been her nineti-eth birthday. Featuring memorabilia, dresses, videos, her writings aboutUNICEF, and even the Vespa scooter from Roman Holiday, the exhibition,one Sean called a “living biography,” proved to be a huge success, attractingforty thousand visitors.

As it became increasingly clear that Audrey’s popularity was continuing togrow with each passing year, Sean and Luca began to jointly grapple with a

looming problem: how to protect their mother’s name and likeness and pre-serve the integrity of her legacy. This led to what Sean describes as the trade-marking of “her name, signature, and image in every jurisdiction in theworld, so it can’t be misappropriated for commercial reasons.” The AudreyHepburn Estate was now able to protect Audrey’s name from unlawful use,and yet, as explained by Sean in a 2016 interview, such was the reach andpopularity of her image and brand that there were still “two, three dozen law-suits going every year for medium to important unauthorized use of her nameand likeness, or ‘piracy.’”

Although Audrey had divided her estate equally between her two sons,difficulties arose regarding the distribution of career memorabilia, becauseher handwritten will failed to specify which items were to be Sean’s, andwhich would pass to Luca; at stake were scripts, costumes, awards, andposters, as well as her personally annotated Breakfast at Tiffany’s script. Withsome items valued well into six figures, the stakes for the memorabilia,which had been kept in a Los Angeles storage locker, grew high. The broth-ers ultimately came to an agreement that each would retain the personal itemsalready in his possession, with the remaining items—specifically the ex-tremely valuable film memorabilia—to be auctioned at Christie’s, withprofits split equally.

After Sean took on an additional position as the first ambassador forEURODIS, the European Organization for Rare Diseases, he left his top posi-tion at the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund, and Luca assumed the positionof chairman. Perhaps inevitably, given the scope and worldwide range of thename and image involved, intrafamily disagreements of varying strength andduration ensued. Explained Sean: “When I created this foundation, Holly-wood for Children, I created a DBA so that we could control the intellectualproperty rights associated with my mother’s image. I quit the board of theAudrey Hepburn’s Children Fund because I wanted to implement some cost-cutting measures during the 2008 financial crisis, and I was outvoted by therest of the board. My brother came in and had a very different vision for mar-kets like China. I grew very concerned about protecting the identity and im-age.”

Lawsuits were filed, and the matter went before Los Angeles SuperiorCourt judge David Sotelo, who conducted a nonjury trial of the issues in thespring of 2019. In a ruling handed down in October of that year, the judge

ruled that Sean and Luca are co-owners of the Hepburn right of publicity andthat their joint unanimous consent is needed for any licensing of the AudreyHepburn image taking place after March 2013. (The judge further ruled thateither Ferrer or Dotti, acting alone, can terminate a license if there is nolonger unanimous consent due to one of them removing his approval.)

Whatever their differences, what would have pleased Audrey is that bothof her sons seem to have inherited her determination to combat the problemsplaguing the world’s poorest countries, utilizing the power of her image andlegacy to specifically address the problem of dehydration. It remains a solv-able epidemic thanks to oral rehydration therapy, and in the words of DavidNalin, the first doctor to utilize that therapy: “No other single medical break-through of the twentieth century has the potential to prevent so many deathsover such a short period of time and at so little cost.”

Wrote Sean in his memoir Audrey Hepburn: An Elegant Spirit: “The worstkiller of all is dehydration from diarrhea caused by unclean drinking waterand malnutrition. It costs five dollars to vaccinate a child for life, 6 cents willprevent death from dehydration and 84 cents per year will stop a child fromgoing blind.” In Luca’s book of recipes and remembrances, he speaks directlyof oral rehydration therapy as a tool which has saved over fifty million peoplefrom dysentery; in fact, what likely would have pleased Audrey most of all isthat right alongside her favorite pasta recipes, Luca goes on to present the re-cipe for oral rehydration: eight teaspoons sugar and one-half teaspoon saltdissolved in one quart of drinkable water.

In their respective ways, both Sean and Luca continued to honor theirmother’s overriding concern to help the impoverished children of the world.Films and fashion? Fine, she would have said, but nonessential. Her sons us-ing their books to let people around the world know about oral rehydrationtherapy? She would have found nothing more important.

# Chapter Fifty-Eight

# GENERATIONS OF ACTIVISM, 1970–2024

“She always used to say, ‘If you ever have a doubt in life, do what’s bestfor the other person. Take yourself out of the equation and you will seemagically, everything will work out.’”

—Sean Hepburn Ferrer

IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING HER death, Robert Wolders, Sean, and Luca focusedon continuing Audrey’s charitable endeavors, taking their first step throughan Audrey Hepburn Pavilion, housed in a converted schoolhouse in To-lochenaz. From 1996 until 2002 when the museum closed, 30,000 people vis-ited the pavilion, raising $\$ 275,000$ for UNICEF.

The men then founded the Audrey Hepburn Foundation, and in the oftenbyzantine ways of nonprofits, there was a concurrent creation of the AudreyHepburn Memorial Fund at UNICEF; that fund morphed into the “All Chil-dren in School” project before growing into the Audrey Hepburn Society,termed by Sean “the big donor club of the US Fund for UNICEF.”

Running these charities became a full-time job for Sean, and he hadstopped his work as a film producer in 1993 to focus his attention on them. Inhis own evocative phrase: “I never got that wink from the entertainment in-dustry. Certain projects didn’t happen. Oh, I worked—I made a nice living.But after my mother died, I decided to take the baton and continue this ex-traordinary legacy of grace and generosity—that will be the focus andeverything else will dance around it.”

By then he had seemingly found the film industry not just frustrating butoft-times empty of purpose, filled with self-important players capable of los-ing all perspective in a pursuit of glory. Expanding on the topic in an inter-view, he explained: “And it’s always the B minus and the B plus who behave

the worst, and the superstars mostly . . . behave like princes. The really well-known people are nice.”

Sean’s time began to be taken up by the Audrey Hepburn Society for theUS Fund for UNICEF, where he served as the first chairman and oversawcampaigns that raised over $\$ 140$ million. “We have a full office, with law-yers, assistants, licensing directors, executive directors for the fund, book-keepers, etc. We’re like a small company, and we have agents and law firmsall over the world.”

This activism continued a family tradition which had begun with Ella’swork on behalf of American soldiers returning from Vietnam in the 1970s.Explained Sean: “When my parents got married, Ella passed the baton oflooking after my mother to my father. It was time for a new phase in mygrandmother’s life, and she decided she wanted to live in San Francisco. Itwas while living in San Francisco that she began working with Vietnam vet-erans who were encountering problems readjusting to civilian life.” AlthoughElla’s turn away from a youthful infatuation with fascism had certainly takenhold while the Second World War was still raging, her efforts in San Fran-cisco represented the final fruits springing forth from a now much differentworldview. In Audrey’s words: “My mother always wanted to be useful, andshe impressed that upon us.”

From Ella to Audrey to Sean and Luca, and now on to Sean’s children—adaughter, two sons and two stepchildren. Explained Sean proudly: “Mydaughter is already working with UNICEF and the UNHCR, the United Na-tions Refugee Agency. That is our family culture. I don’t like the word char-ity because we’re beyond charity now. The effort must be to restore people’srights.”

Working with the Seoul-based Tree Planet organization, in April of 2015Sean and his family traveled to Korea to help families devastated by the tra-gic ferry accident of April 16, 2014, in which three hundred died. “We wentthere as a family, not as official representatives of the Audrey Hepburn Chil-dren’s Fund. We thought it would take two months to raise the necessarymoney to plant a forest of trees in honor of the victims, which we wouldname the Audrey Hepburn Memorial Forest. We held a big press conference,and within forty-eight hours we had raised the necessary money—$250,000.It was as meaningful for us as it was for the families of the people lost in thetragedy.”

That family trip to Korea seemed to serve as impetus for Sean’s daughterEmma’s dedication to UNICEF, although Emma’s awareness of service toothers had started

As early as I can remember—because of my father and his work forthe children’s foundation. The idea that those of us who have beengiven so much should give back felt to me like second nature.

In 2016 I had a meeting with Caryl Stern at UNICEF USA. Wemet after I first moved to New York and I was instantly ready topress “go,” but Caryl very smartly said “Wait—pause: if you want tomake a difference you need to find the cause that you care about somuch that not getting involved is simply not an option.”

So, I waited a little bit. I was in Italy and Spain, and there hadbeen a huge influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East. Iwould watch the news and see harrowing images of young peoplewho had drowned in their desperation. It was all very disturbing, andI realized that this was the cause that spoke so personally to me.

Through the United Nations High Commission on Refugees(UNHCR), I was able to put together a mission trip with a director ofUNHCR and also with my good friend Michael Avedon, the grand-son of Richard Avedon. We visited a refugee camp in Greece—Mi-chael took photos and I conducted one-on-one interviews withrefugees. These were families who had fled their homes and arrivedin Greece or Turkey with almost nothing. The EU relocation schemewould then try to get them out of the refugee camps and into morestable situations. And yet—the staggering statistic I learned is thatthe average amount of time spent in a refugee camp is eighteen years!

I did some writing about the experience for the UNHCR andthey made me a national ambassador in 2016. I then spoke at fun-draisers in Washington, DC, Houston, and other cities.

There is a deep familial bond that only this kind of work makesme feel. Of course, I have had a connection to my grandmotherthrough my father, but connection in other ways has not always beeneasy; her image, her success as an actor, her status as a fashion icon—it all seems like a larger-than-life entity. But this has let me feel an

intimate bond with her legacy, a new way to understand who she wasand what she did. Her field trips, the press, the raising of funds—itwas revolutionary and changed the direction and dialectic of celebrityhumanitarian work today.

Caryl Stern, who served as CEO and president of UNICEF USA from 2005through 2019 feels that “Emma carries on Audrey’s legacy in ways thattrump everything else. She really does have the grace of her grandmother, hercompassion and devotion to the cause, and has become iconic to the nextgeneration who only know Audrey from her films. When she speaks, shespeaks so genuinely and from the heart about what her grandmother did thatit makes the legacy come alive all over again. She can capture full ballroomswith thousands of people with the same modesty and grace as her grand-mother. In her own way and on her own terms, Emma is continuing Audrey’sgreatest and most important legacy.”

In Emma’s own words: “What I know in my heart is that my relationshipwith UNICEF will always be present.” In the most personal of ways, “thiswork has also given me a feeling that I am at last truly in touch with mygrandmother.”

# Chapter Fifty-NineAUCTIONING HISTORY, 2017–2018

“It is with great joy that we seek to share her spirit, through this sale, andits related previews, with all of those who have enjoyed her films and hersense of style, and who have followed her humanitarian legacy.”

—Sean Hepburn Ferrer and Luca Dotti

IN 1996, WHEN THE COSTUME jewelry hair ornament Audrey had worn in Break-fast at Tiffany’s sold for $17,285, it became clear to all that her film memor-abilia would only continue to grow in value each year. The idea of a memor-abilia auction began to percolate; what Sean and Luca did not want was a re-petition of the non-family-sanctioned 1998 Christie’s auction of twelve lettersfrom Audrey to her father and step-grandmother, which had brought in a cool$\$ 72,000$ . Referring to the 1998 sale of letters, Sean explained: “We were up-set about that. These were personal items that belonged to my grandfatherthat were sold by my step-grandmother. I respect that people have needs intheir lives, but she did not make an effort to speak to us first. We had alwaysbeen there for her, helped her out when she needed it. We weren’t thrilledabout it.”

Eight years later, worldwide press attention was generated by the an-nouncement that Christie’s would hold a Givenchy-approved auction of theblack dress Audrey had worn in the first scene of Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Ofthe three dresses Givenchy designed for the film, the first dress had remainedin the Museum of Costume in Madrid, and the second in the archives atMaison Givenchy, but the third dress had been retained by Audrey. She sub-sequently returned the dress to Givenchy—in fact, before her death, she gaveGivenchy twenty-five of his dresses that she had worn—and it was he whodonated it for auction to benefit his friend Dominique Lapierre’s City of Joy

charity for children in India.

The charity waited until December 5, 2006, before auctioning the dress atChristie’s, where it sold for $\$ 922,000$ , nearly seven times its presale estimate.(The $922,000 far surpassed the previous costume auction record holder,Judy Garland’s blue gingham dress from The Wizard of Oz, which had soldfor $\$ 226,000.$ ) Said Sarah Hodgson, who was part of the Christie’s team run-ning the auction: “The dress—it was made of amazing Italian satin you can’tget any more. It was incredible because the dress almost stood up on itsown.”

After the final bid had been entered on behalf of an anonymous Europeanbidder, Lapierre exclaimed: “There are tears in my eyes. I am absolutelydumbfounded to believe that a piece of cloth which belonged to such a ma-gical actress will now enable me to buy bricks and cement to put the mostdestitute children in the world into schools.”

By this time, even errors regarding the Hepburn legacy could be turnedinto UNICEF fundraising possibilities. In 2001, the German Postal Servicehad printed fourteen million stamps featuring Audrey as Holly Golightly; theoriginal image had depicted Audrey with a pair of sunglasses hanging fromher mouth, but the postal system flipped the negative and the sunglasses werereplaced by Holly’s cigarette holder. When Sean refused to grant permis-sion/copyright because of the alteration, the sheets were destroyed, with just afew retained—by the postal system archives and the German postal museum.Among the still extant stamps were those that the German Postal Service hadsent Sean back in 2001 for his approval, and in 2010, he agreed to auction asheet of ten stamps, with two-thirds of the proceeds flowing toward theAudrey Hepburn Children’s Fund and one-third to UNICEF. That one sheetof stamps sold for 430,000 euros.

Having noted the extraordinary sums garnered by these auctions and want-ing to take matters into their own hands regarding their mother’s memorab-ilia, Sean and Luca now sanctioned an auction at Christie’s to be held overthe course of three days in 2017. Consisting of hundreds of items the brothershad personally approved for sale, the lot ranged from a hand-embroideredGivenchy gown designed for Sabrina to a Balthus drawing personally in-scribed to Audrey.

With the provenance of each lot hand-signed by the two brothers, they ex-plained the reasoning behind the auction: “We preserved our feelings for her

as well as her belongings, each of which signified her life’s choices andphilosophy. After 24 years we have focused on those items that we wished tokeep, as well as those we are pleased to pass on to future generations.” Filmfootage of Audrey’s two sons examining the exhibit is accompanied by recol-lections both poignant and practical; in Luca’s words: “When you find outthe world is in love with your mother, there’s a hint of jealousy and then littleby little you understand that it’s a privilege.” Noted Sean quietly: “Her entireestate was less than I think an actor gets paid for one film today.”

Twelve thousand people visited the presale public exhibition of the collec-tion, and the first of the three auctions, on September 27, 2017, attracted on-line, telephone, and salesroom bids from forty-six countries and six contin-ents. In the process, a record was set for the highest online participation in thehistory of Christie’s, and the frenzied bids by fans determined to own a pieceof the Hepburn legacy seemed to take even seasoned auction observers bysurprise. To wit:

The Breakfast at Tiffany’s blue satin sleep mask with lace-trimmedflowers attracted the highest number of bidders for any lot in the auc-tion. The final price of 6,250 pounds proved to be fifty times the presaleestimate.

Audrey’s personal Gigi script: 25,000 pounds.

Audrey’s script for The Nun’s Story: 27,500 pounds.

A tiara, worn to the London premiere of The Nun’s Story: 43,750pounds.

Cartier lipstick holder: 56,250 pounds, nineteen times the presale estim-ate.

Audrey’s own three-quarter-length lined Burberry trench coat: 68,750pounds, 10 times the estimate.

A two-piece Givenchy cocktail gown made of black satin and worn inCharade, sold for 68,750 pounds—the same price as her Burberrytrench coat.

A 1963 Cecil Beaton photograph of Audrey in My Fair Lady: 93,750pounds, thirty times the presale estimate.

As the auction continued, the pace of the bidding increased:

Audrey’s working script for My Fair Lady, dated June 24, 1963. Presaleestimate: 30,000—50,000 pounds. Final price: 206,250 pounds.

A 1969 painting by Audrey entitled My Garden Flowers. Winning bid:224,750 pounds.

A Tiffany bangle inscribed with the message “You are my inspiration,”given to Audrey by her Always director Steven Spielberg: 332,750pounds.

# And:

The ultimate show-stopper: Audrey’s working script for Breakfast atTiffany’s. Final sale price: 632,750 pounds.

Total proceeds: 4,635,500 pounds/$6,202,299. Seven times the original es-timate.

The second and third auctions, featuring movie memorabilia (a Sabrinacall sheet—1,500 pounds) as well as personal mementos (a Bulgari cigarettecase—11,250 pounds) raised another 648,625 pounds.

What, one wonders, would have been the reaction of Audrey herself to theextraordinary prices commanded at these three record-setting auctions? Mostlikely incredulity. A concern only for whatever portion of the proceeds wouldbe given to UNICEF.

Because, in her own words: “Giving is living. If you stop wanting to give,there’s nothing more to live for.”

# Chapter SixtyEVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN, 1993–2021

“Now, $5 0 \%$ of her fan base are teens and tweens. She has replaced JamesDean on that closet door in kids’ bedrooms. It’s quite extraordinary.”

—Sean Hepburn Ferrer

AUDREY HEPBURN NOW SEEMS to have transcended her own era, in the processjourneying from postwar modern woman of the 1950s to timeless femaleideal in the twenty-first century. In the thirty years since her death, her appealappears not only undiminished but actually seems to increase with each suc-ceeding year, with fan websites continuing to pop up in languages rangingfrom French, Dutch, and English to Polish, German, and Japanese. Her ever-growing presence is now so large that there is even an Audrey fan club withinthe Pokémon community.

Instagram now holds more than two million images hashtagged #AudreyHepburn, and the iconic opening scene from Breakfast at Tiffany’s has pickedup more than eight million views; the clip of Audrey singing “Moon River”doubles that total. Her image, particularly from Breakfast at Tiffany’s, ap-pears on magazine covers, notepads, coffee mugs, calendars, and books.

That ubiquitous image has influenced how Emma Ferrer has processed thelegacy of the grandmother she never knew:

My grandmother was such a beautiful woman, inside and out, andwhat she represents to me changes with time—what she represents tonew generations is changing. I remember a conversation with myfather when I was younger, and we passed a woman who was carry-ing a bag with my grandmother’s face on it. He pointed to it and said:“That’s your grandmother!” I knew it was something big but I didn’t

know exactly what it was. As time went by, I realized “She’s reallyfamous!” I’d go to friends’ homes, and they had posters of her. It wasreally in high school that I started to realize I had a nuclear familymember who was a worldwide icon. I’m actually still learning abouther; I haven’t seen all her films because I want to keep discoveringher.

I’ve never tried to imitate my grandmother’s look. She was thefirst to say everyone should be themselves, and certainly if I copiedher look there would inevitably be a backlash. When I started model-ing, I would sometimes read comments online—people were prettytough. Some people wanted me to be a carbon copy of my grand-mother and they would judge harshly on appearance, while otherssaid I was my own person. I realized that her legacy and image are abigger deal than I could have imagined.

People write to me today on Instagram about how much of animpact, a truly deep personal impact, she has made in their lives. It isvery heartfelt—they talk about the values she represents, values theypine for and that we see in so few places nowadays. Over and over,they speak of what a huge influence she remains on how they want tolive their lives.

That ever-growing influence has blossomed into a worldwide phenomenon,with a 1999 American Film Institute (AFI) poll rating her the third greatestfemale film star of all time, topped only by Katharine Hepburn and BetteDavis. The cult of Audrey is largest of all in Japan, where she has morphedinto a legend; a 1990 Japanese poll taken by the television companies NHKand JSB found Roman Holiday voted the public’s favorite foreign film of alltime (Gone with the Wind placed second). Another Japanese poll rating theworld’s most well-liked historical figures found that Audrey ranked aboveGandhi. The Japanese identified with Audrey in a way they could not with,say, Marilyn Monroe, because, in the words of Luca Dotti, Audrey was ac-cessible, “tiny, elegant, and discreet, with dark hair and almond shaped eyes.”For a country in which manners and politeness remain of paramount import-ance, Audrey’s genteel and thoughtful style continues to prove eminently re-latable.

The Audrey-centric cultural conversation, in which she morphed fromsymbol of nostalgia to cultural icon, had actually begun to take shape whileshe was still alive: Whitney Houston’s 1990 video for “I’m Your Baby” ref-erenced Funny Face, while in that same year, People magazine namedAudrey as one of the fifty most beautiful people in the world. In June 1996,three years after her death, the cover of Harper’s & Queen featured a photoof Audrey from Breakfast at Tiffany’s with the headline: “The most alluringwomen in the world”; the article inside named Audrey the number-one mostfascinating woman of the modern age.

Products ranging from clothing to liquor all want a connection to Audreyin hopes that her image will impart a sense of respectability and fun to theirproduct. A 1990s ad for Gordon’s gin used her image, as did one for Panteneshampoo, and by 2002 the product endorsements had traveled full circle, withthe Parfums Givenchy marketing of a “modernized” version of L’Interdit per-fume: “Created for Audrey Hepburn. Once Forbidden. Now Reborn.”

She was honored with a Legends of Hollywood U.S. postage stamp in2003, just as the rush of clothing companies wanting to be associated withher accelerated. The Racing Green clothing retailer dubbed their capri-stylepants the “Audrey Trousers,” while in the most high-profile of product asso-ciations, a 2006 Gap ad used the “Basal Metabolism” dance number fromFunny Face to highlight their version of the little black pants. Thirteen yearshad passed since Audrey died, yet there on worldwide television screens wasa computer-generated image of Audrey dancing across screens to rock groupAC/DC’s “Back in Black.” The ad ended with the tagline “It’s back. Theskinny black pant,” and even called the pant “the Audrey Hepburn pant.”

In reality, the campaign was not a particular success. Television audienceshad years to get used to Elizabeth Taylor’s White Diamonds perfume ads be-cause they began running while Taylor was still alive; seeing Audrey dancein an ad more than a decade after she died, however, proved more than atouch disconcerting. Then again, it may just be that the pants themselveslooked impossibly skinny for ninety-nine percent of the population.

The relative failure of the Gap campaign did nothing to diminish her al-lure, however. Five years later, the queen of pop culture, Beyoncé, echoedthose same Funny Face black pants in her video “Countdown,” while in2014, a computer-generated Audrey appeared in an ad replete with referencesto Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany’s in order to tout the delights of

Dove chocolate; by one account it took a full year of work to produce thissixty-second ad.

Unsurprisingly, it remained the references to Breakfast at Tiffany’s whichcontinued to echo most strongly. Ads for Elizabeth Arden fragrances featureda woman wearing a dress deliberately styled in the mode of Breakfast atTiffany’s, and in that same year, Oliver Goldsmith re-released sunglasses likethose worn by Audrey in the film. By now, it seemed, her Breakfast atTiffany’s persona had become an industry unto itself.

References even abounded to Audrey on television, and she was name-checked in shows ranging from The Simpsons to Seinfeld. On CSI: NY threewomen dressed as Holly Golightly to rob a jewelry store, while on GossipGirl the lead character fantasized herself as Holly. Whatever the show, hername was intoned with near reverence, and always in terms of style andgrace. It therefore made a perfect kind of sense that on the very first episodeof Sex in the City (1998), the main character of columnist Carrie Bradshaw(Sarah Jessica Parker) delivered a series-defining voiceover narration that ref-erenced Audrey Hepburn, Deborah Kerr, and Cary Grant in two brief sen-tences: “Welcome to the age of un-innocence. No one has Breakfast atTiffany’s, and no one has affairs to remember.” Three names, all of them in-stantly marking a bygone era of elegance and savoir faire.

It was in the season 4 finale of Sex and the City that the reference toAudrey as avatar of elegance was made even clearer. Arriving at Mr. Big’s(Chris Noth) apartment, Carrie finds one of his parents’ albums featuring“Moon River”; as Carrie and Big begin dancing, the sophisticated Mr. Bigquietly recalls how his parents would listen to “Moon River” as they dressedup in their finest for Saturday night parties. As he describes the ritual andvery look of his parents readying themselves for a night on the town, he en-capsulates the entire distance traveled from Breakfast at Tiffany’s to a mod-ern-day world bereft of glamour and civility.

It was therefore no accident that before the largest possible worldwidetelevision audience, Audrey and Breakfast at Tiffany’s were even invoked inthe opening ceremonies for the 2012 Olympic Games. The reference, cour-tesy of a recreation of the film-ending kiss in the rain, was executed withoutirony, comment, or subtext, with Audrey’s graceful, romantic air acknow-ledged in a straightforward, nearly wistful manner.

Tributes continued, not just in fashion and television but also in music,

with the song “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” featured on a CD released by the rockgroup Deep Blue Something. The Hepburn allure remains especially evidentin literature, where the homages began with a well-received 1996 novel byAlan Brown entitled Audrey Hepburn’s Neck. Subsequently turned into a2011 movie, the book centered around a Japanese boy who sees Roman Holi-day at age nine and, overwhelmed by the beauty of Audrey Hepburn, forms alifelong preference for Western girls. This was followed by the 2000 novel InBeautiful Disguises by Rajeev Balasubramanyam, a British-Indian authorwho fashioned the tale of a sixteen-year-old girl living in South India who es-capes her difficult family life via fantasies about My Fair Lady and Breakfastat Tiffany’s. Audrey even starred as herself in Sean’s 2021 children’s bookLittle Audrey’s Daydream, as well as in 2011’s Just Being Audrey; written byMargaret Cardillo, with illustrations by Julia Denos, the sweet natured-bookfeatures Audrey in episodes taken directly from her own life, and it even gen-erated its own YouTube trailer.

The unending tributes in one medium after another lead to one overarch-ing question: Why? What is it about Audrey Hepburn, a movie star whose ca-reer was all but finished a half century ago, that speaks to successive genera-tions with a power that seems to grow with each passing year?

It is, Sean feels, her authenticity that underlines such continuing popular-ity: “People know instinctively that there is something real there, that besidesthe fashion and movies, she put her entire being into trying to save childrenthrough UNICEF. That’s why the teens and tweens today look to her as theirpied piper and that’s how I’d like her to be remembered. Her outward eleg-ance was matched by her inner beauty.”

The epitome of glamour, wealth, and fame—the trifecta of life’s goals ac-cording to the incessant messages on the social media that rules today—Audrey nonetheless figured out how to live an authentic life by turning herback on the church of fame. In a modern world where the once exalted posi-tion of star seems to have been usurped by the cheap currency of reality tele-vision, her persona, films, and way of life remain both current and effort-lessly rewarding.

Not a flash in the pan, not a passing fancy, but a role model for the ages.

The very last Golden Age Hollywood star.

# Chapter Sixty-OneTHE LAST GOLDEN AGE STAR

“How did we drift so far from Audrey Hepburn? Can we ever get back?”

—Tweet by CBS Television correspondent Mo Rocca

AUDREY HEPBURN REMAINS THE VERY last golden age larger-than-life movie starfor one simple but important reason: careers like hers are no longer possible.From the late 1920s through the early 1960s, movie stars possessed a certainmystique, their images carefully curated by studio publicists whose job it wasto shield the stars from overexposure. Stars appeared almost deliberately outof touch with the citizens of Main Street USA, and that behavior proved acrucial part of their appeal. Only occasionally descending from Mount Olym-pus to mingle with everyday citizens, these stars increased their allurethrough their very inaccessibility. No one, it is safe to say, would have de-manded a selfie of Greta Garbo or Audrey Hepburn.

Tom Cruise, George Clooney, Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and Ju-lia Roberts are names, stars even, but there is nothing otherworldly aboutthem; theirs is a different type of stardom, one deliberately modeled upon aphilosophy of “I’m just like you—you won’t catch me putting on any airs.” Itis stardom as a reflection of life in the twenty-first century—we have lost thelast vestiges of innocence that allowed the public to believe in the Hollywooddream factory.

It all plays out as a result of changing mores, increased cynicism, and dif-ferent societal expectations, but when it comes to stardom, the ultimate gamechanger proved to be social media. When the movie star formerly glimpsedthirty feet high on the silver screen posts incessantly about his or her life,reasons to pay eighteen dollars to see them on that screen have vanished.Streaming the movie at home suffices.

It is the ever-tweeting, photo-posting public with whom actors now com-pete for bandwidth. As stars now proudly post Instagram photos of familyand friends, straining to remain in the consciousness of a public saddled withan ever-shortening attention span, the very concepts of privacy and allurehave vanished. Forever. Logically enough, the biggest stars of today are su-perheroes—the only figures who remain inaccessible.

Shifting standards of acceptable behavior further rocked the very conceptof stardom; bad behavior from stars in Hollywood’s golden age was usuallycovered up by studio fixers, but the same behavior today is now oft timespublicized before being repositioned as a marketing opportunity for apologyand redemption. Statements, tweets, and Instagram posts increase in dizzyingprofusion until the original offense fades away.

Publicists remain busy, but Sean Ferrer sees a possible day of reckoningcoming as a result: “All these dramas about celebrities are going to embitterpeople about the very notion of celebrity. If they continue to disappoint us,we’ll end up hating them all. I hope it won’t happen to my mother becauseshe was never about herself—she continually gave back. Black Lives Matteris an important movement, and my mother was fighting for that very ideathirty years ago in Africa through her work for UNICEF. I hope she’ll sur-vive any inevitable revisionism and attendant fall from the Hollywood pan-theon.”

What would Audrey have made of the social media which plays such a bigrole in maintaining a star’s “brand” today? Never a snob, but definitely re-strained beneath her gracious manner, Audrey would seem an extremely poorfit for an electronic world running on the fuel of oversharing. And yet shemight well have embraced social media, not for the purposes of her acting ca-reer but instead to spread the word about UNICEF. Sean, in fact, posits thathis mother would have adapted nicely to Instagram: “Well, she really was thequeen of Instagram because she was more photographed than anyone else.”

Fifty years ago, lasting movie stardom like Audrey’s was helped by thefact that movies possessed a longer shelf life. There were no DVDs orstreaming services, and a movie was likely five years old before it could beshown on television. Nowadays, even big budget movies like MartinScorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) are streamed on televisionwithin weeks of release, and it seems a near truism that the more readilyavailable the films, the briefer the career of the Hollywood star. Familiarity in

this case does not breed contempt but rather indifference on the part of thepublic. With hundreds of films readily available at the flick of a switch, whoreally feels a personal connection with a star as the public did with Audrey?Where exactly are Hilary Swank, Marion Cotillard, and Brie Larson as boxoffice draws today? All Academy Award winners in the twenty-first century,all talented, and none a galvanizing figure.

Audrey’s time as a movie star—roughly 1953–1968—may read as some-what truncated when compared to the Bette Davises and John Waynes of theworld, but seventy years on, the power of her personality and image loom lar-ger than ever. The images of her contemporaries like Marilyn Monroe andElizabeth Taylor may often seem like remote relics from the past whenviewed in the context of the twenty-first century, but Audrey’s image stillreads as current. Unlike the continuing fascination with the life and career ofMonroe, the interest in Audrey has never focused upon either her death orany sense of tragedy. Instead, she is looked to as an inspirational source oflife wisdom, a Hollywood star who is not the subject of tell-all biographiesbut instead the raison d’être of books entitled What Would Audrey Do?, 100Reasons to Love Audrey Hepburn, and in a nod to the twenty-first century,How to Be Audrey in a Kardashian World.

While Monroe’s and Taylor’s private lives were plastered all over newspa-pers and magazines, in Audrey the public found a star whose private life andscreen image seemed to have achieved synchronicity while remaining pleas-ingly remote. A little time away in the mountains of Switzerland did a greatdeal to increase interest in the answer to the age-old question underlying trueHollywood stardom: What is she really like?

In some ways, Audrey’s image as the last golden age star remains power-ful precisely because of its mid-twentieth-century origins; in the 1950s and$^ { \prime } 6 0 s$ , life may not have been any simpler than it is in the twenty-first century,but in retrospect it seems so to many, and Hollywood has always thrived onillusion. When it came to the sexual dynamic that fueled romantic comediesand dramas, no one in the middle of “the American century” spoke of hetero-normatives, cisgender, or nonbinary identity. There were simply men, wo-men, and, as the old joke had it, girl singers. Audrey, upper class but down toearth, the paragon of a certain type of femininity pitched at the burgeoningmiddle class, projected an image which flattered her audience’s conception ofitself.

Traditionally feminine on film, Audrey Hepburn nonetheless always spokeher mind and proved more than capable of holding her own in any onscreenbattle of the sexes. Her persona, short on sex and long on romance, combinedstrength of character with an iron-tinged vulnerability that seemed to speak ina curiously modern way to the notion of having it all, impossible though thatidea may be for men and women alike. In the words of one commentator, sheremained “the only comedienne capable of brushing her teeth while stillmaintaining her glamour.”

It was that glamour that actually has increased Audrey’s appeal in today’sdecidedly dressed-down world. Her attention to appearance, whether swan-ning in Givenchy or walking in jeans and a Lacoste shirt, always registered,forming a marked contrast to the ever-informal stars of the twenty-first cen-tury. Says Sean:

She always looked good, even at home where she dressed casually.She was never in sweats with her stomach sticking out. It was allvery different from the actors and actresses of today. They go outwearing UGG boots and jeans and that’s a reflection of the fact thatit’s a different time. Everybody has the right to be real, but as anactor you’ve chosen a career where you’re supposed to project a cer-tain style or persona. It plays out differently now, and it also playsout differently in terms of the length of your stardom.

You don’t get to be the most beloved actress and style icon ofthe last century, and now a pied piper for teens and tweens in thetwenty-first century, without a tremendous respect for planningthings and attention to details. My mother understood the importanceof all this—I think she understood the importance of selling oneticket at a time. But now, maybe, the concept of movie star is fin-ished. There are actors, not stars. You’re on and you’re off, begin-ning and ending with the performance.

In a particularly reflective moment, Audrey once mused: “How shall I sumup my life? I think I’ve been particularly lucky.” But the luck, it seems, wasnot Audrey’s but her audience’s. Because when you’re the most beautiful girlin school, the best-dressed cool kid who could ruthlessly rule the room but in-

stead chooses to be the nicest person on the scene, then everyone wants toknow you, to know how to live a more meaningful life like yours.

It is just such a meaningful life that was perfectly summed up by photo-grapher Bob Willoughby in terms anyone, male or female, would wishspoken about them at the end of their days: “She was one of the most beauti-ful women I have ever photographed, and yet, I felt all her beauty came frominside and it radiated out to everyone around her.”

# Chapter Sixty-TwoAND IN THE END, 1929–1993

“Love is action. It isn’t just talk and it never was. . . . We are born with theability to love yet we have to develop it like you would any other muscle.”

—Audrey Hepburn

If actions speak louder than words, then the Audrey Hepburn Life Lessonscould be said to run as follows:

Give of yourself.

No matter the task at hand, put forth your best effort.

Manners represent kindness. Remain humble.

Leave the world improved in at least one small way.

Stay true to your own inner compass and author a style of your own.

No one will remember the latest dress or opening night, but everyonewill remember generosity and a smile.

Only connect.

Ask yourself—how well have I loved?

The hard-won wisdom which allowed Audrey to separate the truly important—family, children, kindness—from the passing fancy of Hollywood stardom,had granted her a clarity of vision: the meaning of life, she stated, was “not tolive for the day—that would be materialistic—but to treasure the day.” Famecould not solve any problems except those of finance, but treasuring the dayand helping others did pave the way to genuine happiness. In her own smilingacknowledgment, she exclaimed: “I heard a definition once: Happiness ishealth and a short memory! I wish I’d invented it, because it is very true.”

In the case of Audrey Hepburn, the loss of her father and the suffering shewitnessed in World War II combined to propel her away from the glittery sur-

face toward an appreciation of the eternal verities. She took her family andUNICEF seriously, but never herself. For all the heft of her screen legacy,she left the lightest of footprints, refusing to draw attention to herself, and in-stead redirecting the spotlight toward others in need.

Emma Ferrer thinks of her grandmother’s legacy as one of kindness, mod-esty, and virtue, adding, “Really, her legacy is contained in the Sam Leven-son poem she loved so much. ‘We have two hands—one for helpingourselves and one for helping others.’ That’s what she would say, and it sumsup how she lived her personal life and conducted her professional career.”

Caryl Stern has thought about the Hepburn legacy, but always in termsthat stretch far beyond the years of Hollywood stardom: “I think her legacy isthat there are things in the world more important than yourself. You can usewhatever power you have to address them, and that’s what she did. She is theepitome of ‘I have a podium, and I can make a difference. I’m going to grabit and take it and use it.’ I think about when I was a little girl, watchingBreakfast at Tiffany’s and wanting to grow up to be this beautiful actress—and then I grew into an older woman who looked again at Audrey and said ‘Idon’t want Breakfast at Tiffany’s—I want to go to Africa like she did. I wantto make a difference.’ That’s her legacy. She set a standard for all of us.”

Audrey herself always emphasized kindness above all else: “I feel sostrongly that’s where it all starts, with kindness. What a different world thiscould be if everyone lived by that.” She was, in her own way, the living em-bodiment of the Henry James aphorism that “three things in human life areimportant: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; and the third is tobe kind.” In this she succeeded more fully than any other actress in the his-tory of Hollywood.

Early in Sabrina, Audrey/Sabrina is shown writing in her diary: “I havelearned how to live, how to be in the world and of the world, and not juststand aside and watch.” It seems oddly prescient that those words, spoken atage twenty-five in only her second leading role, somehow came to defineAudrey’s own journey through life. After decades of striving, she had,through her sons, her work with UNICEF, and yes, her screen immortality,succeeded in fully living in and of the world, never standing aside just towatch.

Her best films—Roman Holiday, Sabrina, The Nun’s Story, My Fair Lady,and Two for the Road—will continue to be shown for decades to come, and it

is indisputable that Audrey herself remains the single most important factorin making those films endlessly watchable. In the words of Billy Wilder:“God kissed her on the cheek and there she was.”

In the long run, however, her legacy remains far bigger and more import-ant than that delivered by her films or fashion, and for the most personal andimportant of reasons: in gaining an understanding of her own pain and vul-nerability, she used her fame to give back on the largest of internationalscales, literally saving lives and making the world a better place.

After years plagued by self-doubt and disappointment in her own best ef-forts, she had succeeded in living a generous yet perfectly human life, onethat ultimately did nothing less than fulfill the ancient Greek definition ofhappiness so often quoted by President John F. Kennedy: “The full use ofyour powers along lines of excellence.”
